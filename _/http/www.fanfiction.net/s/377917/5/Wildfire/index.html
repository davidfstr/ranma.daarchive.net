The ripples quickly became a swirl, and then a miniature whirlpool formed with a column of light lancing toward the ceiling. Without a sound, a weary looking black haired girl arose from the shallow water and drifted out over the dry wood flooring of the bath chamber.</p><p>"I'm back," the girl called out.</p><p>"We're in here," was the faint reply.</p><p>Moments later, the young girl pulled open the door beside a sign labeled in kanji and english 'Tea Room,' and trudged wearily through.</p><p>"How was your night, Skuld?" Belldandy, the middle Norn and Goddess of the Present asked. "Did you find the bug you were looking for?"</p><p>Sighing, Skuld plopped down beside her older sister. "... no. I thought I had it this time. But, it was her again."</p><p>"Oh, dear," Belldandy exclaimed "You didn't, did you?"</p><p>Dropping her head, the younger Norn replied softly, "... yes."</p><p>"I-I see." Skuld's older sister said sadly. She watched the young Goddess of the Future for a moment before asking, "What did you do to help her?"</p><p>Skuld's tear filled gaze snapped back up to meet her older sister's calm eyes. "I couldn't find her again, Belldandy. When I got to the location of the bug, I tried to debug it. But somehow, it must have fooled my tracker. It made me hit her instead."</p><p>Belldandy nodded and urged her to continue.</p><p>"Well, when I hit her,somehow I hit her so hard, it knocked her out of the district. So, I followed. But when I got to the park where she was going to land, all I found was this, this, PERVERT."</p><p>"Oh, MY!" the older Norn exclaimed, "What happened?"</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>Skuld was searching the park, looking for the red-head she had twice now been tricked by that fiendishly clever Alpha bug into attacking. According to her calculations, she should have landed right about... here.</p><p>"Akane-chan!" a voice exclaimed from the surrounding bushes. "I knew you would come to me."</p><p>With that... a withered barnacle of a letch latched onto Skuld, who, in shock, could only reply with a startled, "YeeeeEEEEEEK!"</p><p>"Oh dear! What happened next imotou-chan"</p><p>"It was horrible, oniisama."</p><p>"Eh? Your not my Akane-chan." the barnacle complained.</p><p>"YeeeEEEEEEEK!" Skuld cried again.</p><p>The barnacle dropped to the ground with a huff, not even bothering to look at her. "Ahh, my pretties!" It cooed, rubbing a silky white piece of cloth to its face.</p><p>"Yee...ERK!" Skuld's screams cut off abruptly as a flush of righteous anger grew upon her countenance.</p><p>"Who would have thought a little girl would have such a delightful pair of panties?" mused the barnacle, continuing to ignore the gathering storm known as Skuld.</p><p>"You-You, YOU P-PERVERT!" the offended Goddess of the Future screamed. "Neo-Skuld BOMB!"</p><p>"Oh. Wasn't that a bit... no. On second though. He had that coming."</p><p>Genma Saotome hitched his pack up a little higher as he trudged through the outskirts of Tokyo. It was time for another training trip, at least until he found a way to fix what the boy had done to himself. Nodoka would never let him live otherwise. She was scary. There was no other way to put it. She could be so kind and gentle one moment, and a complete and utter terror the next. Her family always had been a bit... off. Why was it that the boy couldn't thank him for taking him away from her?</p><p>No, best not think on it. The only side she has ever shown Ranma was her kind side... especially when Ranma was hiding as Ranko Tendo. Ranma never knew her as he did. The last year before the esca... errr.. trip had been nearly unbearable. The only peace he got was when he was with Ranma. Whenever they boy was taking a nap or out playing with the neighbor's kids, the torment continued. 'Clean up that mess. Eat like a civilized human being. Fix the leak in the roof. Carry the shopping bags.' But the worst was, 'Go get a job'. Sheesh. What did she think he was, anyway? Her family had money. It was one of the things he had married her for.</p><p>The last ten years had been utter bliss compared to the eight years of marriage before hand. Granted, the first two years of that, before they found she was pregnant with the boy, had been all he could ask for. A better wife, a man couldn't ask for. She was everything a woman should be. Attentive. Willing. Wonderful cook. Neat and thorough housekeeper. Obedient... had he mentioned willing?</p><p>Genma's mental list of his vision of a perfect wife was interrupted by someone barring his path.</p><p>"Going somewhere, Dearest?"</p><p>"Milady?"</p><p>"Milady? We have arrived."</p><p>Haisano blinked and looked about. Sure enough, the limousine was parked a block from her destination.</p><p>"O-Ok. Thanks." the said, "This may only take a few minutes, but if its gonna be longer, I'll try to let ya know."</p><p>"I shall wait as long as you need me, Milady." The chauffeur replied, after opening the door for her.</p><p>"Just Haisano, please." she protested.</p><p>"Yes, Milady Haisano." the driver countered.</p><p>Shaking her head, Haisano walked down the street. She had tried to stop him from calling her 'Lady' and 'Milady' on the trip from the Saotome home, but to no avail. Stopping a short distance from her destination, she shrugged off the chauffeur's stubborn behavior and focused on her next actions. Before moving on, she slipped into Umi-senken.</p><p>Khu Lon glanced up at the entrance to the Nekohaten as another customer entered and sighed before turning her gaze once more to the waiting tea. An entire day lost, waiting for him... No. Waiting for her. She had a fondness that bordered on the feeling of family ties to the egotistical martial artist.</p><p>Ranma was entirely too clever for his, or her, own good. There was no way the boy could have made it to China, acquired the Chiisuton and Kaisufuu from the Musk, and returned in only a month. A small smile tugged at her lips. The bucket had nothing to do with the Chiisuton anyway. It was, in fact, the ladle that was enchanted. The entire act of locking herself as female was a ruse, a grand trick upon that pathetic excuse for a father of his and all the other suitors for his hand -her hand.</p><p>Of greater interest was how Ranma had resisted the curse... and how long had his female form exhibited the marks of the gods? Khu Lon felt certain she was very familiar with Ranma. No one could spend as much time training a person of such talent as she had and not gain a sense of whom that person was. No, this had to be a recent development. But when? And, more importantly, how?</p><p>Jusendo was the key. It had to be. According to his own words to that Tendo girl, he had not had the strength to defeat Saffron. The fight with the Phoenix God had forced the young man to seek a greater power to enable his victory. A power that Ranma implied had slept in him since his first visit to Jusenkyo. But, how could that be? The records of Jusenkyo clearly indicated that Ranma fell into the Spring of Drowned Girl. That spring had been in near constant use by the Musk Dynasty for centuries, and none of their new 'brides' had become megami. If they had, then the Musk would not have lasted much beyond the first.</p><p>Only the Legendary First Spring, the Spring of Destiny, might have the power Ranma had described. That spring was where, according to legend, the Warrior Goddess, guardian of the early Amazon nation, fell to the treachery of the unspoken male warrior possessed by the demon Zetsubo Hagesii. It was this treachery that had resulted in there being no male allowed on the council of elders since.</p><p>Bah, the point was moot anyhow. According to the Jusenkyo records, the First Spring had dried up nearly a week before Ranma's entry into the book. That in and of itself was a relief. The entire village had celebrated for weeks once the news was out. With the spring gone before he even arrived there were no chance that Ranma could have fallen into it. Better still, with it gone, Zetsubo could not be released from his prison.</p><p>Perhaps ...no. It wasn't actually possible for him to have fallen into the Spring of Destiny, was it? Most people who fell into that spring took form closely reflecting their soul, as with that beast Taru. Some, however, took forms as close to the opposite as possible to the victim, such as Rogue. Genma had raised Ranma to be an arrogant male chauvinist, who also happened to be terrified of cats. It would only stand to reason that the Spring of Destiny would have turned him into an ugly, overweight, beast of a man in the first case, or a timid female cat-human creature in the other. But, the first truly didn't fit Ranma either. He may have been raised that way, but underneath all the crass arrogance and macho bravado, a caring and forgiving soul lay. Perhaps...</p><p>No, the only possibility was unthinkable. Were Ranma to have actually fallen in the Spring of Destiny, and somehow merged with the spirit of the springs, then that would mean Ranma would have to have been at Jusenkyo an entire week before he was recorded to have been. The Guide was very diligent with the records of the First Spring of the Pools of Sorrow. There is no way he would fail to record the fate of a new victim. Also, Ranma would have to have the reborn soul of the Goddess, otherwise, he could not have merged with the spirit of the spring...</p><p>Unfortunately, it was the only thing that made sense. If it were true, then the events of the prior evening could mean that Zetsubo was about to escape his prison. According to ancient lore, he could only get free if the magic of the Pools of Sorrow was gone. With the entire valley flooded after Jusendo, there was no safe means of determining whether or not the magic remained.</p><p>"I don't think I have ever seen you actually look worried before, elder Khu Lon." Commented an all too familiar voice, interrupting her thoughts. Startled as she had not been in years, Khu Lon could only stare at the girl that appeared from nowhere, standing at the other side of the table. No one else in the Cat Cafe reacted in any way at the girl's sudden appearance nor paid any attention the slight jerk of her own hands that resulted in a puddle of tea on the table.</p><p>"Honored elder. I apologize that unforeseen events prevented us concluding our business last night. I seek your decision." Ranma's tone remained low and calm, yet her eyes seemed to burn with an intensity that Khu Lon had never before seen in the child.</p><p>Slowly and calmly, Khu Lon wiped up the spill, filled two fresh cups on the table, and arranged them to allow Ranma to chose her own. "Please, join me for some tea, daughter."</p><p>Haisano bowed politely to Kuno's driver. "Please extend my gratitude to Kuno-san for your services. They were greatly appreciated."</p><p>"I will do as you ask, Lady Haisano." The man bowed in return as he replied. "I am honored to have been of service. Are you certain you wish to stay here? Should I drop you off at a hotel perhaps?" he asked one last time, glancing at the City Park.</p><p>"No. Thank you, but no. I ..." she turned her head as she yawned massively. " I will be fine... I've spent years on the road with my fa... with Genma. I had to look out for myself then, I can do so again now." She had given up about midway through the journey on getting the man to drop the 'Lady' bit. She may have accepted the curse, but she still did not like the gender change, or the reactions of the people around her.</p><p>"As you wish, Lady Haisano." Bowing one final time, he returned to his vehicle, and carefully guided it once more into the light night traffic.</p><p>Sighing in relief, Haisano turned back to the entrance to the park, adjusted the strap to her backpack, and started in. After a few minutes of searching, she found a secluded spot to drop her pack for the night. She set up her portable stove and fished a small pot form her pack. After setting some water to heat over the tiny flame, she set aside the packet of instant ramen, waiting for the water to heat as she shivered slightly in the evening chill.</p><p>It was not the most nutritious or filling meal, but, for some reason, she just wasn't that hungry. She was, however, extremely tired. Ever since the sun set, it had been harder to stay awake in the back of the limousine for the return to Juuban. Not wanting to fall asleep and awaken back at the Kuno mansion, she had the driver drop her off, here, at one of the many parks in the Juuban Ward.</p><p>It was time to decide where to go from here. Her life up to this point had been a never-ending chain of challenges and combat. Whatever good it had done for her combat skills, it had a serious impact on her other skills. Whoever the spirit was that had come to her from the spring, she corrected some of that, but she still felt incomplete. It was as if pieces of her were still missing. It was a strange feeling. It was almost as if she was remembering things, that Ranma had never experienced while growing up. She felt far more complete than she had ever felt as Ranma... and yet... there was more that still seemed to be missing.</p><p>Perhaps the thing to do was to look for a place to finish her schooling. Even better, since she was basically starting anew and certainly looked young enough, she may even be able to go back and take some classes she had missed or not performed as well at over the last year.</p><p>Lost in her thoughts, her hands were left on autopilot, so to speak. With the skill and instinct born through the better part of two years, her right hand grasped the handle on the steaming pot of water... and upended it over her head. As tired as she was, she had long since ceased maintaining the curse lock technique. She shuddered under the familiar tingle of the change and then grunted the sudden but brief tightening of his clothes.</p><p>"Awww! What the heck did'ja do THAT for?" He groaned, annoyed at himself. After setting up the pot to heat some more water, he moved a few feet away, and reached for the technique he had used twice earlier that day. Immediately, he felt a difference. He was expecting only a trickle of warm power, as tired as she was. What he received was a frigid tsunami.</p><p>Instead of a the expected flash of warmth and steam, the temperature plunged around him in an instant. With a sound not unlike breaking glass, shards of ice formed about him and shattered in an instant from the intense chill. Ranma stared in shock at the glimmering motes of powdered water drifting about him in shock. The water he had intended to burn off into steam had frozen so rapidly and completely, it hadn't even set off the curse again.</p><p>"Whoa! What the...?" he broke off as he clamped down on the power, struggling to force it back and contain it once more. The cool blue-white glow of his aura illuminated the impromptu campsite clearly. A strange metallic pinging sound from his stove drew his attention. As he watched, the water in the pot solidified despite the efforts of the small gas stove. Shortly thereafter, when he recovered control enough to release the technique, the glow died. A cool fog formed in the clearing as a warm breeze that blew through carrying a flurry of snowflakes.</p><p>Wait a sec. Warm? Shaking his head, Ranma scratched the back of his neck under his short ponytail. Just a few moments ago, she had been shivering from the chill. Now the crisp evening air felt comfortable... even warm to him.</p><p>"This just keeps gettin weirder. That was even more intense than the soul of ice..." he muttered. Kneeling before the little camp stove, he closed his eyes to meditate while waiting for the water to heat once more. Perhaps some light could be shed on this. His eyes opened again as the puzzled look grew. Why wasn't he tired anymore? If anything, he could feel himself becoming more alert with each passing second.</p><p>His gaze turned toward the stars and the full moon hanging in the sky. As usual, their cool radiance calmed him as he thought over the events of the past few days. Closing his eyes once more, he settled into a light meditative state.</p><p>Ryoga was lost. A simple fact. It was, unfortunately, a simple fact that was all to common to the young man. What was different this time was the fact he had no idea where he wanted to go either. Worse, no matter how hard he tried, or how long he walked, he continued to find this same park bench, under that same statue, near that same pond, by that same grove of trees with the blue light glowing in it.</p><p>"Huh?" Okay, that was new. As he watched, the blue light abruptly vanished. Looking around, he noticed no one else was nearby in the park. The other people were staying towards the far side, near the main entrance. He was probably the only person to see it.</p><p>Like a moth to a flame, and with as steady a course, the lost boy wandered into the grove to investigate. Moving carefully, and with all the stealth his stalking of that ronin had given him, at least when he wasn't charging through the brush in a blind fury, he crept through the grove with only a whisper of sound. The trees were not tightly packed, but the underbrush obscured most of this area from the remainder of the park. He finally got a good look at the figure kneeling between a small camp stove and a pup tent.</p><p>His eyes bugged out as he drew in the sight of Ranma... a MALE Ranma, meditating, his eyes closed and his hands relaxed in his lap, all while hovering more than six inches off the rippling blades of grass. Ryoga almost missed the faint marks glowing with a cool blue radiance upon the cowardly oathbreaker's face. This did cause him to pause for a moment... but only a moment.</p><p>In a mid sized house in a well to do part of Juuban, a young teenage girl slept deeply, happily dreaming of one of her favorite things in the whole world, ice cream. Unfortunately for her, the dream was about to be interrupted.</p><p>Beep Beep!</p><p>"hrmm..." the girl rolled over and resumed chewing on her pillowcase.</p><p>Beep Beep!</p><p>Beep Beep!</p><p>"...usagi..." came the whispered voice of the moon cat.</p><p>Beep Beep!</p><p>"Usagi! Wake up!" A little louder that time. At least it got some response.</p><p>"Yes, Momma, I'll have the triple fudge..." but hardly the one sought after.</p><p>Beep Beep!</p><p>"USAGI!" The cat screeched from atop the pillow Usagi was chewing on.</p><p>"Aaak! Huh? Wha? Luna?" With an explosion of hair, elbows, and yet more hair, the young blonde bolted upright in bed.</p><p>Beep Beep!</p><p>"U...usagi...?" came the groan from the far side of the room.</p><p>"Awww! Not now Luna. It's the middle of the night. Can't I get some sleep?"</p><p>Beep Beep!</p><p>"...Oh..."</p><p>Sailor Mercury, fought back the yawn as she followed the latest trace from her computer. This was the second time in one day that the Senshi were responding to a disturbance. Luckily, Minako had been able to catch the Shinkansen (bullet train) from Kyoto. Even on the high speed train, it had been more than a two hour trip for the misplaced scout. She had just arrived at the commuter rail station in Juuban when this latest disturbance erupted. It wasn't one of Beryl's Youma, of that Mercury was certain. No, this was something altogether different, more like the traces in Nerima and earlier today here in Juuban..</p><p>Her computer warbled a warning tone as a surge of power was detected ahead of Ami. She slid to a halt atop the roof as she glanced at the screen of her communicator. "It's in the park." She informed the rest of the team.</p><p>"Of course it is... Seesh it's ALWAYS in a park..." whined one of the Senshi... probably Moon.</p><p>"I... I'm almost there..." Mars began then screamed "WOAH!"</p><p>Ami's eyes were drawn to the sky by the sudden appearance of a green sphere of energy that shot up from the park. It hovered in the sky for a moment, casting a sickly green glow over the trees and rooftops, before plunging once more toward the ground. A flare of light erupted where it landed, followed seconds later by the sounds of an explosion and a tremor that shook windows and set of alarms for blocks.</p><p>"Mars?" Moon called, "Are you alright?"</p><p>Mercury started running towards the park once more.</p><p>"Mars?" Moon tried again, but there was no answer. "Mercury! Find Mars!"</p><p>Pausing once more in her run, Ami checked her computer, and replied, "She is at the north end of the park, at the opposite end of the park from the attack. She is not moving; however, the enemy appear to be ignoring her."</p><p>"Oh, No! Is she hurt? Everyone get to Mars, as quick as you can!"</p><p>Moments later, Mercury arrived to find the rest of the Senshi gathered around the sobbing figure of their teammate who, aside from her expression, appeared unharmed. "Is she alright, Sailor Moon?"</p><p>"I don't know, she keeps saying she's all alone, even though we're all right here."</p><p>"So dark, So lonely" moaned the black haired Senshi of Fire.</p><p>A pair of flaming green eyes blazed in the unending darkness. A vague form, the silhouette of a man, hovered in the dark, outlined by a dim glow of a similar hue. Before it, a barrier shimmered like the surface of a sunlit pond as viewed from below. Beyond, a distorted image of the mortal realm danced, taunting the figure with occasional glimpses of crystal clarity. Over the millennia, as the number of mortals in the world grew once more, the barrier had weakened. His power grew in proportion to the number of mortals, while the power that held him trapped was fading at an increasingly rapid rate. If it had been this weak a mere five decades prior, he would have been free then. That last wondrous slaughter of mortals by mortals had given him an unexpected surge of power. Enough power contact Gekido for a time.</p><p>But, as with all things, the war came to an end. The vast stream of power faded, and once more, the barrier was as good as impregnable. Having learned from that experience, he has been carefully hoarding his strength, keeping it instead of wasting it in what had been futile efforts to breach the barrier. Recently, less than a half a year past, a mere blink in the time he had suffered here, the barrier weakened enough for him to restore contact with Gekido following the death of that fool Saffron.</p><p>She was to pave the way for his return. She was to find a host for himself. She found a host for herself soon enough, and claimed to have one for him, yet, the time was not right. The host was not prepared. Her attempts at placing the host in a suitable frame of mind met with continuous failure. When she wasn't working on the host she had selected for him, she wandered off to other projects of her own. Like now...</p><p>"Gekido, what are you up to now?" He wondered. "You have invaded yet another body while you leave me to rot here. I shan't forget this slight, dear sister. Oh, no. I shan't forget. But wait! What is this?"</p><p>Waving a hand, He altered the pattern of the ripples with practiced ease, shifting the view slightly. "Ahhh! The emotion! Where?" Another gesture shifted the view again. "Yes, my pet! Again. Show me where you are... so pure! Yes! Give in to it. Fill yourself with Despair. Show me! Show ME!"</p><p>"There you are..." The ripples of the barrier danced faster and sharper, obscuring the vision beyond even more. But millennia of staring at the same portal allowed Zetsubo to see far better than any mortal would have. The sight of his 'pet' thrashing about, throwing punches and kicks about him, and shattering the very ground upon which he walked excited Zetsubo as no other ever had.</p><p>"Even better than I could have hoped. My pet is a warrior already! That will ensure my revenge will be that much sooner."</p><p>The ripples increased suddenly in intensity as Zetsubo's excitement grew, wiping the scene away in what was, even for him, an impossibly fractured vision.</p><p>"...no..." he whispered. "...no... You cannot take my pet from ME..."</p><p>"...no..."</p><p>"NOOOOO!" With a howl, eerily echoed from beyond the barrier, the Zetsubo's prison was bathed in the fires of the Incarnation of Despair. The barrier, hastily erected in the first place, and weakened from the millennia, finally gave under the last onslaught as it is effectively attacked from within and without.</p><p>Ranma had hardly begun his meditations when he sensed a familiar aura approaching. Carefully suppressing his own aura, he readied himself for a fight. It was not very likely that Ryoga would talk before attacking.</p><p>Carefully stretching his senses toward the wanderer, he tried to determine the lost boy's emotional state. Hmm... depression, loneliness, frustration and curiosity. Wait. What was that? A tenuous thread of that other power was wrapped about Ryoga like some form of ethereal leash. It led to ... it lead back to Ranma!</p><p>His own curiosity peaked, Ranma reached out carefully and gave the strand a tentative mental 'tug.' Instantly, it seemed to strengthen, drawing some energy from Ranma as well as the lost boy. Ryoga's wandering path became arrow straight, as the strand linking them intensified. The surge of energy up the strand briefly illuminated a multitude of other threads spread out and reaching off in every direction.</p><p>Giving the thread a firmer 'tug' pulled a few loops from the coils wrapped about Ryoga and left him with a faint double image. Concentrating a bit more allowed Ranma to make out a ghostly form of a pig merged with the more substantial aura Ryoga possessed.</p><p>Suddenly, a wave of exhaustion broke his concentration. The last image he received was of Ryoga's aura fading to near invisibility as that of the pig surged to the front.</p><p>"RanmaaaAAA! You coward!" Ryoga yelled at the hovering form of his nemesis. "I'll KILL you for what you've done!"</p><p>He began his charge toward Ranma, only to gasp as a sudden sharp pain stabbed into him. His aim thrown off by the pain and the strange double vision, he stumbled into the camp. His umbrella plowed through one image of the hovering Ranma and smashed into the small camp stove. The small battered pot resting atop the stove spun off into the night, spraying its still frigid contents about the camp. Ryoga felt the familiar change of his hated curse course over him. As his body was swallowed by the clothing he wore, he had the satisfaction of seeing Ranma's curse activate. He took even greater pleasure from the look of shock upon her face when she fell to the ground.</p><p>As Ryoga struggled within the enveloping folds of his clothing, he head Ranma's voice, heavily laden with exhaustion. "Gee, Ryoga. What did that pot ever do to you?"</p><p>"I was aiming for you, you blockhead!" Ryoga squealed out, then grunted, "Damn this curse," in lower tones.</p><p>"I know Ryoga." She responded, as if she could understand him. " 'Die, Ranma' and 'This is all your fault, Ranma.' Well, what is it this time? What horrid thing have I done to you now?"</p><p>As if Ranma doesn't know, Ryoga thought. His struggles to free himself intensified as he felt her approach. He didn't stop to think of how he knew she was moving closer... he just knew.</p><p>"Come on, lets get you out of there." Ranma said as he... she... whatever, moved the pack off of him, thus allowing him to squirm out of the heavy Autumn weight clothes he had been wearing. Quickly, he dashed to the other side of the clearing and spun to face his hated rival.</p><p>Ryoga glared at the girl kneeling beside his pack. Somehow, she looked... different. She let go of his pack, allowing it to slam once more into the ground, before turning slowly towards him. It was hard to make out details in the moonlight, especially with his piglet eyesight, but she seemed to be shivering fairly violently. What could be wrong with her? With the soul of ice technique she shouldn't be bothered at all by this Autumn night air. He settled further into his modified pig-fu stance as her luminous eyes fell upon him. They almost seemed to glow in the cool moonlight.</p><p>"Come on Ryoga," she said wearily while carefully picking up her water bottle from nearby. "Lets get you back to your human form. Then, you can tell me all the horrible things Ranma has done to you this time."</p><p>Reminded of his anger, Ryoga growled and began focusing for an attack. He knew he was no match for Ranma normally, but maybe now... just maybe, he could beat her now.</p><p>"Please Ryoga," Ranma called from where she knelt, cradling the water bottle in her hands,"Nothing will ever get resolved if you won't talk to me. We can fight all you want afterwards, but wouldn't you want to be you instead of P-chan?"</p><p>P-CHAN! Ryoga growled again at that, but forced the anger back. It would be easier to defeat the coward as a man, instead of... instead of... instead of like he was now. Warily, he approached his nemesis.</p><p>"Thank you." She whispered as he approached.</p><p>When he was within reach of her, she closed her eyes and clutched the water bottle tighter. Ryoga opened his mouth in a snarl as he was about to yell... errr, squeal... at her in anger when the snarl abruptly vanished and his jaw dropped.</p><p>Her face bore the same five marks he had seen, but ignored before. Two slightly curved slash like marks under the corner of each eye, and a single larger starburst centered on her forehead. All of them began to glow faintly as her face contorted into a scowl of intense concentration. A flare of light drew his gaze down, to the water bottle clutched firmly in her hands. Her hands took on the same dim crimson radiance as the marks on her face. Almost instantly the water within the bottle began to steam. A wave of warmth briefly washed out from her before the glow on her hands and face fluttered and died.</p><p>Dumfounded, he stared at her. Not once throughout the display had he felt Ranma gather any ki. He barely registered the motion as her eyes opened once more and her hands carefully tipped the bottle over to pour an unsteady stream of hot water over his piglet form.</p><p>The activation of the curse did not go without notice, however, as he was suddenly wet, in a clearing, at night, and with the breeze it was COLD without his clothes on. Darting over to his pack, he dried off and dressed in record time. Spinning, he shouted out, "NOW, Ranma! ...HEY!"</p><p>"DAMN YOU RANMA! Wake up so I can kick your ASS!" he bellowed at the slumped form of his rival. Darting forward, he slammed into the unmoving form of his nemesis, sending her sprawling in a uncontrolled tangle of limbs and hair. "HA! Is that the best you've got Ranma? Get up and fight me... you... you coward!"</p><p>Ryoga glanced down and grimaced in annoyance at the hot water trickling out of Ranma's dropped water bottle. Stepping out of the small puddle, he studied his rival again, paying closer attention. He took in the pallid skin tone. Even taking into account the wan moonlight, she looked unusually pale. She lay in a twisted and uncomfortable position, and a stream of dark liquid snaked from her slack mouth.</p><p>"R-ranma?" Her only response, another ragged breath.</p><p>"Come on Ranma... This ain't funny!" Stalking over to her, he snagged her by the front of her blouse and shook her like a rag doll. "You are tougher than this, damnit! Stop fooling around. How am I supposed ta kick yer ass if you won't fight back?"</p><p>Zetsubo Hagesii opened his eyes. For the first time in several thousand years, he had eyes. For a long moment, he luxuriated in the simple pleasure of vision. Gradually, he opened to the other senses as he stretched, popping several joints into place in the process. Pain flooded through him. Pain. Even that was a wonderful change. Ignoring it, he let his 'host' deal with it... not that the man had a choice. Looking around, he was surprised to see the amount of damage inflicted on the area by the struggle his host had just undergone. Not bad. Not bad at all.</p><p>Frowning, he finally looked over the body he now possessed. It certainly would not have been his first choice, but then again, now that he was free of that damned prison... he had plenty of time to train or find another. Standing, he swept through a few basic maneuvers. He was pleased to note that the host had a well trained body. Again, not bad.</p><p>Sensing her presence without looking, he called out softly, "Hello, sister-dearest." Turning away from the deep shadows of the rubble, he moved to the center of the softly illuminated yard. "I am most... upset with you..."</p><p>"MMmmm," she purred, wrapping her arms about him from behind, "I love it when you get... angry, brother-dearest."</p><p>"Hmpf! Of course you do, Gekido," he grumbled, "of course you do. Tell me, why this one?"</p><p>"Well... you did specify a warrior..."</p><p>"From your reports, we both know there are others that are better than him."</p><p>"True. But they all have a stronger will... or other problems. Surely you didn't want to deal with the pig-boy's wonderful sense of direction..."</p><p>"...No."</p><p>"...or the duck-boy's wonderful vision..."</p><p>"...No."</p><p>"Oh! Then you must mean that cat-girl." She smirked and added, "I didn't know you wanted to try the other side this time."</p><p>"No!" He snapped, throwing off her arms. "What about Taro?"</p><p>"Yes. He is an excellent warrior. However, even though he has failed many times in his ridiculous quest, he never falls into despair, brother-dearest. His rage burns brighter each time. He would accept me long before you... and he just isn't my type."</p><p>"Hmpf... What then of that Musk Prince, Herb?" Zetsubo demanded, as he began pacing in agitation.</p><p>"No. He is far too strong willed to succumb to either of us even at our strongest, much less weakened as you now are. Besides, he is deep inside China, in his citadel, not here."</p><p>"So? What is so special about this wretched island?"</p><p>"Well, it has the greatest concentration of victims of Jusenkyo outside of the Bayankala range. This city is the one location over land where the barriers between the planes of existence are at their weakest. Granted, there are a few other spots where the barrier is weaker, but all of them are over open ocean, such as the Bermuda Triangle. I'm sure you would make a really fetching shark, or tuna." She grinned at his derisive snort.</p><p>And..." she paused, before finishing quietly, "she is here."</p><p>She gasped at in sudden pain. She found herself in a crushing grip as Zetsubo held her by the hair at the back of her head and glared at her, staring into her eyes. The pair stood like this for several long moments, her face clearly expressing her discomfort, before he snarled and threw her to the ground.</p><p>"I must have misunderstood you, sister-dearest..." he growled out, voice full of venom, as a dark green fire flickered momentarily in his eyes. "I know you cannot mean the one I swore to destroy. I know you cannot mean the very one who it was your task to prevent the return of. I know you cannot mean the one whose mortal analogs you were to track down and eliminate. I know you cannot mean the one I killed with my own hands! So, I know you did not just tell me she lives!" By the end of his tirade, Zetsubo was a raging column of green fire.</p><p>Gekido smiled inwardly. She relished the powerful rage burning in her brother as it stoked and fed her own strengths. Standing slowly, she brushed the dirt from her elegant kimono. Adopting a thoughtful look, she tapped her chin with one long finger.</p><p>"Well, you are probably right, Zetsubo. I mean, what are the chances that she would be reborn as a boy of all things. What are the chances that he would have an idiot of a father to take him on a decade long training journey, never staying in one location long enough to track. What are the chances that father would drag the boy to the very spot on this wretched planet where she died by your hands. What are the chances that she, having died at the same instant as a divine level reincarnation spell, would have a trace of her soul linger at that very spot just waiting for a chance to reunite. I certainly can't be to blame for that, brother-dearest."</p><p>"Hah! Face the fact, Gekido, you are a weak little girl and a failure!" The Demon of Despair smirked.</p><p>Gekido's eyebrow twitched as she forced herself to remain calm. The idiot had just been released. No, it wouldn't do to kill him, yet...</p><p>"Is that so, Zetsubo-dear? I was tasked with the elimination of any girl child born as her mortal analog. The fact is, there is not a single girl child on this worthless ball of mud born with even a spark of her soul that lived beyond her first year. I know, brother-dearest. I made sure of it! My task has been accomplished. My standing is secure! You are the one who failed. If you wish to receive any further assistance from me, you had best change your tone quickly and drastically... little brother."</p><p>"Hey there, kiddo! You are one hard person to find." A sultry voice penetrated the haze of pain and exhaustion. Groaning, Haisano blinked her eyes open...</p><p>"GAH!" she yelped as she blurred away from the glowering visage of Ryoga. Since when had he sounded like that?</p><p>"What the...?" she blurted before trailing off. Before her, Ryoga stood, his fist raised with his usual angry expression and dull green aura of depression. Dangling from his other hand like a limp doll was... herself. He was not moving. Correction... nothing was moving... except...</p><p>Spinning in midair, she found herself nose to nose with...</p><p>"Boo!"</p><p>"Gah!" Haisano yelped for the second time and found herself hovering four meters above the immobile Ryoga. "Don't do that!"</p><p>Smirking, the woman drifted up to her level and replied, "Why not? It is so much fun!"</p><p>"Who... who are you? I feel I should know you."</p><p>"Yes. You should know me." Looking about, she shook her head. "But, this will never do. Perhaps this will spark a memory."</p><p>With a wave of her hands, the darkened clearing and figures of Ryoga and Haisano disappeared with a ripple. The sky overhead lightened to a brilliant blue as the moon changed to the sun. Clouds rolled through a valley below the cliff the pair found themselves hovering over. Resting on the edge of the cliff, eyes closed as she basked in the warm summer sun, was a young red headed teen dressed in a threadbare gi. Haisano instantly recognized herself, but couldn't remember ever having done this. She hadn't word a gi like that since...</p><p>Her eyes widened as she took another look around. This... this was Jusenkyo. Turning to the stranger, she began to ask a question, but found herself hovering alone. Blinking, she looked back down as she heard a started yelp from below.</p><p>"W-who the he... he... HECK are you!" the younger Ranma stammered at Haisano's companion.</p><p>Ranma shivered as the woman responded with, "Hiya Kiddo! I'm glad to see ya."</p><p>"Uhhh..." Ranma replied "do I know you?"</p><p>"In a way." the tanned woman replied, "I'm afraid you aren't supposed to be awake yet."</p><p>"What d'ya mean?" Ranma asked, echoing Haisano's own thoughts.</p><p>The hovering woman held out a silver piece of jewelry to the redhead. "Here."</p><p>"What's this?" Ranma asked, looking at the clasp before stiffening and jumping back. "Hey! I ain't wearin no girly stuff like that! I am a Guy!"</p><p>Haisano smirked for a moment before her face froze, and an expression of wonder began to replace the surly smile.</p><p>"Not at the moment, Kiddo. But, if you keep this on you, you will be able to be Ranma without the pain." The golden skinned beauty replied as Haisano echoed her word for word from above.</p><p>Ranma's eyes lit up at that. "Y-you mean, that'll cure the curse?" The hope in her voice brought tears to Haisano's eyes as she shook her head and whispered, "No..."</p><p>Shaking her head slowly, her silvery hair rippling in the air, the floating woman explained, "No. What it will do is allow you to BE Ranma without the headaches. Water will still change your shape, but you will be able to be Ranma again."</p><p>The young red head pondered the offering for a few moments, before she stepped over to the woman and accepted the gift. She looked at the small silver amulet for a moment before looking up at the smiling woman.</p><p>"So... What now?" She asked. "If I wear it, Oyagi will probably steal it. I can't leave it in my pack for the same reason."</p><p>The woman's smile turned into a smirk as she gestured for Ranma to turn around. Taking the amulet back from the redhead, she proceeded to braid the girl's hair into a pigtail. At the base of the pigtail, she wove the amulet into the hair, concealing it, before braiding the remainder. Then, before the girl could react, she murmured a quick spell, sending the redhead into a deep sleep. As the redhead slipped into the enchanted slumber Haisano's companion said to her softly, "Don't worry Kiddo. You won't remember this until its time..."</p><p>Before Haisano could react, the scene blurred again returning to the darkened glade where she had set up camp. Looking over at the woman she now recognized, she glared silently until the silver haired woman's smirk faded.</p><p>"Why?" Haisano asked.</p><p>"Ahhh... 'why' what?"</p><p>"I didn't fall into the Nyaniichuan. Why did you make me forget that? Why did you make me forget you? Why did you make me forget... ME?"</p><p>Sighing, the woman replied slowly. "I did remove your memories of the First Spring and myself. Because of who and what I am, I cannot reveal myself to mortals. Until recently, you were just that. Mortal. Had you retained memories of what you could be... then the events of the past two years would have been drastically different. It was hoped that this day would never come, but... it has. When you awoke your powers earlier this year, events were set in motion that cannot be stopped. Now, you must awaken fully and face what is to come. However, I did not make you forget yourself. Even now, you are not... YOU, Haisano."</p><p>"What do you mean, I am not myself?" Haisano demanded, "Of course I am myself! Who else would I be?"</p><p>You are far more complete now than you were at Jusenkyo. That is true. Ever since Jusendo, you have recovered most of yourself. However, there are parts still missing. You must recover as much as possible before you face Zetsubo again."</p><p>Haisano's eyes narrowed. This woman was repeating what she herself had felt earlier this evening. She had not spoken of this with anyone. "What do you mean? And what the heck do I have to despair about?" Aside from loosing nearly everyone she had once cared for.</p><p>"Not despair, as in the emotion, but Zetsubo Hagesii, the Demon of Uncontrollable Despair... your greatest rival. Perhaps... Perhaps it would be best to show you." Haisano's companion was about to wave her hand, but a firm grip upon her arm stopped her.</p><p>"Before we go anywhere... would you be so kind as to tell me... WHO THE HECK ARE YOU!" the red head snapped in obvious irritation. "I can't just go about saying 'Hey You' and stuff."</p><p>Startled, the blonde woman paused. "Ummm. I didn't introduce myself?"</p><p>"No! You were too busy pullin' that appearin' in fronta my face trick... AGAIN." Haisano growled</p><p>"Oh... Sorry." She grinned sheepishly. "I am Urd, Goddess of the Past, Second Class, Limited. Here's my card."</p><p>Haisano blinked, and accepted the offered card and glanced at it and rolled her eyes. "Uhh... Great. A Goddess." A goddess with a business card no less, she thought.</p><p>Urd's grin broadened "Yes. Just like you."</p><p>"W-WhaAT!" Haisano sputtered.</p><p>Urd pulled a gilded scroll from nowhere and began reading. "Sol Haisano, Warrior Goddess of the Sun, First Class, Unlimited. Secondary aspects of Honor and Battle. Status: 3E18012.8.23 Inactive-File Corrupted. See linked file date 3E18012, Silver Millennium, End of. 5E6982.6.12 Status Update: CLASSIFIED." Rolling the scroll back up, she handed it over to Haisano.</p><p>She stared blankly at the scroll for several minutes. "Goddess of the Sun?"</p><p>"Yup."</p><p>The floating red head looked up at Urd, and asked again. "The SUN Goddess?"</p><p>"Yes... well it was commonly called Sol then, but yes. You were the Goddess of the Sun."</p><p>"Yeah. Right." disbelief was plain to hear in her voice. "You expect me to believe that I am a goddess. But not just ANY goddess. Oh no. You say I'm the Sun Goddess." Haisano started laughing. "here and I thought that was Amaterasu Oomikami."</p><p>"I never said you still held that position, Haisano."</p><p>"Huh?" Haisano stopped laughing. "Oh... well then. Thanks for the laugh. I needed it."</p><p>"In fact, Amaterasu Oomikami is your replacement in the Japanese pantheon. She did an excellent job at assisting in the recovery from the chaos your... departure had on everything. Since then, no single God or Goddess has held that office. It is just too important to risk like that again."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Look Kiddo, we really don't have enough time for this. I may be the Goddess of the Past, but I cannot maintain the bubble forever. You need to understand. YOU are a kami," Urd stated. "You have always been a kami. But, unless you can recover more of yourself, you will not be ready to face Zetsubo. He is awake, and moments before I interrupted your little fight here, Gekido helped him find a new host. Will you allow me to show you your past, and who you face?"</p><p>"Uhhh. Look, I don't believe you. I mean, I can't be a megami for Kami's sake... err, no pun intended. Sure, the spirit of the spring is powerful and all, but it just don't make sense. How can a goddess drown? Aren't they immortal?"</p><p>"Yes, and no. Kami can die, under the correct situations. If a god or goddess exerts themselves to the point of collapse, then they are helpless. At that point, anything stronger than a common mortal can kill a them. Your fight with Saffron is a fine example. When you needed more strength, you drew upon the remains of your spirit trapped in the waters of Jusendo and Jusenkyo. After you assimilated your power, you were able to defeat him. After all, a mere demi-god is no match for a First Class Godess, even without your full strength." Urd finished smugly.</p><p>"But he came back to life! He didn't stay dead!" Haisano protested.</p><p>Urd smirked, "Exactly. Just like YOU!"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Oh!" Urd exclaimed brightly. "You may be happy to know that the springs are no longer cursed. When you reclaimed your divine spirit, you removed the source of the mana powering the springs."</p><p>"... Uhhh, that is... nice... I suppose... But..."</p><p>"Now then, lets take you to a place where you can learn of your past, shall we?" This time, Haisano did not interrupt Urd as she once again began to chant and gesture with her eyes closed.</p><p>Haisano glanced nervously down as glowing traces of symbols appeared beneath the pair of hovering women and rapidly spread to outline a sphere surrounding them. "What is goin' on ..eee...eeee..."</p><p>Ryoga dropped his raised fist as the slight form of his rival continued to breathe erratically. "Ranma?"</p><p>The girl dangling limply from his grasp still didn't respond.</p><p>"Damn you... Damn you... Why, Ranma? Why did you do it? I was so close... and you had to destroy it!" He moaned as a green aura grew about him. "I finally find a cure... and you had to destroy it... Just so you could abandon Akane."</p><p>No longer expecting a response, he shook her once more and pulled her close, so that they were practically nose to nose. "I... I will NEVER forgive you this, you honorless bastard!" He jerked his fist back, intent on striking the girl. Perhaps more pain would wake the Bakakoitsu up.</p><p>Ryoga never threw the punch, however. As much as he wanted to, it just wasn't in him to strike Ranma when he was helpless. The bastard would receive his punishment, but, by all the kami, Ryoga would not do it this way. He would get his revenge, but Ranma would be awake to know who it was who finally gave him what he deserved.</p><p>The strange marks on Ranma's face suddenly flared to life once more. Before Ryoga could react, she faded completely from his view and from his grasp at the same instant...</p><p>"ArrrrrRRRRGH! RAAANNMAAAAA!" The lost boy raged as his massive battle aura exploded about him. "Shi-Shi Hodoukan"</p><p>The massive sphere of depression laden ki rose into the air, hovered a moment, and plunged back down upon Ryoga. The resulting explosion erased the little camp from existence.</p>
