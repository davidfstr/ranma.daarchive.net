They are the property of their respective authors. Characters and situations from those series are used without their consent. This is a work of fanfiction for which I do not expect nor will accept compensation. This fiction is based upon Ranma 1/2, with strong influence from Ah! My Goddess and lesser cameos from the Sailors and possibly Tenchi.</p><p>Champions of the 'true' fiancé probably won't like my portrayal of Akane or Shampoo. Ukyo gets off a little better, but she doesn't get lucky either. As it is a work of fanfiction, I am not trying to duplicate the canon Manga or Anime characters. Expect some (or a lot) of OOC.</p><p>- Wildfire Chapter 02 -</p><p>The sound of raised voices carried over the walls to the Tendo compound. This was not an uncommon occurrence here where insanely powerful martial artists competed for the life of one Ranma Saotome. Some competed to win him over... some competed to win over him. This time, however, the center of attention was missing and had been for a month, at least physically. He was the central reason for the argument currently raging at the Tendo home.</p><p>Ranma stood atop the roof of a house a few lots over from the Tendo compound and watched with disappointment at the disaster brewing there. Although he had invited some of these people to be here at this time, he certainly had not invited either Tatewaki Kuno or Happosai. Ryoga was not to be seen, but with his direction sense and Ranma's luck, he would arrive just in time to hear part of a conversation and go ballistic over a wrong impression. Ukyo was standing near the rear gates, looking in on the loud argument between Akane, Shampoo and Kuno without participating. For once, she was not armed with her usual assortment of cooking utensils.</p><p>Genma walked up to the fight going on, pushed up his glasses and said something that upset all three of the teens. "He must have said something about me marrying Akane..." Ranma muttered. Kuno waved his bokken around and struck a pose. Movement atop the nearer house drew Ranma's attention to a small figure holding something. An echoing boom rolled across the area, almost drowning out Akane's shout.</p><p>The cry of "Ojii No BAKA!" drew Ranma's attention back to the Tendo compound, away from Sassuke, the Kuno's pet ninja.</p><p>Genma earned an all expense paid trip to the koi pond via Air Akane's Uppercut Express. Instant Panda, just add water. Kuno rushed to embrace his 'Fierce Tigress,' and joined the floating panda in the pond. That was odd, he thought. Normally she'd kick Kuno into the stratosphere.</p><p>"Well, may as well go on in, now. No sense in delaying any more," Ranma muttered as he hopped from the roof to the fence and then down to the walkway bordering the street. He waved cheerfully at a few familiar faces among the people on the street, then headed off toward the dojo. Almost as one, the people on the street blinked, and then hurried away from the area. When Ranma Saotome looked cheerful, bad things happened near the Tendo Dojo. The street cleared rapidly as the word spread. The young martial artist frowned a bit at their reaction, but shrugged and walked on anyway.</p><p>The past month had been priceless. At first, there were no fiancées, no challengers, no loons, no ancient masters, no... anyone. Although that had been dull, at least he had found the focus he needed to move on. A vacation was what he had needed. It was incredible what one could do with a bit of time and a chunk of soul searching. Once he reached Okiyama, things had really picked up. The visit to the Misaki Shrine outside Okiyama had helped in ways the solitude of the prior week had not. At least he knew now that his wasn't the only screwed up life. That young man, Tenchi, was being chased by almost as many girls as he was.</p><p>Ryoko was something else. She would likely give Herb a run for his money if they ever met. Ayeka reminded him of Akane in some ways and Xian Pu in others. She was constantly jumping to conclusions, and never listened to the other side of the story before flying off the handle. Thankfully, her aggression usually was directed at Ryoko. His conversations with little Sassami were often more helpful than most of his meditations. "That girl, he thought, "there was something about that girl that was... familiar. She felt..." Ranma shrugged. He couldn't explain, even to himself, what he sensed from the younger girl. But, there was a power in her that even Ryoko and Ayeka paled against in comparison.</p><p>Sparring with the old man had been a real eye opener. His skill was incredible. He would likely be an easy match for Happosai or Khu Lon. He had shown Ranma a few weak spots in his defense and with a few of his techniques. This was even more apparent with his initial response to Ryo-oh-ki. The Neko-ken was a major weakness against an opponent that knew about it. They had worked on correcting a few of the flaws, but the Neko-ken and a few others would have to be dealt with later. For now, he resolved to avoid conflicts as much as possible. If those flaws were exploited, not that they had been up to now, they could leave her vulnerable at a time she would need to be strong. Ranma winced at his thoughts... HE would need to be strong.</p><p>As it was, there was still a vast amount of work to be done before he felt he would be complete. He would still be working on that had he not made the promise to return no later than tonight. All the soul searching up to this point allowed him to become more at peace with himself. He had tried to do this often on the roof of the Tendo home, but there was always someone or something to distract him there. Perhaps he would take Sassami up on her offer and return when things were settled here.</p><p>One thing the time had allowed him was the chance to come to grips, finally, with his - curse. He no longer thought of it as a curse, exactly. It was more like a skill, or technique, that one must master. Although he had accepted it as a part of himself so many months ago, he had never been comfortable with it. He still wasn't comfortable with the change, but, with acceptance, the path to understanding had opened. With understanding, he was finally learning to control the change. His control was not perfected and required a constant use of ki, but a casual splash was no longer a thing to fear. Prolonged exposure or large quantities of water, such as steady rain or being thrown into a lake, were far harder to resist. On the other hand, maintaining the control helped him in other ways. Each day, the control grew easier as his ki steadily grew from constant use.</p><p>He could even change without water, although it was very hard. It left him feeling drained, as he had when he first developed that ki based attack, the Mouko Takabisha or used the Hiryu Shoten Ha for the first time. Perhaps with practice it would come easier, as they had become. As it was now, it always left her feeling like taking a nap in the sun.</p><p>By far it was easier to allow the change normally and then use the technique to lock his form in the current shape than to force the change without water. That 'lock' wasn't permanent, but a few hours of peace from worrying about changing unexpectedly were better than the alternative. He still couldn't go swimming as a guy, and anything stronger than a light shower would still trigger the change, if she was a guy. But, all things considered, this was better than being subject to the whim of every stray splash of water.</p><p>Everything was set with the Department of Records. It would require his presence and hanko to reverse the changes to the records he had requested prior to leaving. Genma no longer could control his destiny. It would likely take a bit of convincing to get it through the panda's thick skull, though.</p><p>Ranma was sick of everything. Sick of fiancées. Sick of fighting for a spoiled brat with nothing better to do than continue the vicious cycle of insults and physical abuse. But most of all, sick of being taken for granted. Things were going to change, one way or another.</p><p>The gate to the Tendo compound loomed in front of the young martial arts master. He paused at the back gate, closest to the dojo and then continued around to the front entrance. This place had been his home for almost two years, now. In fact, it was the only home he remembered thanks to the training trip. However, if things went bad tonight, and it was almost guaranteed to do so, well, best talk to her first.</p><p>He sighed and muttered, "Time to end this mess. One way, or another." Raising his hand, he pulled on the door chime. The single musical tone of the brass chime rang throughout the Tendo compound.</p><p>"I'll get it," Kasumi called from the kitchen. No sense in disturbing the - guests she thought. As the eldest Tendo headed for the entry, she looked out upon the yard between the house and the dojo. The situation had not improved after Ranma departed for his training trip. If anything, it had become worse. This was particularly true with Akane. She sighed and shook her head at her thoughts aa she proceeded down the hall.</p><p>Shortly after Ranma left, Happosai returned from wherever he had disappeared to following the wedding. Although he left Nabiki-chan and herself alone, without Ranma-kun there to distract her father's old master, Akane was bearing the majority of Happosai's 'training.' Worse, he constantly and loudly blamed her for Ranma's disappearance, saying something about delaying the proper instruction to his heir. Or, was it punishment? In any case, Happosai blamed Akane for Ranma's absence, and Akane blamed Ranma for not being there to protect her from the old master.</p><p>Kasumi approached the front door, hoping that the caller was not another uninvited suitor or challenger. She felt that would be most distressing to her home's wa. Kuno-san and Happosai had already strained the harmony of the household. Opening the door, she smiled warmly and said, "Welcome to the Tendo Residence... Oh! Ranma-kun. Please, come in!"</p><p>"Thanks, Kasumi-chan," The pigtailed young man said, his charming grin mirroring her own smile.</p><p>Blushing, Kasumi closed the door behind the young man. It had been a while since anyone had called her that. That made each time very special to her. "Why didn't you come on in, Ranma? This is your home, too."</p><p>"Well, I kinda wanted ta see you first," he explained, "and this seemed the best way."</p><p>"You wanted to see me?" She asked, then continued when he nodded, "Whatever for?"</p><p>"Ummm, how to put this. Well, ya see," he paused and scratched the back of his neck under his long ponytail. "I'm not sure how things are gonna go out there with the others. I hope it turns out ok, but," he sighed, "I just wanted to see ya before then and thank you."</p><p>"You do not need to thank me for anything Ranma-kun," Kasumi assured him with a smile.</p><p>"I, I feel like I do, Kasumi. You alone have always made me feel welcome here and like a part of a family. Without that, I'da been outta here a long time ago. Whatever does happen, I wanted ya to know, I," he paused and then blushed as he stammered,"l-love ya."</p><p>"Oh! Oh, My!" Kasumi gasped. 'He couldn't mean...' she thought. "R-Ranma," she paused, unsure of what to say to the young man. "I think it is a bit late to become your fiancée..."</p><p>"N-not l-like that!" he stammered, waving his hands quickly and blushing even more, "Like a sister! I never had a family, except for pop, and he ain't exactly the lovin type, ya know." He looked earnestly into her eyes. "I always wondered what it would be like. I'd say you've been just what I imagined an older sister would be like. So, thank you Kasumi-neechan, for everything." Ranma trailed off then and stood there nervously.</p><p>"Oh!" Kasumi smiled, and relaxed, "what a sweet thing to say Ranma-kun." Stepping up she hugged him much to his apparent shock. "Thank you, little brother." Truthfully, after that first week, she had started seeing the young man as a family member. Now, if only he and Akane would work things out between them, it could be official.</p><p>"R-Ranchan?" a voice interrupted from the hall.</p><p>Kasumi felt a frown on her face, and rapidly schooled her expression into its usual pleasant mask. She released Ranma and turned to face the young woman who had interrupted.</p><p>"Kuonji-san, why are you here today?" her 'little brother' asked in a tone unusually cold for him. She didn't recall ever hearing that tone of voice from anyone except Nabiki.</p><p>The Kuonji girl, Ukyo, paled at his words, but walked quickly up to the pair and stopped a respectful distance away. She then bowed and said, "I came - I am here to apologize for my past behavior. What I did was - wrong - and, I'm sorry. I hope that someday, you will forgive me. I - I still want to be your friend, even if I cannot be more."</p><p>Ukyo sounded sincere to Kasumi. The tears falling to the floor as she held herself in the bow helped that impression. Looking at Ranma, Kasumi watched his expression soften as he stepped up to the silently crying girl and pulled her into his arms. It appeared that he still couldn't resist a crying girl.</p><p>"Of course I forgive you, Ukyo," the young martial artist said gently. "All you had to do was ask. I'll be your friend as long as you want me to be."</p><p>The dam burst and Ukyo tears erupted fully into sobbing as she clung to Ranma. He stood there, holding her, as she cried into his shoulder. The young man looked toward Kasumi over Ukyo's head. His clear blue eyes, deep and soulful, gazed into hers as he asked, "Would you give us a few minutes, Kasumi?"</p><p>"Certainly, Ranma-kun," she replied with a small smile. "Just do not keep them waiting long. Our fathers have been most distressed since you left - as has Akane." She watched his face as it hardened into a neutral mask when she mentioned her youngest sister, but he then nodded and turned his attention back to the girl in his arms, his expression that of worry.</p><p>She turned and headed slowly back toward the kitchen, thinking about what she saw. From his expression, Ranma's feelings towards her little sister had changed. Instead of blustering nervously about the 'uncute tomboy,' he walled away what had looked like anger. This engagement was never going to work out, now. She had so hoped that the engagement would help her sister to grow up. Instead, she still acted like a little child.</p><p>"Damn that Baka. How dare he come here and try to claim me. I am not a prize to be won!" Akane growled out to no one in particular as she gazed at the floating form of Tatewaki Kuno.</p><p>"Bwip, Bweee!" P-Chan cried, agreeing with with her.</p><p>"Shampoo agree with violent girl. She no prize," the Chinese bimbo giggled before being hushed by the old crone.</p><p>"WHAT? What do you mean by that you... you... hussy?" Akane demanded angrily.</p><p>The purple haired amazon turned towards her, big eyes wide in fake innocence, "Shampoo mean what Shampoo say. Akane right. Akane not prize to be won."</p><p>"So, you think I'm not good enough to be a prize is that it?" The Tendo heir demanded. 'How dare she say that?' she thought to herself.</p><p>"So, Akane" Nabiki's voice drawled from the porch, "are you going to yell at her if she agrees with you... or if she disagrees with you?" Akane whirled and glared at her older sister. The smirk on Nabiki's face did nothing to calm her down.</p><p>"Stay outta this, Nabiki. She shouldn't even be here. Ranma is MY fiancé!" she stated.</p><p>"Great-Grandmother say Airen invite Shampoo here, so Shampoo here," the amazon warrior said smugly.</p><p>Akane glared at her and then the wizened figure perched on a rock prodding the ground with her staff. "Hmpff! So stay! See if I care. At least Ukyo knew when to leave," she growled, "unlike some people!"</p><p>"Akane..." another voice called.</p><p>She spun around once more and yelled, "WHAT!"</p><p>"G-go get some h-hot water from Kasumi, f-for Genma," Suon stammered out, nearly in tears.</p><p>"Why should I do anything for that lazy panda?" she demanded as her glare shifted focus to the dripping animal. "He is your friend. You get the water!"</p><p>"Waaaahhh! My little baby hates me!" Suon wailed as his fragile grasp over his emotions shattered easily once again. Out of habit, Genma leapt away from the Tendo Family Waterworks and landed right back in the koi pond.</p><p>Akane glared at her father for a moment longer then turned and stomped off toward the house. "Fine! I'll get the stupid water for the stupid panda."</p><p>As she neared the walk, she saw Kasumi walk around the corner from the front hall. 'What was she doing there?' Akane thought, 'Oh! Right. The door chime.' She changed direction and met her older sister in the common room.</p><p>"Father wants some hot water for the panda," she said when Kasumi looked at her inquisitively.</p><p>"Hmmm? Water for Uncle Saotome?" she asked. At Akane's nod she said, "Okay, come along." The oldest Tendo daughter led the youngest to the kitchen and picked up the kettle from the stove. "Oh, dear. I will have to heat more water."</p><p>"Whatever," Akane grumbled. "It probably won't matter to the Panda. Who was at the door, Kasumi?"</p><p>"Another - participant - in the meeting this evening," her sister replied as she filled the kettle and set it over the burner.</p><p>"Another fiancée?" Akane assumed. 'That perverted Baka. I bet that's where he has been all month,' she thought before demanding to know where this new fiance was at.</p><p>"Oh, Akane, you are so silly sometimes," Kasumi said as she giggled. "I doubt he is another fiancé."</p><p>"Oh. So then, he is another challenger," she guessed. "Is that it?"</p><p>The older Tendo paused a bit before answering, "No, I don't believe so." She then resumed the task of putting together some snacks she had interrupted to answer the door.</p><p>"So, why is HE here?" Akane demanded. Her limited patience, already strained by the idiots crowded in front of the dojo, was beginning to wear very thin. "And, WHO is he?"</p><p>"You will have to ask that of Ranma, when he starts the meeting," she replied after another thoughtful pause. "Would you hand me the napkins? Thank you, little sister."</p><p>"You just left a boy at the door?" the younger Tendo asked in amazement. "That doesn't sound like you, Kasumi."</p><p>"Hmmm?" KasumI paused what she was doing and looked at her younger sibling. "Oh, well, he is a friend of Ukyo-san. They met at the door as she was leaving, so he is talking to her right now. I told him to come on in when they are through talking."</p><p>"Who is it? Tsubasa or Konatsu?" Akane guessed, determined to get the answers from her older sister.</p><p>"Oh, neither one." Kasumi replied as the kettle started to steam slightly. "I think the water is almost ready. Would you hand me the serving tray there? Thank you."</p><p>"Well then, Who. Is. He," Akane snapped as she handed the requested tray to Kasumi.</p><p>Kasumi frowned at her younger sister for a moment. "Akane, please do not use that tone of voice with me. It is most impolite!" Kasumi scolded.</p><p>The youngest Tendo bowed her head and fought down her temper. Kasumi wasn't at fault. Ranma was. It wasn't right to yell at her for things Ranma had done. She would be sure to smack him for making Kasumi upset at her.</p><p>Kasumi finished preparing the snack tray as the kettle started to whistle. Lifting the kettle from the stove, she handed it over to Akane with a small smile. "Here you go little sister. Please take it out for Mr. Saotome. But, be careful. It is very warm."</p><p>"Ok, Kasumi. I'm sorry I snapped at you."</p><p>Kasumi's smile broadened after Akane apologized and she nodded before turning her attention back to gathering the snacks and tea for the guests.</p><p>As Akane walked back through he common room towards the back yard, she heard the sounds of sobbing coming down the hall from the front door. Along with the sobbing was a male voice, also just barely heard. Something about it was familiar. Glancing at the still steaming kettle, Akane set it down on the porch and headed toward the front door quietly. The panda could wait. She didn't like Ukyo, but if some pervert was making her cry...</p><p>As she neared the turn in the corridor, she heard the familiar voice softly speaking over Ukyo's quieting sobs. "Ukyo. Ucchan. I need you to go home for now. I - I don't want you mixed up in this anymore."</p><p>"Ok, Ranchan. But..."</p><p>RANMA! Akane's eyes narrowed as she crept closer. The familiar uncontrollable fury was not there, just a simmering anger all her own.</p><p>"I'll stop by as soon as I can." Ranma's voice replied, interrupting Ukyo's protest.</p><p>"P-Promise?" the okonomiyaki chef asked.</p><p>"Hey," the Saotome boy protested. "I may be a jackass at times..."</p><p>"HA! Try all the time, Ranma!" Akane snapped as she jumped around the corner. Sure enough, there was a red faced Ukyo standing there with Ranma pawing all over her. "I see you couldn't wait to fondle your 'Cute Fiancée,' you JERK! Why did you even bother coming back? Pervert!"</p><p>Ukyo nearly jumped into Ranma's arms when Akane burst from around the corner and yelled at them. The youngest Tendo stood there glaring at them and insulting Ranma, like usual. "Leave Ranchan alone, Akane!" Ukyo cried back at her.</p><p>"Please, Ukyo. Don't bother..." Ranma began before Akane cut him off.</p><p>"Oh, ho! I see! You two want to be alone together!" the youngest Tendo sneered. "Well, too bad!"</p><p>"Yo! Akane, calm down. That is not what's going on he..." Ranma tried again.</p><p>"I am not," Akane yelled, interrupting the Saotome youth once more, "going to let you flirt with another girl in my home!"</p><p>"I was just saying goodbye to..." the pony tailed boy replied. Ukyo was in something of a shock at this point. Ranma wasn't insulting Akane, and Akane hadn't punted Ranchan across the rooftops yet.</p><p>"I can't believe you would stand there and grope her like that," the furious teenager continued, ignoring Ranma's attempts to explain what was going on.</p><p>"You aren't listening to me, are you?" he asked. Ukyo could hear the sorrow in his voice. She looked closely at his face. For the first time, she saw what this argument was doing to him. She could see the pain in his eyes as Akane continued to accuse him of things that probably had nothing to do with what he had done over the last month.</p><p>"You run away for a month, probably sucking up to yet another fiancée..."</p><p>"Nope, you're not," he said before he turned partially back to face Ukyo, "Look, Ucchan, this is gonna be a while. Go home. Please."</p><p>"...doing who knows what kind of perverted things, and what do you do the first thing?..." Akane continued to rant, making it hard for Ukyo to hear Ranchan.</p><p>"Okay, Ranchan. You'll stop by before you leave, right?" After Ranma nodded his assent, Ukyo glared at Akane and then departed for home.</p><p>"...you hanging all over that tramp. I bet you can't wait to jump on Shampoo now that Ukyo is gone..." Akane's voice followed her out of the Tendo compound.</p><p>'That... that... OOOH!' Ukyo seethed as she stamped her foot. 'If I hadn't promised Ranchan I would stay out of this...' Gritting her teeth. Ukyo headed home, trusting that Ranma would come to see her soon.</p><p>Inside the entry to the Tendo home, Ranma listened to his 'fiancée's' tirade for a while longer as he tried to calm her down. With his failure to do so came a growing sense of frustration.</p><p>"Akane..." Ranma tried again, his face darkening with repressed anger.</p><p>"What are you waiting for?" Akane interrupted, again. "Shampoo is camped out by the dojo with her grandmother. Isn't that who you really came back for? She said you invited her here, after all!"</p><p>"That's it. I've had it," Ranma growled, took a deep breath, then brushed past the walking temper tantrum and snatched up his pack. Then, as Akane followed him, ranting the entire time, he moved down the hall toward the dojo. "What did I do to deserve this?" he muttered. Finally they exited from the house and out into the yard facing the dojo and the gathered audience.</p><p>The shouting then escalated.</p><p>"Ranma, you worthless boy..." Ok, so it was a large panda sign. Close enough to a shout.</p><p>"Airen! You marry Shampoo now, Yes?"</p><p>"OH HO HO HO HO HO! My darling Ranma-sama returns to me at last!"</p><p>Ranma jerked, and looked around nervously. 'Where had SHE come from? No, wait. She wasn't here." He shuddered at his overactive imagination.</p><p>"BweeeeeEEEE! Scroink!"</p><p>'Ryoga must be screaming RaaaaaanmAA! DIEEE!' the young martial artist mused as he spared the pig a glance.</p><p>"Waaaaahhh! At last our families will be one!"</p><p>"Saotome, you fiend! Release my Shampoo!"</p><p>Through the chaos, he walked calmly to the center of the yard, and set his pack down near the koi pond. Ignoring the pig as it began chewing on his leg, he frowned at the dazed kendoist floating insensate in the pond. Kneeling, he fished the elder Kuno sibling from the pond and propped him against the tree.</p><p>He turned to find himself face to face with a scowling Genma. "Answer me boy! Where have you been? How could you abandon your fiancée at a time like this?" he barked as he dropped an empty kettle.</p><p>"Which one of the fiancées would that be, Genma?" Ranma queried, miming Nabiki once more. He stared coldly at the sputtering man for a moment before turning to one of the few people not yelling. "Do you have an answer for me Elder?" The perfect Mandarin rolling from him startled most of the people into silence.</p><p>Answering in kind, Khu Lon stated, "Indeed I do... Son-in-Law." She watched as the young man's expression hardened before continuing. "There are only two ways I may grant your request now that a kiss of marriage has been issued. The status you seek may be gained as the husband of an Nechezu warrior. Or, in your case, as the sister of one." She smiled as Ranma smothered his growing anger and bowed briefly to her.</p><p>"Very well, Elder. You will know my decision shortly." As he straightened, he dodged a blow from an enraged Genma.</p><p>"Pay attention to me, you lazy boy!" he snarled. "Honor demands you marry Akane. You will satisfy the honor of the Saotome and Tendo clans tonight!" The elder Saotome either missed or ignored the look of utter contempt Ranma gave him as the shouting once again flooded the evening air.</p><p>"NO! I'll NEVER marry a pervert like HIM!"</p><p>"N-NAY! The g-great t-Tatewaki Kuno will not allow this!"</p><p>"Bweeee!" cried P-chan, pausing his patented angry piglet ankle chew attack long enough to protest.</p><p>"Waaaaah! At last our families will be joined."</p><p>"Airen is Shampoo's Husband!"</p><p>"FINE THEN! YOU CAN HAVE HIM!"</p><p>"Saotome you FIEND! How DARE you steal my Shampoo's affections!"</p><p>"Ohh, my darling Ranma-sama. Surely you will dump that peasant and gaijin trollop..."</p><p>Ranma shuddered again, wondering where the gymnast was hiding. He glanced around again before turning to face the gathered 'friends' and 'family'. He drew a deep breath and focused his ki and, unconsciously, some of that other power.</p><p>"SILENCE!" Ranma roared, startling everyone into momentary quiet. "I will have MY say. For the first time ever, YOU WILL LISTEN!" His aura flared a brilliant blue for a moment and wisps of mist drifted up from a suddenly frosted patch of grass. P-chan staggered away from his rival, frost coating his suddenly numb snout.</p><p>"Saotome! DihuurK!" Mousse staggered back and collapsed to the ground, his legs failing to support him as he clutched his throat. Apparently unable to speak or stand, he sat there staring furiously at Ranma.</p><p>Ranma, stood where he was before, a smirk upon his face, with one finger raised toward the myopic duck-cursed boy. Everyone else looked on in silent shock. They knew he was fast, but no one had seen him move against Mousse. Not even Khu Lon had seen the actual strike. "I said you would listen, Mu Tsu, not rant. Does anyone else choose to interrupt me?" he asked, looking around.</p><p>Most of the 'guests' stared at Ranma and then Mousse. Several heads shook silently. Mousse struggled against the pressure points, glaring at Ranma. A rustling in the bushes drew Ranma's attention. Upon investigating further, he found Kodachi. The deranged gymnast lay hog-tied behind the shrubs. A chewed through gag lay on the ground nearby. She gazed up at him feverishly and cooed, "I knew you would come to my rescue, my darling Ranma-sama."</p><p>Shuddering, he tapped the same points he had used on Mousse and released her from her bonds. Then, he carried her over to hand her off to her strangely silent brother. Ranma gazed steadily into the taller youth's eyes. For once, he saw calm respect from the kendoist. Nodding once to the older boy he looked around at his assembled 'friends' and asked, "Anyone else?"</p><p>He saw Akane looking at him with anticipation. She seemed to be waiting for something. Following her gaze, he looked at his feet and frowned. The pig had recovered from his brief brush with Ranma's icy aura and was once again attempting to bite him down to size.</p><p>"P-chan," he said. "Please stop that."</p><p>The pig ignored him and continued to chew on his ankle.</p><p>"P-chan. If you don't stop, I'll be forced to ask Kasumi to give you a hot bath."</p><p>Freezing in place, P-chan looked up at Ranma's face before darting into Akane's arms.</p><p>"Ranma!" Akane snapped.</p><p>Looking up and meeting Akane's gaze, he raised an eyebrow, silently prompting her to continue.</p><p>"Stop picking on P-chan, you jerk!" she growled.</p><p>Shaking his head slightly he responded politely, "How, exactly, did I just pick on him?"</p><p>"You were teasing him." She stated angrily.</p><p>"I see," he replied as calmly as before. "My apologies, P-chan, for teasing you." Looking back up to meet Akane's gaze, he asked, "Does that satisfy your pet's honor, Akane?"</p><p>Stunned, all Akane could do was nod her head.</p><p>"Good!" Ranma nodded, "Now, we may actually have a chance at settling some things. By the way, Mu Tsu, Kodachi-san," Ranma stated pleasantly, "the shaitsu points I used on you will wear off in a few hours. I thank you for allowing me to demonstrate their effectiveness.</p><p>"On to business then. Mister Tendo?" Suon jerked and looked toward the youth. "Do you love your youngest daughter so little, that you would force her to marry someone she clearly hates?"</p><p>Suon remained silent as his lower lip quivered and tears streamed from his eyes in rivers.</p><p>"Well? Do you?" he asked again, growing impatient with the blubbering man.</p><p>As Ranma stalked toward the Tendo patriarch, a slow motion drew his attention to the side. Khu Lon had her staff raised into the air and an amused expression on her face.</p><p>"What?" he snapped.</p><p>"Well, Son-in-Law," she drawled out, eliciting a wince from the young man. "You did demand silence." Her smile broadened into a cheerful grin as Ranma groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose with one hand.</p><p>A whispered "Baka" drew his gaze over to a red faced Akane. He glared at her a moment, then grinned and nodded at her. "Okay. I deserved that," he admitted. Turning back to the Tendo patriarch, he ignored the multiple face faults scattered about the yard and said, "Please, Mister Tendo. Answer my question."</p><p>"The schools m-must be joined. Honor must be served!" Suon sputtered.</p><p>"That wasn't my question," Ranma sighed, "But, I guess that is your answer. Love don't matter to you. Hate don't matter to you. Only the chance to 'retire' and live of your daughter's work matters at all."</p><p>The young Saotome circled the blubbering man as he spoke. "So, against everything that shows that we should not be married, you wanna force us into it anyway. Right? You want the Tendo line to be joined to the line of Genma Saotome."</p><p>"Yes!" Suon cried, his tears continued unabated. "That's it exactly! I'm so happy you finally see it, Son!"</p><p>"Yah, whatever." Ranma snorted. "Never mind the utter lack of honor with which Genma has held the promised engagement. Never mind all the other fiancées. Never mind that to unite your family with that of Genma's would bring that dishonorable fool into your family." Shaking his head, he turned to face Akane. She had P-chan clutched in a crushing grip to her chest. The pig-cursed boy glared at Ranma even as he struggled to free himself from her grip.</p><p>"Well, Akane-san? What is your wish? Do you wanna marry the son of Genma Saotome?" he asked, his face calm and his tone serious.</p><p>"No! Of course not, you jerk! There is no way I would ever want to marry a perverted freak like you!" P-chan's struggles suddenly stopped as the little pig looked at Akane with tear filled eyes. "You want to know what I want? I want you to go away and never come back!" Her pig slowly turned to glare at Ranma, a flickering green fire burned at the back of those eyes.</p><p>"Thank you for your honesty, Akane-san." Ranma said as calmly as before. Smiling at her, he called out to her sisters in the house. "Nabiki-san, Kasumi-chan. I need to ask you a question please!"</p><p>"What do you want them for, Ranma?" Akane demanded.</p><p>Ranma glanced at her and replied, "As I said, Akane, I gotta ask them something."</p><p>"I won't let you hurt my sisters, you pervert!" the Tendo heir stated, her voice dripping with venom. She clutched P-chan to her even tighter as her glare remained unabated.</p><p>"Akane," he sighed, "when have I ever done anything to harm them?" he paused, then glancing down said, "You might wanna relax a little. Your pet is starting to turn purple..."</p><p>Akane gasped and dropped to her knees to tend to her 'pet' as her sisters stepped out onto the walk overlooking the yard.</p><p>"So, Ranma," Nabiki asked, "what do you need us for?"</p><p>Ignoring the youngest Tendo, he asked the older sisters, "Do either of you think that the proposed marriage of Akane Tendo and Genma Saotome's son is a good idea?"</p><p>The two sisters looked at each other, and then shook their heads.</p><p>"Aloud please. I want this on your tape, Nabiki."</p><p>Nabiki shrugged and smirked at him. "Nope. I think it's a terrible idea. Sooner or later, one of you will kill the other. And, considering you refuse to even defend yourself from Akane - well, lets just say I don't want my little sis to become a murderer."</p><p>"Oh, My!" Kasumi looked shocked as she stood next to Nabiki.</p><p>"Kasumi?" Ranma inquired.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Do you approve of the engagement?"</p><p>"Oh..." Kasumi looked at her father, then at Akane, and finally at Ranma. "No, Ranma-kun, I do not approve. Even after all you have done for us, and for Akane in particular, it would not be right to force either of you into that situation. It would only further destroy the harmony of this family. She has not grown up enough to realize what you mean to her, and what she meant to you."</p><p>Noting the past tense in that last statement, Ranma nodded. "Thank you. Would you happen to have any hot water?"</p><p>"Of course, Ranma-kun!" Kasumi produced a steaming kettle before she and Nabiki retreated into the house.</p><p>Ranma turned to Suon and his father and set down the kettle between them. "Well. You heard 'em. What is your decision? Are you going to force this idiocy to continue?"</p><p>Genma looked from the house, to Ranma, and then Suon. He snorted. "Quit whining, Ranma. You sound like a little girl. You WILL marry Akane. There can be no other answer."</p><p>Laughing, Ranma walked back to his pack, and pulled a simple wooden bucket from within. "That has been your favorite saying all along, old man. 'Ranma, you sound like a girl.' Funny you should say that, now." Squatting down, Ranma filled the bucket with some water from the pond. As he stood he saw Khu Lon's eyes widen.</p><p>"A lot of problems around here are because I am here. Actually, it doesn't matter where I am, there are problems simply because I am." Ranma stood casually and looked toward Genma. "Last chance, old man. What's it gonna be. Will you cancel the agreement with the Tendos?"</p><p>"Foolish boy!" Genma rumbled. "You have no choice. Your feelings don't have anything to do with the engagement. It is a matter of honor. You WILL uphold the family honor!"</p><p>"So be it" Ranma stated flatly. He sighed upended the bucket over his head. He allowed the change to flow over herself and locked her form with her new technique. She gathered a ball of red-gold ki, tossed the fake Chuisuton into the evening sky, and vaporized it. A fine white ash settled over Genma. "Happy now?" she asked. "Ranma Saotome is no more. He died at Jusendo, along with the love he held for Akane." Placing her hands on her hips, she glared at the sputtering bald martial artist.</p><p>As Genma gaped at her, Ranma looked around the yard. Everyone was staring at her with a look of shock upon their face. Everyone except Elder Khu Lon. Her expression was grim as she sat upon the stone. She matched Ranma's gaze and cocked a single eyebrow at her. Genma found his voice, drawing Ranma's attention back to him.</p><p>"Ranma, do you take me for a fool? You can't hide in your curse!" Snatching up the kettle, Genma dumped its near boiling contents over the diminutive redhead. "Now stop this foolishness. You still... haven't..." Genma stood staring at the grinning girl. The kettle fell from his nerveless grasp.</p><p>"Thanks for the hot shower, Saotome-san. I really don't like the smell of the fish from the pond." Fully prepared for the scalding water, she used her new technique to prevent the hot water from burning her, and at the same time, prevented the curse from triggering. Somehow, she was able to draw off the heat and convert it into that other energy form. She still wasn't sure what it was, but there was alot of it. Now, she used that energy to dry her clothes in a flash of steam. She stepped back to her pack, smirking at the stunned Saotome elder. "But, I believe you were looking for something like this." She pulled a battered old kettle from her pack, watching Genma carefully. When she saw his eyes widen in realization of what he thought it was, she threw it up into the air.</p><p>Genma immediately leapt up and snatched it from the air. He landed facing away from his son-turned daughter. Laughing, pushing his glasses back up on his face. "HA! Too slow, boy!"</p><p>"Who are you calling slow, Mister Saotome? And in case you have not noticed, just as you always claimed, I'm a girl. I will be for a long, long time." She held up another battered old kettle and smirked.</p><p>Genma whirled in time to see the kettle she held up melt into slag in her hands.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Mister Saotome. As I said, Ranma Saotome is no more." She turned and glanced at Tatewaki Kuno. He and Kodachi were staring at her with gleaming eyes. "Yo! Tatewaki-kun! Thanks for all your help. I'm finally free from the true sorcerer, Genma Saotome, my former father. Isn't that great?" the redhead winked at him and giggled.</p><p>Ranma turned to face her 'fiancée.' Akane stood on the porch with a shocked expression on her face, and an unconscious pig in her arms. "Careful Akane, you don't want to squeeze P-chan to death. You are free from the engagement as far as I am concerned. You have your wish at last. Ranma Saotome will be gone from your life. Any chaos in your life from this point is of your own making. Not mine." She started to turn away from the shocked girl, then said over her shoulder, "Oh, By the way! Congratulations. You have defeated me twice. First, against all odds, you earned my love, and then you destroyed it. You should be proud. Not many people can claim to have defeated me."</p><p>"Elder Khu Lon..." she began, turning toward the amazon Matriarch, only to end up face to face with an enraged Genma.</p><p>"Ranma! What have you done?" he roared, shaking the copper kettle in the redhead's face.</p><p>She smirked at him and replied, "Do you not remember Prince Herb?"</p><p>"Of course I remember! What kind of son are you to turn your back on the agreement between the Saotome and Tendo families? Are you a coward to hide as a girl when the family honor is at stake? Honor demands you wed Akane!"</p><p>"Mister Saotome," she began frostily, "First, I am no longer your son, legally or physically. After tonight, the Saotome name no longer has any meaning for me."</p><p>"Wha...?" Genma sputtered. "What do you mean by that?"</p><p>"Oh, you haven't heard?" the redhead gasped in sweet voice. "Silly me. It must have slipped my weak girly mind." She giggled brightly. "Ranma is no longer a Saotome. He had himself removed from the family register."</p><p>"That's - that's not possible! You can't do that! When... How...?" Genma trailed off, then finished with, "...Why?" Ranma could see all the hopes Genma had built up begin crashing down.</p><p>"Oh, My! But it is possible, Mister Saotome," Ranma replied, her cute grin changing into a remarkable likeness of Kasumi's serene smiles. "He was old enough to make his own decisions. To answer your other questions, before he left last month, by filling out the paperwork, and because it was the only way to maintain the honor of the Tendo and Kuonji families, thanks to your own honorless activities."</p><p>Genma gaped at his son turned nameless girl. She stepped around him and approached the Amazon Matriarch who stood near the unconscious forms of the younger amazons. Before she could say anything however, Genma recovered what wits he had and grabbed the redhead from behind by her long flowing hair.</p><p>"You, you ungrateful little punk!" he snarled, "How could you do this to me after all I have suffered for you!"</p><p>Slapping a few shaitsu points to free herself from his grasp, she glared at the fat man while dodging his attempts to snare her with his other arm. "After all... YOU have suffered... for ME?" She broke into bitter laughter. "Riiight. I almost forgot... you actually have convinced yourself... all the crap... you pulled... has been for my benefit. You are as delusional as ever, Mister Saotome." She shook her head sadly before tripping him once more into the koi pond. "Multiple engagements, insanely dangerous and often idiotic training techniques, constantly selling me for food you ate, or to get yourself out of trouble, lying, theft... Need I go on old man?" The wave of displaced water washed over the immobile young Amazons.</p><p>She watched the panda drag himself from the pond. "No. I do not see how YOU have suffered at all. Whenever there was a problem you couldn't run away from - there Ranma was, a convenient bartering piece. You have done nothing for his benefit. You have suffered nothing for his benefit. Even your curse is more of a blessing to you. You use it to hide from your problems all the time. All you have done is drag the Saotome name into the dirt. What honor your branch of the clan had was destroyed long before now, Mister Saotome. You are not worthy of being Ranma's father. You are not worthy of telling me how to live my life. You are not worthy of being related to the Tendo or Kuonji clans or even to one of the Amazons."</p><p>Once more she turned to face the grim faced old woman from China. "Elder..." she began before being interrupted again.</p><p>"Sweetoo!" cried the little brown blur that buried itself in Ranma's chest.</p><p>"Gyah! Get the h - Get OFF! Get offa me ya little freak!" Ranma shrieked, her aura flaring a brilliant gold. Everyone in the yard backed quickly away from the two as the redhead shuddered under the ministrations of the ancient hentai master. She could actually feel him draining her ki and absorbing it into himself. She began bouncing around the yard, smacking him repeatedly on the head. This only had the effect of pressing him deeper into his technique.</p><p>"Ohhh!" he cooed, "My precious darlings are here to stay! Thank you, Ranma-chan! Your gift is accepted. Eh? What's this?" he finished as the redhead landed near the koi pond and stood stiffly while glaring down at him. Her ki tasted, different, stronger...</p><p>"What have you been up to, my dear?" the lecher asked looking up into the face of the girl he was fondling for the first time. His mouth dropped open in shock as he stared at the glowing visage.</p><p>Genma apparently noticed the expression as well. A memory of an event two years past flashed through his mind. The pain of the last time he saw those marks came roaring into focus. He flashed a sign, "RUN!" He flipped the sign over, showing, "He hasn't been this mad since Jusenkyo!" Genma, true to form, prepared to perform the Saotome Final Attack - Run Away maneuver.</p><p>Khu Lon fell off her rock and stared at her Son-in... at Ranma-sama in profound shock.</p><p>"I have put up with this long enough. Let go. Now." Ranma ground out in a quiet voice that nonetheless was clearly heard by all. Her face was twisted into a savage snarl. Glowing symbols appeared between and to either side of her eyes. The marks were glowing a bright crimson hue matching her aura as it began to flicker and dance like flames. Intense heat poured off of her as if the flame like aura was actual fire.</p><p>"Go - goddess!" Happosai whimpered quietly, frozen in mid grope. Shock was plainly visible on his features as he gaped up at Ranma's glowing face.</p><p>A young girl's voice cried out, "Got You!" as Ranma's danger sense flared like crazy. Spinning, she just caught the sight of black hair as the business end of a hammer slammed up into her chin, knocking her into the nighttime sky, along with a smoking Happosai.</p><p>Before anyone else could move, the small figure cried out, "OH, NO! Not again!" With that she dove back into the koi pond she had emerged from and disappeared from view.</p><p>Silence fell across the Tendo compound.</p><p>Khu Lon quietly picked up her two young charges and darted over the wall.</p><p>"What just happened, Tendo?" Signed the panda.</p><p>"Come with me Mister Saotome," Nabiki called, "and I'll list it out for you. In triplicate." She grinned as the panda-man flinched under her cold gaze.</p><p>"Awaken, my child," a male voice intruded upon the troubled dream gripping the young martial artist. She struggled against the unseen bonds that held her arms and legs. The howling coming from the pit stirred the great fear in her soul.</p><p>"Nooo, papa. I don't wanna go back in. Please, papa," she moaned. A shadowy figure held her over the seething pit of darkness. A gleaming smile spread across the dark face.</p><p>"It is time for you to embrace your destiny, child," the voice once again intruded, causing the shadowy figure to hiss as its grin wavered. A white spark illuminated the darkness below, far beyond the grasping and howling beasts waiting to tear into her tender flesh. "Come to me, my child. Come through to me. Let not these fears hold you back, and come to your destined place."</p><p>"Not the cats again, papa. Please don't throw me in there again." She begged the shadowy figure that held her. Terror began to well up within her, feeding the darkness.</p><p>Laughing, the shadow dropped the struggling girl into the darkness. A heart wrenching scream, full of fear and betrayal erupted from her. "FATHER!"</p><p>For once, the light caught her instead of the dark. The Shadow howled in impotent fury as it vanished in a burst of sickly green light. The voice soothed her fears as the gentle arms held her small figure protectively. Her wounds, healed. Her bonds, released. It promised all would be well. Guidance would appear soon.</p><p>"Awaken, my dear child. Seek out your heritage. Remember your past. You must soon embrace your destiny, and be Reborn."</p><p>- End Wildfire Chapter 02 -</p>
