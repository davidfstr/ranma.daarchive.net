</div><p>Epiphany Chapter 03<p>By Tripolar Disorder<p>Revision 4.1<p>This is an alternative universe from the Ranma timeline.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Meanwhile in Ranma's nightmare...<p>Darkness. A swirling mass of black, so dark, that no light could<br/>escape it. He was trapped within the icy cold tentacles of the<br/>darkness. It played with him, permeated him, leaving him weak<br/>and defenseless against the coming attack.<p>The cats were on him. All over him. Worse than the darkness,<br/>he felt their claws tearing away at both his flesh and his mind.<p>Ranma struggled to retain control. He could not let the cat in<br/>him take over. He tried to fight back, but the hopelessness he<br/>faced could not be overcome, and he lost.<p>With the last strength he had left, he weakly cried out for his<br/>mother.<p>A terrible crash near his feet and he thought he saw her. His<br/>mother was there and she would save him. She lifted him up out<br/>of the pit and he was feeling safe.<p>The pain of the pit subsiding, he was no longer crying, but then<br/>realized he was a she. Nodoka gasped and moved away from her.<p>No matter how fast she ran toward her mother, she kept getting<br/>further away.<p>Ranma-chan cried outward, her arms outstretched as she ran as<br/>fast as she could. She stumbled and fell, and darkness claimed<br/>her again. She curled into a ball once more, feeling her heart<br/>torn out yet again. The voice of her father echoing insults<br/>filled the air. "You sound like a girl, Ranma." "What kind of<br/>man are you?"<p>As she opened her eyes, to look into the darkness, something<br/>didn't feel right. He blinked and found himself in his room at<br/>the Tendo's. He cursed himself that it was all a dream, and that<br/>he had been weak to be frightened by it. He got up and walked<br/>over to the door, and was about to open it, when a hand was<br/>placed on his shoulder.<p>Ranma jumped and turned around to face his girl-side. She was<br/>wearing an identical silk shirt and tie leg pants. He noticed<br/>her smile. She turned her head as she followed him, as he<br/>circled her. She kept her hands behind her back, clasped<br/>loosely.<p>"Who are you!" He almost shouted at her. "You another one of<br/>those mirror clones?"<p>Her smile changed to a frown, but only for a moment. "You insult<br/>me Ranma. Don't you realize that you are still dreaming?"<p>Ranma gestured around him. "It sure looks real to me."<p>The girl nodded. "So I did a nice job huh? The least you could<br/>do, would be to compliment me on my accuracy. With a wave of her<br/>hand the walls split from the floor and he could see flowing<br/>darkness, a swirlng void that sent chills across up his spine.<br/>Just as quickly, the walls moved back into place, once again<br/>enclosing the room."<p>"Uh yeah, nice job. Just curious, who are you, and why are you<br/>in my dream?"<p>"You can call me Ranko, since we are so found of the name, and<br/>as to who I am, I am your curse. As for the why, I decided that<br/>I could no longer let you be consumed by your nightmares."<p>Ranma had a confused look. "My curse? You mean my cursed form?"<p>Ranko shook her head. "No, I am your curse. I am the magic that<br/>causes you to change into a girl. I have simply invaded your<br/>thoughts and taken this familiar form."<p>Ranko turned around and walked over toward the wall. She<br/>continued to face it as she began to explain.<p>"Ranma, magic is a funny thing. When the spirit of the springs<br/>targeted you to be cursed, it didn't look into your mind. But<br/>once you are cursed, the magic gets to know you. Created by the<br/>springs the moment you were dropped in the pool, my job is to<br/>make you a water magnet. I influence your actions to cause you<br/>to come into contact with cold water. I know everything about<br/>Jusenkyo curses and the cures. I learned about everything else<br/>from you, by looking through your mind."<p>Ranko sighed and she turned around. "I am sorry Ranma. I have<br/>seen the horrible things within your minds eye." She sighed and<br/>walked over to him. Ranko then dropped down onto her knees and<br/>gave Ranma a hug. She held it for a long time before releasing.<br/>Ranma meanwhile, had stiffened slightly before trying to comfort<br/>the girl.<p>When she parted he could see her eyes. She was beginning to cry.<br/>Ranma was genuinely curious as to what was happening. Ranko<br/>noticed this, and she sighed.<p>"I know what you are thinking. Why am I crying? I'm crying<br/>because I have done nothing but cause you more pain and<br/>suffering. You almost lost everything thanks to me, but today I<br/>have witnessed an event that has shown me a path."<p>"A way to make everything better and give you back what I took<br/>away, and I fully intend to use it."<p>Ranma looked at her, "Whddya mean?"<p>"Your thoughts are open to me at all times. I know you feel more<br/>comfortable in your female form than you let on to others. I<br/>think that some around you know this."<p>Ranma pulled away from her. He stood up and walked away from the<br/>redhead. "You're lying! I don't like being a girl. Everyone<br/>knows that."<p>Ranko stood up and walked over to him. He stepped backward upon<br/>her continuing advance.<p>"You look in the mirror and see the face of a broken man, the<br/>effect your idiot father's attempt to make you a man amoungst<br/>men. You own face is a visual reminder of all the aches and<br/>pains of old wounds. Everything you did to get your mother<br/>back."<p>"But when you look at this face in the mirror, you see a<br/>different person. You know it's you looking out, but you see<br/>this body as your chance to escape the pain. I want to give you<br/>that new life."<p>He was still looking away from her, shaking his head. "You're<br/>lying!"<p>"You are the one who's lying to themself here and there is no<br/>need. It only makes your problems worse. Genma and Soun aren't<br/>around to fill your head with nonsense. Your mother is happy<br/>having you as a girl."<p>Ranma gave her a suspicious glare. "You don't know that."<p>Ranko shook her head. "I do too, and so would you if you stopped<br/>and felt outside your body for a moment. She's out there holding<br/>you and trying to make your nightmare fade. She heard you cry<br/>out for her and she came running. She took the door off it's<br/>track."<p>Ranma was still backpedaling, until he hit the wall. "But, but,<br/>but,..."<p>"Ranma, I did not come here to convince you that you should be a<br/>girl. I came here because I wanted to offer you the choice. I<br/>want you to be truly happy and this is the only way that I can do<br/>it. Then you can make your own mind, and no one will have a say<br/>in it but you."<p>Ranma braced himself against the wall. "What are you going to<br/>do to me?"<p>Ranko smiled again. "You have accepted the curse Ranma, wheither<br/>you admit it or not. I know the truth and so do you. I will<br/>surrender my power to you, and you can discover your own<br/>feelings for yourself."<p>With that she threw herself at him. Ranko wrapped her arms<br/>around his torso, and squeezed. Ranma was stunned, but he felt<br/>the urge to return the embrace, and did so. Suddenly there was a<br/>bright blue glow around them. Ranma closed his eyes as the light<br/>was immensly bright. Ranma could feel a new source of power<br/>engulf him. He could feel it flowing through his veins and<br/>giving him strength. It felt strange, like softness and warmth,<br/>and it calmed him. When it faded Ranma found that he was<br/>standing in the middle of the room again, and that he was a she.<p>She looked around franticly. Ranko was nowhere to be found.<br/>Ranma-chan even called out to the emptiness, "Is this some kind<br/>of a joke?"<p>She was about to scream, when a soft voice echoed against the<br/>wall. Ranma-chan turned to see Ranko sliding in through the<br/>wall like a ghost. "Oops, I got thrown off you there. I<br/>couldn't quite handle the energy output. Sorry about that."<p>"So what did you do?" Asked a frustrated Onna-Ranma.<p>"Welcome to the first day of your new life. I promise to help<br/>make it better than your old one."<p>And with that, the room faded into darkness and Ranma-chan opened<br/>her eyes.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Meanwhile...<p>Nodoka had carried the sleeping girl downstairs, laying her on<br/>the couch. She had then gone in to help Kasumi with breakfast.<p>She returned to look upon Ranma-chan, who was still asleep and<br/>murmuring softly.<p>Nodoka was about to wake her, when she noticed Ranma-chan's face<br/>contorting and a dark blue aura formed around her.<p>Nodoka took a step back as the aura became larger and encompassed<br/>more area.<p>As she continued to watch, the aura began to brighten. Marbled<br/>clouds of bright red flowed across it until it settled on a<br/>violet hue. Then it faded away.<p>She was concerned about what she just saw and was moving closer<br/>when Ranma-chan's eyes opened. She yawned and sat up.<p>"Oh man, what a dream." as she scratched the back of her head.<p>Nodoka came over and hugged her. "How are you feeling dear?"<p>Ranma-chan smiled, and returned the hug. She looked around at<br/>the living room. "How did I end up here?"<p>"I carried you down here. I saw you having a nightmare last<br/>night and I heard you crying out my name, so I ran in to save<br/>you, but I couldn't seem to wake you up."<p>Ranma-chan hung her head, leaning against Nodoka's shoulder.<br/>"I'm sorry you had to see that." Inwardly she was thinking,<br/>(Ranko was right. She did hold me all night. Maybe she does<br/>love me.)<p>Nodoka frowned. "I hope that you can tell me that the Neko-Ken<br/>was the worst of the training that your father put you through.<br/>I do not want you to withhold anything like that from me ever<br/>again."<p>Ranma-chan nodded, and Nodoka gave her another hug. She didn't<br/>let go, but just held on.<p>Kasumi interrupted them by exiting the kitchen with food,<br/>signaling the start of breakfast.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Breakfast went rather uneventful. A few minutes after breakfast<br/>however, Ukyo showed up.<p>Ukyo had been worried about Ranma since he was not at school.<br/>She had also seen Shampoo, who had told her that Ranma's mother<br/>was at the Dojo and Ranma was very happy, dispite his father's<br/>death.<p>At the current moment however, Ranma-chan and Akane were becoming<br/>ill at the sheer volume of sucking up that Ukyo was doing.<p>Seventeen Okonomiaki all decorated with Kanji "Welcome Mama<br/>Saotome" were sitting on every available horizontal space,<br/>including the floor.<p>Then there was the flowers. Ukyo had stopped by a florist along<br/>the way. Several large vases stood in the entryway, since they<br/>could not be taken in any further. A multitude of colors spilled<br/>out from them.<p>Nabiki was standing there with a calculator trying to determine<br/>the worth of the whole mess just for her own personal amusement.<p>Ukyo was calmly sipping tea next to Nodoka and Kasumi.<p>"It is nice to meet you Mrs. Saotome." Ukyo was talking in her<br/>'cute as a button' voice.<p>"The pleasure is mine. I appreciate it when people knock and not<br/>just invite themselves in."<p>Ukyo smiled.(Well... ) she thought to herself (...at least I made<br/>a better impression than that chinese bitch.)<p>Ranma-chan shook her head, looking around at everything. "I<br/>can't stand to be in the room with all the sucking up going on."<br/>And she left to take a bath.<p>Ukyo and Nodoka were discussing the events that led to her being<br/>engaged to Ranma, the stealing of the Yati cart and her sworn<br/>revenge, when everyone's thoughts were interrupted by a scream.<br/>Ranma-chan's scream.<p>Akane and Kasumi were the first to action. Ukyo and Nodoka<br/>followed in close behind. Ukyo noticed that the Saotome<br/>matriarch's sword was already out, so she got her battle spatula<br/>to the ready.<p>What the group found in the furo was a crying redhead. Naked,<br/>but all alone. She was curled up, her knees up at her chest.<br/>Shaking, and her head just above the water.<p>As Akane burst through the door she was in battle stance.<br/>She and Ukyo did a sweep of the room and found no signs of any<br/>intruders. Kasumi and Nodoka grabbed Ranma-chan and pulled her<br/>from the water, wrapping a towel around her.<p>As everyone was trying to figure out what happened, there was a<br/>familiar "Oh my" from Kasumi before she plunged her hand back in<br/>the water.<p>"What is it Kasumi?"<p>Kasumi stood up. Her face turned pale, and she pointed toward<br/>Ranma-chan. "The water is hot!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Cologne was busy in the kitchen at the Nekohanten. She was<br/>adding several rather strange looking herbs to what looked to be<br/>Italian pasta sauce.<p>She stopped a moment. She felt the aura of Ranma, as if he was<br/>just outside the kitchen and was, less then happy. She hopped<br/>out to find the dining area empty, but the aura was getting<br/>stronger. It was coming from near the front door.<p>Cologne became pale. She had never witnessed such a focused rage<br/>from Ranma before, and the worst part is that it was clearly<br/>directed at her.<p>She suddenly felt it spike, and she dove under a table.<p>A circular section of the front exterior wall exploded inward.<br/>Flying debris caused a dust cloud that cut visibility to nothing.<p>When the dust settled she saw Ranma-chan standing in a slumped<br/>over, staggered stance in the middle of a ten foot diameter hole<br/>in the wall.<p>Cologne hopped up on her stick. Trying to hide her fear of the<br/>immense aura surrounding the girl, She calmly asked.<p>"Hello Son-in-Law. What can I do for you?"<p>No sooner than the words came out of her mouth, then she was hit,<br/>and slammed into the wall. The image of Ranma-chan vanished from<br/>the hole in the wall.<p>Cologne was amazed, that she could move with such speed to fool<br/>her own eyes. Ranma's aura was so large at the moment that it<br/>was almost impossible to determine where the girl was.<p>As she tried to move away from the wall, she felt the air near<br/>her ripple, and was forcefully slammed against the wall again.<p>(Son in law is just playing with me. The boy could easily beat<br/>me or kill me at this point, but he isn't. Thank goodness for<br/>his ethics.)<p>Nodoka looked about the room, and saw Cologne leaning against the<br/>wall. She pointed toward the Amazon. "Ranma is not very happy<br/>with you. I myself have no interest in your well being, so I<br/>suggest you put forth the remedy to whatever you have done to my<br/>son."<p>Cologne paused a moment, her mind in deep thought. She could not<br/>come up with an answer and so she spoke. "I am sorry to sound<br/>naive, but what are you talking about?"<p>That was when she finally noticed Ranma-chan. Just a few feet<br/>away with with teeth clenched and settled into a crouched, ready<br/>stance.<p>Ranma snorted out of her nostrils, and Cologne swore she saw<br/>smoke. "All right old mummy, Unlock my curse."<p>"Indeed, please produce the cure. It has been hard on us already<br/>with Genma's death." Nodoka had stepped up behind Ranma-chan and<br/>put her hands on the shaking girl's shoulders.<p>Cologne was already thinking. She mentally listed all the ways<br/>that one would use to lock a person into cursed form. But each<br/>time, it was denied, for she neither had the method, nor a cure.<p>Finally Cologne bowed head. "I swear on the name of my tribe<br/>that I have done nothing. Please believe me. If you have been<br/>locked into your cursed form Son-..., Ranma, then let me see if<br/>I can figure what has done it?"<p>Ranma stood there glaring into Cologne's eyes. She felt the<br/>girl's piercing gaze, and her aura pushing against her. Then it<br/>ended.<p>Ranma visibly calmed. She turned toward Nodoka. "Mom, she is<br/>telling the truth. She has never lied to me before on something<br/>this important, and I believe she is telling the truth now."<p>Cologne picked up her staff. She looked around the cafe. The<br/>hole in the wall, several broken and shattered tables were<br/>composing a pile of debris that was all created by Ranma in the<br/>span of just a few seconds without touching anything.<p>She stretched out her chi, cautiously, trying to feel out the<br/>girl. She could feel the strain Ranma was having holding her<br/>temper in check. Her aura was shifting around, as if in pieces,<br/>barely holding itself together.<p>(Ranma-chan was having a mental breakdown. Her actions were more<br/>violent and less planned.) Then she remembered what Nodoka had<br/>said. (Ranma's idiot father was dead. So now he will no longer<br/>stand in the way. But the stress of his death, and Ranma somehow<br/>getting locked into cursed form was too much.)<p>She hopped over to the pair and looked Ranma-chan over. "You<br/>used a great deal of energy there Ranma. It would be best if you<br/>get some sleep." And with that, Cologne quickly tapped a spot on<br/>Ranma-chan's forehead and the girl collapsed to the floor,<br/>asleep.<p>Nodoka swept the redhead into her arms, glaring at Cologne.<br/>"What did you just do to her?"<p>"I put her to sleep for her own good. Whatever has happened to<br/>her is not helping her. I sensed a problem with her conscience<br/>thought patterns. If she sleeps, we will have an easier time<br/>determining what happened."<p>Cologne instructed her to carry Ranma-chan upstairs where she was<br/>laid out on Shampoo's bedroll. She took great care in placing<br/>the pillow under the girl's head.<p>Cologne then left the room and returned moments later with<br/>several boxes. As she opened each box they appeared to hold<br/>jewelry, but with the way the old woman handled them they were<br/>much more than pretty gems.<p>Cologne dangled several of them over Ranma-chan, swinging them<br/>back and forth in small arcs. Each time Nodoka noticed a look<br/>of disappointment, followed by the gems being tossed back into a<br/>box and another taking it's place.<p>Meanwhile Shampoo had returned and curious as to why her arien<br/>was sleeping in her room. She was shushed and so stood in the<br/>corner and watched.<p>After a minute Cologne looked up, and held a clear blue sphere<br/>out to Shampoo. "Take this child and hold it so that we can both<br/>see it."<p>Shampoo did as she was instructed. In her hands the sphere<br/>instantly clouded over until it was a smoky black in color.<p>Nodoka was amazed at the transformation. "What is that?" She<br/>asked.<p>Cologne took back the sphere and it changed back to it's original<br/>clear blue color.<p>"This gems detects the presence of water sprite magic. When in<br/>contact with anyone effected by magic of a water based origin it<br/>changes like you just saw. Shampoo also has a Jusenkyo curse.<br/>But look here."<p>Cologne placed it in Ranma-chan's hand and it did nothing. "As I<br/>thought. Ranma is longer cursed." She took the gem and put it<br/>back in it's box.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-chan was standing in the room in her mind again. She was<br/>frantically looking around when Ranko phased in through the wall<br/>opposite her.<p>"Finally, I've been trying to tell you, but you were so cought up<br/>in emotions you couldn't hear me."<p>"I have been trying to tell you that you're not locked. I told<br/>you I wanted to give you the choice."<p>She nearly dived forward as Ranma-chan feel to her knees. She<br/>took the girl into her arms. "Shhh, you're alright. You'll be<br/>okay."<p>Ranma-chan buried her face into Ranko's shoulder. Ranko<br/>comforted her, by stroking the crying girl's hair. After a few<br/>minutes, Ranma finally seemed to calm down. "Please change me<br/>back, please..." she mumbled into Ranko's shoulder."<p>"I'm sorry, I should have explained myself a little better. You<br/>can't ever be locked into one form or another anymore. No one<br/>can hurt you like that ever again. I promise. You control your<br/>curse now, not water, and not anyone else. No magical artifacts<br/>or other craziness."<p>Ranma-chan quickly pulled back, her face a mix of surprise and<br/>excitement as she looked into her twin's eyes. "So, I change<br/>when I want? No more splashing?"<p>Ranko nodded. "Just focus and think about being a man, and you<br/>can do it... well, when Cologne wakes you up that is."<p>Ranma-chan hugged her fiercly. "Thank ... you."<p>Ranko hugged her back. "Anytime you need someone to talk to,<br/>just think to me, cause I'm not going to hide. We can talk to<br/>each other whenever, and if you need me, I'll be here."<p>Ranko then looked up, "Oops, time to wake up. You better get<br/>going, and remember, I'm here for you."<p>Ranma-chan smiled and stood up. She smiled. "Thank you Ranko<br/>for the cure and for being my friend."<p>As Ranma-chan faded out, Ranko smiled back, and spoke outloud,<br/>knowing no one could hear her. "You need a real friend Ranma,<br/>and I intend to be the first."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"HI YAAA! If arien no longer cursed, then why is arien still<br/>girl-type?" Shampoo was giving Cologne a quizzical Dog-head<br/>tilt.<p>"I would like the answer myself child."<p>Cologne turned toward Nodoka, paused for several seconds trying<br/>to decide how to tactfully question her, then spoke.<p>"I would like to explain what happened to Ranma, but there are<br/>only a handful of ways this could have happened, none of which I<br/>have ever witnessed. Tell me, did you see anything strange<br/>happen to Ranma lately?"<p>Nodoka's eyes bounced back and forth, she appeared to be involved<br/>in mental deliberate. Finally she said... "Define Strange. I<br/>have seen my son change into a girl, a strange glowing ball of<br/>light surrounding her while she slept, and..."<p>She was interrupted by Cologne, "What do you mean by glowing ball<br/>of light?"<p>Nodoka sighed. She explained what she had seen earlier that<br/>morning, before Ranma woke.<p>Cologne pondered this for several moments before giving up. She<br/>turned away from Nodoka, to face Ranma. "I'm sorry, I don't know<br/>what happened and I don't know what that was. Whatever it was,<br/>it must have removed the curse magic from Ranma. She is for all<br/>intensive purposes, a normal, healthy young woman."<p>She turned back to Nodoka. "I do not have any remedy for this.<br/>Ranma is now a girl for the rest of her life. Whatever has done<br/>this is beyond any magic my tribe has witnessed in the many<br/>centuries we have lived near the springs."<p>Cologned sighed. "Please forgive my previous actions. In my<br/>attempts to get my granddaughter Shampoo married to Ranma, I have<br/>used methods which may have strained your daughter's fragile hold<br/>on her self-image."<p>"Downstairs, Ranma seemed no longer stable and being trapped as a<br/>girl may remove whatever holds her sanity together. I'm afraid<br/>of what she may do when I wake her up. I can surmise that she<br/>will be either forcefully angry, or fall into a state of<br/>depression and apathy."<p>Shampoo thought to herself. (Just what she needs, I'm betting on<br/>the latter, but the hole in the front wall was impressive. I<br/>hope that we can calm her down either way.)<p>Nodoka hung her head. "It will be alright. I will do anything<br/>to make her happy now. Please wake her. She needs to hear the<br/>truth."<p>Cologne picked up her staff and tapped Ranma-chan on the forehead<br/>again. The redhead's eyes snapped open. She sat up slowly.<br/>"Forgive me for putting you to sleep like that Ranma, you felt<br/>ill and I wanted to give you some rest."<p>Ranma-chan nodded. "I understand, I'm sorry for losing it."<p>Nodoka pulled her daughter into her arms. In turn Onna-Ranma<br/>closed her eyes and leaned against her mother. Nodoka decided to<br/>break the news.<p>"Ranma, Cologne says she cannot figure out why you don't change<br/>anymore. The magic within you seems to have gone."<p>There was a long pause they waited for a response. Ranma's face<br/>was unreadable. Her eyes remained closed and her breathing<br/>continued slow and gentle.<p>Finally, she replied. "Momma, ... if I was a girl forever, would<br/>you still love me?"<p>Nodoka had tears in her eyes. "Of course dear. Nothing could<br/>ever change how I feel about you. I finally have you back and I<br/>promise not to let you get hurt again."<p>Ranma was still calm. "Many times after I got cursed, I had<br/>nightmares like this, but in them you never accepted me. I never<br/>dreamed you would say that. Pops made me think that you wouldn't<br/>love me anymore, and because of him I was afraid to go home. I<br/>was ready to kill myself..." She wiped a tear from her eye.<br/>"... but I always wished you would accept me."<p>She leaned back against her mother and closed her eys. Where<br/>everyone was expecting a tense moment, there had been none,<br/>however the few moments of silence were broken by light sobbing<br/>as her situation's full impact must have finally struck her and<br/>increased in intensity until Ranma was bawling outright, her face<br/>buried in her mother's shoulder once more.<p>Cologne looked almost shocked. She was having trouble believing<br/>that the great fighter that she had envisioned Ranma to be was<br/>crying her eyes out. In all her dealings with the boy, she<br/>thought him to be the pillar of emotional strength, when in fact<br/>it was all an act. The last hour or so, her eyes had opened to<br/>the truth. All the clues were right in front of her face, and<br/>she had ignored them. Shampoo told of all the time Ranma spent<br/>under the bridge, all alone. She also recalled in her mind the<br/>days of the chestbut fist training, and how Ranma acted back<br/>then. Now being locked forever, with no cure, would finally<br/>break the child's frail psyche.<p>She noticed Nodoka now holding the role of strength. Gently<br/>comforting her child, her abused and neglected offspring who's<br/>difficult life had finally taken it's toll and her defenses had<br/>broken down for the last time.<p>Cologne suddenly felt a bit of remorse for everything she had<br/>done, and in a moment of personal weakness, she added her tiny<br/>arms to the embrace.<p>Ranma and Nodoka both felt the slight chill when Cologne stepped<br/>in. Ranma looked at Cologne, "Does this mean that Shampoo has to<br/>start hunting me down again?"<p>Cologne shook her head, much to onno-Ranma's relief. "No child.<br/>The kiss of death was removed long ago. And I remove the kiss of<br/>marriage as of now. You don't have to worry about anyone from<br/>our village attacking you anymore. I will personally punish<br/>anyone from my village who attacks you from now on."<p>"Even though I can stil turn into a guy huh? You are freeing me<br/>from all those obligations. Now maybe I can just find a way to<br/>get Ukyo and Akane off my back and I can be a normal teenager."<p>Heads fell downward. All believed Ranma had shut out of her mind<br/>what her mother had said. Nodoka pulled her daughter in even<br/>tighter. "I'm sorry hon, but Cologne says you can't change back<br/>anymore. You will be my daughter from now on."<p>Still smiling toward Cologne, Ranma replied. "Ahh, but the magic<br/>is not gone."<p>Cologne shook her head. Ranma-chan turned toward Shampoo and<br/>smiled. "You'll flip when you see this!" She giggled.<p>Ranma-chan closed her eyes. She imagined herself changing. At<br/>the same time she felt the power within her grow until it came<br/>from every fiber of her being. Then it faded just as easily.<br/>She opened her eyes and she was a he again.<p>Shampoo was staring with wide eyes. No water, no nothing. Ranma<br/>just changed at will. She couldn't believe it.<p>Nodoka looked at her son. "Is that supposed to happen? I'm not<br/>too familiar with your curse."<p>Ranma shifted forms again, smiling. "It does now."<p>Cologne's face was currently planted into the floor.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>End of Chapter 3<p>New day, new revision, and new plot to rewrite.</p>
