</div><p>Epiphany Chapter 5<p>By Tripolar Disorder</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane was currently in class, trying her best to concentrate on<br/>the teacher while the empty desk beside her pulled her gaze away.<p>Ranma had bowed out of school again, only returning once after<br/>their father's deaths. Instead her fiancee was spending another<br/>day as Nodoka's assistant.<p>Nodoka was usually gone for most of the day, returning only in<br/>the evening. This left Kasumi, Nabiki and herself home. It had<br/>been quiet with the lack of all the usual trouble that seemed to<br/>follow Ranma around.<p>Akane was becoming concerned. Ranma was spending more and more<br/>time as a girl, and thanks to some of professional assistants she<br/>was now in contact with, she was starting to look and act more<br/>feminine.<p>The first night, Ranma-chan had returned with an impressive tan,<br/>the lines made it clear what gender she had gone to the beach as<br/>that day. Nodoka had excused her from school to prevent any<br/>teasing, leaving Ranma to spend another day with her mother, as<br/>she continued her work.<p>The day after going to back to school, Ranma insisted on going<br/>with Nodoka again. Her mother had a hard time saying no, and<br/>when they returned that night, Ranma was sporting red hair to her<br/>waist that had been styled and loosely curled. She was also<br/>wearing a halter top and demin shorts. She wasn't upset like<br/>most times she had been relegated into female attire. It seemed<br/>her mother had a powerful effect on her personality.<p>Akane was casually pondering what she might come back as, when<br/>she was interrupted by the teacher, once again returning her<br/>attention where it should have been.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane and Nabiki returned home from school, finding Kasumi and<br/>Nodoka looking at photos.<p>Nabiki lifted one of the table, staring at it intently. "How did<br/>you get Ranma into a bikini?" She then craned her neck to look<br/>down at the others. "... or dominatrix leathers, or party<br/>dresses... or Swiss Leaderhosen?"<p>Nodoka chuckled softly. "I had a little help. Some of my<br/>clients are as interested in helping Ranma get into their field<br/>as they are furthering their own careers. Atsuko thinks Ranma is<br/>the sweetest, brightest.."<p>"... most gullible girl she ever met." Interrupted Onna-Ranma as<br/>she walked in from the kitchen, wearing tight bicycle shorts and<br/>a thong leotard. "I think tomorrow, she's going to convince me<br/>that I need a shot in a wedding dress." She went to remove the<br/>material from her behind, but sighed as she knew how futile it<br/>was.<p>Kasumi smiled. "We're trying to decide on some pictures for<br/>Ranma's portfolio. Nodoka thinks that she could make a little<br/>money posing for ads or commercials."<p>Akane calmly turned and left the room, unnoticed by the room.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-chan was on her way to the bath, when she noticed Akane's<br/>clothes in the bin next to the Furo door. She quietly knocked on<br/>the door. "Uhm, Akane. Are you in there?"<p>The door slid open, and Akane was wrapped in a towel. "I'm<br/>finished now, thanks for not just walking in, though I guess it<br/>would almost be okay now." She remarked idly as she passed by<br/>the smaller girl.<p>"Whaddya mean?" Asked Ranma, confused.<p>"Well, you being a girl now and everything. I don't have to be<br/>your uncute fiancee anymore." Said Akane, as she gathered up her<br/>clothes. "At least you acting more like a normal female and not<br/>your insane antics. You are almost tolerable now."<p>Ranma didn't say anything. Her gaze was still facing forward and<br/>Akane, who was now well behind her at the outer door, could not<br/>see her face.<p>Akane waited for some hotheaded reaction, then shrugged her<br/>shoulders and left, shutting the door behind her.<p>She passed Kasumi walking down the hall. "Ranma's in the furo,<br/>sis. She's acting a little quiet after we talked about her being<br/>a girl now and all."<p>Kasumi polietly smiled until Akane was out of sight, before she<br/>dashed toward the furo door, and slipped inside barely making the<br/>door squeak.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Several hours later Kasumi came down from her room. She walked<br/>into the dining room where Nodoka was still looking through<br/>pictures.<p>"Auntie, Can we go for a walk. We need to talk."<p>Nodoka scanned the girl's features. It was clear that whatever<br/>was troubling her was important.<p>"Of course Kasumi, lets leave now."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi was walking beside Nodoka for several blocks before she<br/>began to speak.<p>"Auntie, there is one thing that I did not tell you about Ranma,<br/>that I thought I would never have to explain."<p>Nodoka's features darkened considerably. "What is it Kasumi?"<p>"The day you found out about Ranma's curse. Do you remember that<br/>day?"<p>Nodoka nodded.<p>"Before you recognized Ranma, you tried to comfort her. Do you<br/>remember how she reacted. I had seen him that way before. Many<br/>times in fact. That was not the first, and it was not the last."<p>Nodoka stopped. "What do you mean Kasumi? I have not seen Ranma<br/>in such a state since... Wait, what about that?"<p>Kasumi faced downward. "He did it again today. I think there is<br/>someone we need to see."<p>Nodoka found that Kasumi had led her to Dr. Tofu's clinic. They<br/>went inside and found the doctor hard at work at his secretaries'<br/>desk reading a clinic report on bone regeneration.<p>"Ahem, Doctor."<p>He sprang to attention, and seeing his favorite female he started<br/>acting a little goofy. his glasses fogged over and jumped up,<br/>taking the hand of betty, his skeleton, kissing it like a<br/>europian gentleman.<p>"Onno-dear we don't have time for that right now."<p>His glasses cleared instantly, and his pulse rate returned to<br/>normal. He realized what he was doing, sighed, then turned<br/>toward his guests.<p>"I am sorry to bother you so late, but I have brought someone you<br/>might want to meet. Ranma's Mother."<p>Tofu bowed. "To what do I owe this pleasure?"<p>Kasumi stated flatly. "Ranma had another attack tonight."<p>Tofu became very serious, he ushered both women into his office,<br/>then locked the front office doors and took down the open sign.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"How long has it been since Ranma's last attack Kasumi?" Said<br/>the doctor, his elbows resting on his desk and his hands clasped<br/>in front of his face.<p>"The day that Nodoka, Ranma's Mother, found out. She confronted<br/>me as to Ranma's whereabouts not knowing that he was in the room<br/>at the time. She..."<p>Nodoka interrupted. "I hate to interrupt Kasumi, but that was<br/>not the last time. The day Cologne admitted to adding instant<br/>Girl-spring water to the furo, there was an instance where Ranma<br/>thought she was being attacked, only to realize she made a<br/>mistake and curled up into a ball and became this zombie-like<br/>husk. Her eyes looked hollow."<p>Tofu pushed up his glasses while still looking down at his desk.<br/>"How long did it take Ranma to return to conscienceness?"<p>"Only a minute or two and she apoligized afterward. What is<br/>happening to her doctor?<p>Tofu did not respond, instead he questioned Nodoka. "What about<br/>the night you found out about Ranma? How did Ranma react?"<p>Kasumi sighed. "Nodoka tried to comfort Ranma, and it had a<br/>negative effect. I would have thought she would have have jumped<br/>into her mother's arms, but instead she tried to get away. She<br/>later told me that it was because she thought if Nodoka knew the<br/>truth, she would hate her."<p>"Ranma couldn't cope with the attention. She cried out and<br/>pulled away from Nodoka and came for my protection."<p>"Then what happened?" Asked Tofu, intrigued by what he was<br/>hearing.<p>"I confronted Kasumi about my son's location, hoping Genma had<br/>told them as to where Ranma was buried."<p>Tofu asked, a confused look on his face. "Buried, as in dead?"<p>Nodoka nodded. "I assumed that Genma had accidently killed Ranma<br/>years ago and was hiding the truth from me."<p>"Kasumi informed me as to Ranma's state of health, but said that<br/>he was not ready to meet me because of circumstances that would<br/>unfulfil a contract made before they left."<p>Tofu nodded. "The seppaku pledge. I'm aware of it."<p>Nodoka was surprised. "He told you?"<p>Tofu nodded. "I will explain, but first I would like to hear the<br/>rest of the events of that day."<p>There were several moments of silence before Nodoka continued.<br/>"When Kasumi told me this, I nearly screamed at her that wouldn't<br/>ever acknoledge that that damned thing even existed. I just<br/>wanted Ranma back."<p>"I then noticed Ranko's eyes and I knew. I recognized my baby in<br/>Kasumi's arms despite her curse. Frightened, scared, and pained<br/>in a way I will never forget. Those two eyes have haunted my<br/>dreams since the day Genma took him away from me. I knew those<br/>tear-filled blue orbs staring back at me..."<p>"I knew I was needed. I also realized why she had been lying in<br/>the first place, why she was always so happy to see me, and why<br/>she couldn't let me near her."<p>Kasumi gasped slightly. "So that's how you regonized him."<p>Tofu interrupted. "Was there a change in Ranma's behavior?"<p>Kasumi nodded. "Almost instantly. Ranma came to long enough to<br/>nearly lept from me into Nodoka's embrace. She didn't let go for<br/>a long time, crying into her mother's shoulder."<p>"When they finally broke apart. Ranma-chan was almost smiling<br/>through tears.<p>"I see." Said the Doctor. "And what about tonight?"<p>"Akane said something in the furo, though she didn't realize it's<br/>affect again. Instead of shouting back at her, Ranma had just<br/>shut down."<p>"How long did it take?" He asked.<p>"About two hours." Answered Kasumi.<p>Nodoka at this was confused. "What is wrong with my son?"<p>Tofu laid his hands flat on desk.<p>"Ranma suffers from anxiety attacks. They are directly related<br/>to a history of abuse and neglect in his childhood. He will go<br/>into a state of shock for long periods and remain only semi-aware<br/>of his surroundings. They are serious fits of depression, but<br/>not unlike other known cases. The way they effect Ranma is more<br/>rare. His attacks are so dibilitating that usually only physical<br/>trauma or emotional care will bring him out of it."<p>"You can thank his father for the former. His fighting reflexes<br/>kick in far too fast and too strongly for him to think about what<br/>bothered him until later. I suspect Genma had much to do with<br/>that. Ranma would suffer an attack on the road and Genma would<br/>start beating on him to wake him up."<p>Nodoka and Kasumi both winced at his comment.<p>"What can be done about this doctor?" Asked Nodoka.<p>"I don't have an answer for this, Saotome-san." replied Tofu.<br/>"Kasumi and I have searched for a solution in books and with<br/>colleuges. They all respond similarly."<p>"Severe childhood emotional trauma is nearly impossible to<br/>correct, especially coupled on the abuse incurred as a result.<br/>Proper treatment of it's effects is the best answer. Ranma will<br/>likely suffer from depression the rest of his life."<p>"When he was young he thought you hated him. He thought you sent<br/>him away to let Genma beat on him. That and a less than loving<br/>treatment left a lasting impact on Ranma. He hardly understands<br/>love as an emotional concept, not to mention trust, and lashes<br/>out at nearly everything, using only his experiences to guide<br/>him."<p>"He believes that everyone hates him, well except Kasumi and I.<br/>We spoke about you in detail, and he thought that you would hate<br/>him too. He told me about the contract and that being a girl<br/>only made it impossible to go home. Every time he talked about<br/>you he would start shivering, a sign of his body unable to handle<br/>any more of the stress."<p>Nodoka sat listening to Tofu's entire explanation before she<br/>began to speak. "I think I understand. What can I do to help<br/>her through this?"<p>Kasumi decided to interject. "Auntie. Ranma's years of training<br/>were more like torture for him. All he knows is pain and<br/>suffering. As he got older, tormenting Genma was his biggest<br/>enjoyment. Anything he could do to get back at his father, he<br/>exploited."<p>"The curse angered Genma more than it does Ranma. Ranma often<br/>paraded around in girl's clothing and acted girlish just to annoy<br/>him. In a way, Ranma accepted his cursed form, because it gave<br/>him an advantage."<p>Tofu nodded. "Ranma's trust issue is also very severe. He<br/>rarely will believe anything a person tells him, no matter how<br/>sincere. For him, actions are the only thing he accepts. I<br/>suspect that he has asked you repeatedly if you really love him,<br/>like he needs a daily reasurance."<p>Kasumi and Nodoka both nodded.<p>Kasumi decided to add a final observation. "A few months ago I<br/>found her in the furo, huddled in the corner. SHE had run home<br/>from school because she didn't want others to see her emotional<br/>state. She had been teased about being a girl and she couldn't<br/>take it. At the time, Cologne had made Ranma's skin super<br/>sensitive to hot water, it burned her too badly to let her change<br/>back, so she was stuck as a female."<p>"I made her sleep in my room for that time, until she finally got<br/>the cure from cologne. I didn't want either of our fathers to<br/>know she was crying herself to sleep each night and needing<br/>comfort each morning."<p>"I have taken care of him since then. Anytime he needs my help<br/>he comes home and I try to make him feel better. He also comes<br/>to see Tofu once a week for help dealing with the depression."<p>"When you came you tried to show Ranma you still loved him too.<br/>He might be subconsciencely trying to make you happy, so you<br/>won't stop and abandon him again. She hasn't said no to a single<br/>thing you asked of her, has she? When you're out at work with<br/>her, have you noticed if she hesitates if you ask her to do<br/>anything, no matter how uncomfortable it might have been making<br/>her?"<p>A look of Insight hit Nodoka. "I can usually seem to get her to<br/>dress up, even if the model coordinator can't."<p>"She's doing everything you ask, hoping it makes you happy."<p>"Hoping you won't stop loving me." Came a wavering voice from<br/>the windowsill.<p>There was onna-Ranma, tears in her eyes. She quickly crossed the<br/>room and pulled herself into her mother's embrace.<p>No one spoke for quite some time, though Kasumi was balanced on<br/>the edge of her chair, ready to add her arms to the huddle, or<br/>snatch up the redhead if she bolted for a corner.<p>"Pops... always made... I was a family shame." Ranma choked out<br/>between sobs.<p>Before another word could be uttered, Nodoka laid a finger softly<br/>over her mouth. "You father is gone now, and I am here. You<br/>don't have to believe him anymore. I never wanted you to leave,<br/>and I have cried over losing you. You don't need to be making me<br/>happy, I will love you no matter what."<p>Ranma closed her eyes and leaned against her mother again, still<br/>sniffling.<p>Tofu decided to interject. "Ranma. We were just digussing that<br/>day in the furo during the cat's tongue incident. I think we<br/>should explain the events comepletely, because Kasumi should not<br/>be forced to hide the truth alone."<p>Ranma's eyes snapped open. "I'm ashamed of that day, wouldn't<br/>you if you were in my place?"<p>Tofu shook his head. "It was a sign that you needed help Ranma.<br/>You need to get it out in the open, where others can help."<p>Ranma nodded, though shakily. "Momma. You remember at Cologne's<br/>place when I asked you if you would still love me if I was stuck<br/>as a girl forever? I almost came close to never changing back.<br/>I really honestly thought about it, but I didn't."<p>"I wondered as much dear. You told me how many times you had a<br/>nightmare about that, and about how you were ready to kill<br/>yourself..."<p>Her musing was broken as Ranma held up her right wrist and Nodoka<br/>could see it. Faint but still visable, was a jagged scar that<br/>went from her wrist halfway up her arm.<p>Kasumi hung her head while Tofu sat patiently waiting.<p>As Ranma brought her arm back down, she began to sob again. "I<br/>wasn't just ready, I almost went through with it. I wanted to<br/>end it all."<p>Nodoka had an even tighter grip on her female son than before.<br/>She refused to cry however. She needed to remain calm despite<br/>what this new revalation brought.<p>Tofu decided to explain. "Saotome san. Ranma had only made a<br/>scratch using a broken piece of glass, but she changed her mind,<br/>and then realized that she couldn't tell anyone. That is when<br/>Kasumi found her that day. In the worst attack of depression I<br/>have ever personally witnessed her having."<p>"She called me over immediately, and I dressed the wound as best<br/>I could with Ranma being a zombie. She did not return until the<br/>next morning, which is why Kasumi and I decided to hide her in<br/>her room. No one in the house suspected Kasumi was lying when<br/>she said that Ranma had left."<p>Nodoka had only partially caught this conversation as she was<br/>looking into her child's eyes once again. "Know I understand the<br/>pain and fear that has been in your eyes since your father's<br/>death."<p>"If you want to be my daughter, for your happiness, I will stand<br/>behind that decision.<p>Ranma continued to hug her. "I'm still trying to decide now. I<br/>just can't give up being a man that I trained to become, so I<br/>could go home." as she squeezed tightly, Nodoka doing the same.<p>Tofu's curiousity finally overwheled him. "Ranma, what happened<br/>to your curse? I can't sense the magic anymore."<p>Ranma-chan turned to him. "I have control of it now. Watch."<br/>Kasumi and Tofu were stunned as the transformation occurred<br/>spontaneously.<p>"Why didn't you tell us this Ranma?" Asked Kasumi.<p>Ranma just hung her head.<p>Tofu nodded with understanding. "Akane's pet Ryoga? Or Nabiki?"<p>"Is this what you meant, when you said you were thinking of never<br/>changing back Ranma?" asked Kasumi. "You gained control of it,<br/>but you could have never told anyone and acted as though you were<br/>trapped..."<p>"I almost did it, don't get me wrong. Momma promised to love me,<br/>but I couldn't let her lose her son again. I could have, but I<br/>didn't."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Two days after Nodoka, Kasumi and Onna-Ranma visited Dr. Tofu,<br/>Akane and Nabiki returned from school and entered the living room<br/>to find Nodoka and daughter sitting at the table, once again<br/>going through pictures.<p>"I don't know Mom. The sailor Moon getup is just too cheesy,<br/>plus the look on my face cause that tux was itching my legs."<p>"Alright dear, what about the one with you in the plugsuit<br/>mockups. Or maybe the Imperial Kimono look. It was beautiful."<p>Nabiki once again became engrossed in the goings on. After<br/>looking closely at one shot, she exclaimed.<p>"How did you get both of Ranma into one picture? I can't see the<br/>edit lines."<p>Nodoka chuckled softly, before pointing to the collar on the<br/>female Ranma's plugsuit. "It's actually not Ranma in the suit.<br/>The editor just pasted her head and neck on Atsuko's body,<br/>providing we streamlined her hair behind her to make editing<br/>easier."<p>She took the glossy out of Nabiki's hands. "I think this one<br/>dear. You look especially cheerful in it."<p>She slid it into a large frame and placed it up the mantle, next<br/>to another picture of Ranma's both sides. "There, no use getting<br/>your fingerprints all over it."<p>The girls together moved to the mantle and begin looking over the<br/>pictures. "Wow, each one looks like brother and sister posing<br/>together." remarked Nabiki. "I am impressed."<p>Nodoka smiled and gave Ranma-chan a hug from behind. "I wanted<br/>something to be able to look at while you are at school, so I<br/>wouldn't feel like I was letting you go every morning."<p>Ranma-chan blushed slightly and closed her eyes.<p>It was at that point that two bouquets of roses flew in and onto<br/>the table from the yard. Tatawaki Kuno strolled in after. "I<br/>would wish to see the foul sorceror, so that I may beat him in<br/>combat and win the heart of my true loves. And speak of beauty,<br/>I am in their presence."<p>"May I help you young man?" Inquired Nodoka. She moved, placing<br/>herself between Ranma and Tatewaki.<p>Kuno noticed she moved with a warrior's style. He faced her and<br/>proudly puffed out his chest.<p>"I am the undefeated Kendo champion of Furikan High. The one<br/>known as 'The Blue Thunder!'."<p>Nodoka was unimpressed. "I have heard of you Kuno Tatawaki, and<br/>I challenge you for the the honor of my family. Your lies and<br/>accusations about my son and daughter demand retrobution."<p>With that Kuno heard the unmistakable hiss of steel being<br/>unshiethed. Nodoka's Katana appeared in her hand with a flick of<br/>her wrists and she slashed at him in midair. He found himself<br/>thrown against a wall by a current of air and pinned by several<br/>small dart objects.<p>Nodoka had the tip of her blade poking him in the chest. "Do you<br/>submit?"<p>"What trickery is this?" He nearly shouted out. "You attack a<br/>guest?"<p>Nodoka calmly replied. "You come into my house uninvited and<br/>state boldly and loudly that you are here to defeat my son on the<br/>basis of lies you yourself conjoured. You state you wish battle<br/>and come armed, and you call yourself a guest?"<p>She continued, giving Kuno the biggest ego-deflating talking down<br/>he had ever had.<p>"You have repeatedly endangered the life of my family because of<br/>deluisions that my son is having his way with his OWN SISTER!<br/>You have repeatedly lied and refused to admit to defeat in<br/>honorable combat with my son. I will not sit idlly by and let<br/>you MOLEST my families' honor and good name anymore. You will<br/>accept defeat by my hand and leave. You are not Man enough to be<br/>a proper Husband to either my niece Akane nor my own daughter."<p>Kuno was stuttering. "The p-pig-tailed girl is your daughter?"<p>Nabiki grabbed one of the pictures off the mantle and handed it<br/>to him. "See for yourself. Can't you tell the resemblance?"<p>With his free hand, Kuno took the framed picture and held it at<br/>arms length. Then his eyes widened and he brought it only inches<br/>from his face.<p>Everyone watched as his face drained of all color, then he turned<br/>toward Ranma-chan with a mechanical slowness. He seemed to stare<br/>at her, and she became rather uncomfortable. Her smile gone,<br/>replaced with a slight twinge of fear. She changed stance<br/>preparing to jump backward or attack if need be.<p>He stuttered again, this time nodding shakily. "It-It-It's true.<br/>It's true." He turned again slowly to Nodoka. "I ... conceed."<br/>There was a pause before he swallowed a mouthful of air and<br/>composed himself. "Please allow me to apologize before leaving."<p>Nodoka stepped forward and pulled out the darts holding his other<br/>arm to the wall and he took his bokken from his belt. He handed<br/>the picture back to Nabiki.<p>Holding the wooden blade in front of him like an offering, he<br/>turned toward Ranma-chan and kneeled, laying it at her feet.<p>"Please forgive me fair-haired one. I have caused you much pain<br/>with my slander and I now know how wrong I was. Please take my<br/>blade as a token offering of my promise to right what I have<br/>wronged and to never cause you any more anguish again."<p>With that Kuno stood and left by walking out backwards until he<br/>was outside and turned, leaping over the wall.<p>Akane and Ranma-chan were stunned. "Did I just see what I<br/>thought happened?" asked Akane.<p>Nabiki looked out toward the direction. "Maybe Kuno-baby got a<br/>clue, but I doubt it. He'll probably deny it all tomorrow.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>As Tatawaki was walking home, he pondered the events of the last<br/>few minutes. Something had finally made itself perfectly clear.<br/>He had indeed been the idiot that all had proclaimed him to be.<p>He suddenly noticed movement out of the corner of his eye.<p>He turned and recognized Kodochi making a beeline path across the<br/>rooftops toward the Tendo Dojo and quickly doubled back and began<br/>chasing her as quickly as he could.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka turned to walk into the kitchen to fix the evening meal<br/>when a small bag flew in the open Shoji doors from outside,<br/>striking her on the shoulder.<p>A small cloud of dust surrounded her head and shoulders, and a<br/>second later, she collapsed toward the floor.<p>Ranma-chan was under her and caught her, laying her on the table<br/>cushions.<p>"OH-HO-HO-HO-HO-HO! You value your sevant's life too much, you<br/>little hussy. I have come to save my Ranma-sama from your<br/>twisted hooks."<p>Nabiki looked outside. "Her twisted hooks?. That's no servant,<br/>that's Ranma's mother."<p>Kodachi was smiling until Nabiki's words registered. She looked<br/>around the room, and noticed the concern and shock on Akane and<br/>Kasumi's face.<p>When she turned back, Ranma-chan was facing her. This time<br/>however, it was the not the cool, calm, but highly irritated<br/>face she knew from the red-headed girl, but something totally<br/>different.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Amist a blackness, The curse calling herself Ranko had her eyes<br/>closed and her arms streached outward. Emmense light streaming<br/>from her hands, and from her hair, as she focused her energy<br/>outward. The rumbling would have deafened any mortal, were she<br/>actually somewhere outside Ranma's mind. But she was channeling<br/>power and she had made her decision.<p>Her eyes flew open, and she screamed. "NEVER AGAIN!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Cologne was standing over her stewpot, watching a soup simmer,<br/>when her ears perked up.<p>She turned a shade of white and grabbed her staff. She hopped to<br/>the door, calling for Shampoo. "Hurry child, Son-in-Law is in<br/>trouble. Mu-Tsu, tend the cafe until we return."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kodachi backed away as Ranma-chan seemed to be stalking toward<br/>her. A red aura powerful enough to be seen by ordinary humans<br/>mimiced flames coming off her body. The pupils of her eyes lost,<br/>replaced with solid white orbs and her teeth gritted as she<br/>continued to stalk the now terrified Kuno. Where she stepped,<br/>the floor blackened from the heat of her rage.<p>Suddenly Ranma-chan blasted forward, faster and more ferocious<br/>than ever. Kodachi tried to block, but was struck with a kick,<br/>too fast to be seen by the naked eye and with enough force<br/>behind it that she was knocked out of the house and against the<br/>outside wall. She felt and heard ribs snapping on impact.<p>As she dropped down off the wall, Ranma blasted forward agin,<br/>toward her. Her mind registered that her attacker wasn't even<br/>running, but flying like a bullet toward her. She put up her<br/>arms to block again, her legs too weak to move, but was kicked<br/>from the side, this time getting thrown against the dojo.<p>She regained her wind and quickly dodged as Ranma-chan plowed<br/>past her, into and through the Dojo wall, missing her by inches.<p>She didn't have time to turn before hands burst through the wall<br/>grabbing her arms, and the rest of Ranma tearing through like the<br/>wall was tissue paper.<p>Kodachi screamed as her arms were twisted backward, her skin<br/>burning around the smaller girls hands. She heard bones breaking<br/>as her left arm snapped under the strain.<p>The last thing kodachi saw before she was slugged ubruptly in the<br/>face was Ranma-chan cursing her. "You Demon-Whore. You will<br/>NEVER hurt us or our mother EVER AGAIN!"<p>Kodachi was brutally punched several more times in the solar<br/>plexus, then uncerimoniously dropped into the pond. Ranma-chan<br/>stood over it. Clenched fists, followed by tears.<p>Ranma-chan started crying. she dropped to her knees and her aura<br/>faded. "Why, WHY can't he have peace? WHY, WHY WHY?"<p>She continued this strange query, directed to no one in<br/>piticular, before screaming animalistically upward at the stars<br/>then collapsing herself and falling over, curling up into a ball.<p>Cologne hopped over the wall, seeing Kodachi and Ranma-chan lying<br/>in their places, she went for Ranma, and shouted to Shampoo to<br/>get the injured gymnast out of the pond before she drowned.<p>Tatawaki jumped over the wall at this time as well. He saw the<br/>damage and the broken state of his sister's body. He grabbed<br/>Kodachi's arm and pulled her out of the pond, saving Shampoo from<br/>having to get a pole to fish the girl out.<p>He stood over Kodachi and spit at her feet. "Is she still alive,<br/>or did the fair-haired one end her miserable excuse for<br/>existance?"<p>Cologne hopped over, having checked Ranma-chan and found nothing<br/>wrong, the girl's chi returning to a relaxed state.<p>She then checked Kodachi's pulse, and chi paths. "She is alive,<br/>but badly hurt. Many of her bones were broken."<p>Kuno looked around before scooping her up. "It is unfortunate<br/>that she was working on a explosive device in our kitchen wasn't<br/>it?."<p>He swept up his sister's limp form, threw it over his shoulder<br/>then turned and cleared the wall once again, dissappearing and<br/>all was quiet again.<p>Akane was still looking outward toward the wall, when Nabiki<br/>commented. "I don't believe it."<p>Shampoo looked toward Cologne. "What he mean by explosive in<br/>kitchen?"<p>Cologne raised her eyebrow. "Coverup child. He was leaving<br/>Son-in Law out of the obvious police investigation. But for what<br/>reasons I do not know. It would not seem like him."<p>She turned to Ranma-chan. (That was not your handiwork boy.<br/>Brutal and ruthless. She would have died, and unless your rage<br/>consumed you completely, you would never have been so violent.<br/>What could possibly have triggered such force.)<p>She then noticed Nodoka asleep inside. She approached and could<br/>feel her body was drugged to sleep. (Now it makes sense. Her<br/>mother, her only measure of love and sanity in this house,<br/>attacked. But martial art that was not. That was something far<br/>more powerful, to be felt from the Nekohanten.)<p>Cologne tapped a few pressure points and instructed Shampoo to<br/>retreive Ranma-chan from outside.<p>Kasumi and Akane helped place both of them on the floor, side by<br/>side, to sleep off what had overcome them.<p>She turned to Kasumi. "Something posessed Ranma just now.<br/>Something more powerful than anything I have ever felt before.<br/>And I felt it from the cafe no less. Her actions were not hers,<br/>but someone or something else's. It's intent I could not<br/>determine, but it seems to be gone now."<p>"They will both wake up in several hours. Do not tell Ranma<br/>what she did. She may or may not remember. Just say that<br/>Tatewaki came and took his sister away."<p>Everyone nodded and Cologne started to leave. She stopped. "I<br/>want Shampoo to stay here in case anything else happens. If<br/>that's alright with you."<p>Kasumi nodded. "If she promises not to attack anyone, that<br/>includes Amazon glomps and kisses."<p>Cologne smiled slightly. "I don't think will be a problem."<p>Shampoo nodded. "Hai."<p>Cologne chuckled as she walked out. "You don't want to have a<br/>'Kitchen Accident' do you?"<p>And Cologne hopped over the wall, leaving the Tendo girls and<br/>Shampoo to watch over the sleeping Saotomes.</p>
