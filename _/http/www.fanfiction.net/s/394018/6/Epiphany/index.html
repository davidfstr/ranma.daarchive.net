</div><p><b>Epiphany Chapter 6<br/></b><br/>By Tripolar Disorder</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranko held Ranma-chan in her arms, within the little room within<br/>her mind.<p>Unlike the last time, there was no weeping or tear-filled eyes.<br/>Ranma-chan wasn't crying, just sitting relaxed, and leaning<br/>against her twin for comfort.<p>"I'm sorry Ranma, I don't know what came over me. I felt your<br/>pain as your mother fell asleep, and I thought you were going to<br/>just curl up next to her and cry. I couldn't let that happen, I<br/>promised myself I wouldn't let anyone hurt you ever again if I<br/>could help it." Ranko continued to shake her head.<p>Ranma-chan looked into her eyes. Her face was emotionless but<br/>firm. "Promise me you won't try to kill someone next time. All<br/>the other stuff was okay but when you dropped her into the water<br/>she could have drowned, and how would it look to have a Koi-pond<br/>of Drowned Insane Martial arts gymnast in our own backyard."<p>Then her lips curled up into a smile. "Thank you Ko-chan. Thank<br/>you for caring, and for wanting to help. I knew you wouldn't<br/>have let her die."<p>Ranko sighed. "I'm not exactly like you Ranma. I don't have a<br/>little voice inside my head to tell me not to do something. I<br/>don't really know if I would have fished her out."<p>Ranma-chan hugged her back tightly. "Don't say that Ko-chan.<br/>You wanted me to feel better and gave me the ability to change,<br/>so you must have something. I know you would have done the right<br/>thing, no matter how we feel about her. If you were a real girl<br/>you would be a kind and loving person, not just what you did<br/>today."<p>"Really Ranma? You really think so?"<p>"Yes Ko-chan."<p>Ranko looked as though she was about to cry, and Ranma-chan found<br/>herself comforting her twin for a change.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The next morning, the wonderful smells of breakfast stirred the<br/>sleeping individuals in the living room.<p>Shampoo opened her eyes to find several smiling faces staring at<br/>her. Ranma-chan pointed to her left and she turned her head<br/>until her chin came in contact with Nabiki's hair. During the<br/>night Nabiki's head had slid down until it was on her shoulder. A<br/>terribly evil idea crossed her mind.<p>She gently nudged Nabiki and her eyes opened as well. She looked<br/>around and realized her situation. Speechless, she stared at<br/>Shampoo with large eyes.<p>As Nabiki started to move away Shampoo smiled, and grabbed her in<br/>a standard amazon glomp. Nabiki was stunned, her heart beating<br/>out of her chest and her eyes as wide as small ice cream dishes.<p>Shampoo laid her head on Nabiki's shoulder. "Shampoo no think<br/>mercenary girl cared?" This was followed by a brief kiss right<br/>on the lips. "Wo ay ni Arien." She said in a breathy voice.<p>Nabiki struggled free and dashed upstairs fast enough that a gold<br/>medal runner would be proud.<p>Everyone downstairs didn't know what to say. They were all<br/>witness to the most unusual site yet. Ranma-chan was the first<br/>to speak.<p>"Ummm, Shampoo? Did you just give the kiss of marriage to<br/>Nabiki?"<p>Shampoo giggled. "Hiya, course not Arien, but mercenary girl not<br/>need to know that. Will hope that gets her back for taking<br/>picture of Shampoo without clothes.<p>Nodoka and Akane were laughing, while Ranma had this rejected<br/>look on her face. "Darn, I was hoping you were giving up on me."<p>Another collective chuckle before Shampoo had to leave. She<br/>thanked Kasumi and bowed to Ranma before taking off.<p>Akane continued to stare blankly in the direction that Shampoo<br/>went. "Ranma, have you wondered why she has been so nice to you<br/>lately?"<p>Ranma-chan shook her head. "Nope no clue. I haven't seen her<br/>since the day with the furo incident. It feels good though. I<br/>hope it lasts for awhile."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>(later that day)<p>Akane was in her practice gi, walking out to the Dojo, when she<br/>past the family room. Inside she found Kasumi trying to comfort<br/>Ranma-chan who was kneeling in front of the futon Nodoka had been<br/>on earlier. Their backs were toward her.<p>Ranma was stuttering between sniffles. "This reminds me ... of<br/>the day I came ... here. We were all sitting around your father<br/>... and Akane ... she wanted ... she wanted ... to be...",<br/>then her emotions took over and she was crying too hard to<br/>continue.<p>Kasumi was rocking her back and forth. "I remember Ranma. I<br/>remember what she said, and after we found out about your curse,<br/>we pushed you away. I'm sorry"<p>"Ryoga hates me, and Ukyo just wants to marry me. I don't want<br/>that. If it wasn't for pops then..."<p>Akane stood in silence. She didn't know what to say. All this<br/>time and she had no idea what a single statement had meant to<br/>him. She felt her heart breaking and the blood drain from her<br/>face. She tried to visualize a list of people that she could<br/>call his friends, but found she could not put anyone on it.<p>A single image fixed in her minds eye. It was of him sitting<br/>against a tree, in the corner of the school yard everyday at<br/>lunch. Alone. Ukyo and Shampoo would show up only to try and<br/>prove how well they could cook. Then she thought about her own<br/>actions. (I just ignore him too. We all just use him and take<br/>him for granted.)<p>Kasumi was still hugging Ranma-chan. "Ranma, we are friends now.<br/>I care about you and I know Akane does too. We didn't know how<br/>you felt. You never told us."<p>What Akane couldn't see, since both had their back to her, was<br/>that both Ranma-chan and Kasumi were in fact grinning and doing<br/>their best to sound honest and sincere.<p>Akane was having trouble standing. She was trying her best to<br/>keep her knees from buckling and falling out from under her, but<br/>Kasumi's words rang through her mind. (I do care about Ranma,<br/>don't I? Yes!) She steeled her resolve, and walked around to<br/>Ranma-chan's right.<p>Akane wiped her eyes with one hand and with a shaky voice, held<br/>out the other. "H-h-hi I'm A-Akane, wanna be... friends?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane and Onna-Ranma were both sitting over-looking the yard,<br/>their feet hanging off the edge of the wooden floor of the dojo.<br/>Kasumi had cleverly bowed out with an excuse about making dinner.<p>Akane was staring down at her feet, watching her bare toes part<br/>the blades of grass. "I am sorry I forgot about you, red-haired<br/>girl. I said some things that I regret now."<p>Ranma-chan lowered her head at hearing this. Akane tapped her<br/>shoulder a few times until Ranma looked into her eyes.<p>"I'm sorry Ranma. I didn't want a fiancée but when we found out<br/>you were a girl I thought you looked sad. You really surprised<br/>me in that sparring match. I was impressed."<p>"I forgot all about that after we saw each other in the bath. I<br/>forgot that I had promised to be your friend. All I could think<br/>about was your curse. You were the worst kind of pervert I could<br/>think of and it clouded my judgment. I know now that you are<br/>completely the opposite."<p>Ranma countered, while her eyes also never left her feet. "I<br/>have a confession to make Akane. I really am a pervert." She<br/>was twiddling her index fingertips. "I thought you looked<br/>beautiful when you walked in on me."<p>Ranma looked over to see her companion blushing severely. She<br/>stared at Akane's face with fascination. Akane turned toward her.<br/>"Well, I thought you were very handsome too, although I was<br/>jealous of this.." She pointed towards Ranma's left breast.<br/>"I thought you were calling me un-cute because you compared<br/>yourself to me."<p>Ranma sighed. "I am the jealous one Akane. You seem so happy<br/>when you are around your sisters and I didn't have anyone until<br/>mom showed up. It hurt that none of you wanted me. I felt all<br/>alone again."<p>"I just lashed out at everything ... and everyone that hurts me.<br/>I wish I could've known what to say to make it better, right<br/>then. Then maybe you would have wanted to be my friend instead<br/>of an unwanted fiancée."<p>Akane watched as Ranma pulled her legs up against her chest,<br/>burying her face between her legs.<p>It was Akane's turn to stare at her feet. The sound of a<br/>sniffling nose brought her out of feeling sorry for herself.<p>She could see the smaller girl shaking, silently crying. The<br/>only sound being made was her nose trying to hold back the need<br/>for a tissue.<p>Akane grabbed Ranma-chan into a fierce embrace. She held her<br/>tightly, almost squeezing the air from Ranma's lungs.<p>She realized how hard she was squeezing and changed to a light<br/>embrace, then stared directly into Ranma's eyes. All she could<br/>see was tears rolling down her cheeks as emotion forced itself<br/>from within.<p>Ranma tried to turn away, her eyes closed. "Please, don't look<br/>at me this way. I'm not supposed to cry. It's weak and I'm not<br/>supposed to be weak."<p>Akane pulled her in closer, sensing that ignoring her companion<br/>would only make the situation worse.<p>A few minutes went by as one girl tried to compose herself with<br/>the other continued to hold her.<p>Finally, Ranma looked up into Akane's eyes. She looked as though<br/>a horrible secret was trying to tear itself out of her. "I..."<br/>was all she said.<p>"What is it Ranma? Is there something wrong?"<p>Ranma took her right arm to her stomach, pressing against her<br/>shirt. "I am ... tired of this life Akane. I want all the pain<br/>to end and I don't know how."<p>These words registered like a large animal raking it's claws<br/>across Akane's back. "What pain Ranma? I don't understand."<p>Onna-Ranma just continued to stare at the grass. "I can't<br/>possibly be the man my father wanted of me. I can hardly look<br/>myself in the mirror. I'll never be more than a burden to<br/>whoever I end up having to marry. I want it all to end."<p>"What do you mean Ranma? You aren't seriously thinking of<br/>suicide?"<p>"What if you hadn't seen the other me in the bath? You know, if<br/>you always thought I was a girl? I wonder how long I could've<br/>kept hiding the truth? You and I might be ... having fun<br/>together doing... whatever you and your friends do when I'm not<br/>around."<p>Akane sighed. "I don't think it would have lasted Ranma. Even<br/>if you could have managed to hide your male half, Genma could<br/>change back into a man, and he would have spilled the beans."<p>Ranma nodded, another tear punctuating the realization she now<br/>had. "You're right you know. It's all just some stupid dream I<br/>wish was the truth."<p>"Would you rather be a girl Ranma?"<p>"I don't know yet. I wonder sometimes, but I'm not ready to make<br/>a choice."<p>"I want you to know something. No matter what you decide. I<br/>still ... love you Ranma." Akane's face was as red as ever. She<br/>could not explain the way she was feeling. She turned her head<br/>away from Ranma.<p>She felt it being slowly turned back by a Ranma-chan's hand. She<br/>forced herself to look into Ranma's eyes, those deep pool of blue<br/>that mirrored the person behind it. Akane could see what she was<br/>thinking. (He loves me too. I can't believe after all I do to<br/>him and he still loves me.)<p>"How? With the way I treat you? How can you say that?"<p>Akane closed her eyes. "Because I mean it. I think that I hurt<br/>myself more when I strike out at you. I feel inside all the pain<br/>you get just trying to defend and protect me."<p>Ranma looked at her, surprised at her confession. Akane took the<br/>advantage, leaned forward, and their lips touched for several<br/>moments, before parting. Ranma looked both surprised and happy,<br/>if that was possible. Akane mused that she had caught the<br/>smaller girl off guard for once.<p>"You have me Ranma. I think I'm being swept off my feet by the<br/>lack of your usual behavior. I want take this slowly though,<br/>'cause I'm not quite ready for sex with a girl yet."<p>Ranma looked at her strangely confused. "Umm Akane? Whats Sex?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>What did you think was going to happen here, you major Hentai.<br/>Maybe when I get to be a better writer.</p>
