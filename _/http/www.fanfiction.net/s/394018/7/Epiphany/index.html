</div><p>Epiphany Chapter 7</p><p>By Tripolar Disorder</p><p>And now the  continuing story...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-Chan held Akane's limp form in her arms for a few  moments<br/>until she came to. Akane stared directly back into  Ranma's<br/>face with a look of strange happiness. She giggled a  little.<p>Ranma continued to hold her, and held nothing but  concern in her<br/>eyes.</p><p>Akane regained her footing and took a  step away from Ranma-Chan.<br/>"I thought you just said you don't  know what sex is. That<br/>was funny Ranma."</p><p>Ranma-Chan  looked at her. "I don't think women can have sex with<br/>each  other."</p><p>Akane looked at her with a strange  smile.</p><p>Ranma-Chan continued to press her point. "You know  what I mean.<br/>Neither of us have the right uhm-equipment."</p><p>Akane  began to laugh in a forced manner. She grabbed Ranma-Chan<br/>by the  arm and dragged her into the house.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka held one eyebrow raised while trying and failing to  hide a<br/>smile. Ranma-Chan was staring at her as if she grown  another<br/>head.<p>Nodoka cleared her throat. "Well,  dear... ahh, it is a little<br/>difficult to explain. well uhm, two  girls ... well, they just<br/>love each other differently than if one  was a man."</p><p>Nabiki looks up from her magazine and says in  a very dull blunt<br/>tone. "Yeah, Ranma, they use their  tongues."</p><p>Hostile glares from both Nodoka and Akane  persuaded Nabiki to<br/>exit the room.</p><p>Ranma-Chan stood there,  a blank expression on her face. After<br/>what was less than ten  seconds, but felt like longer for her<br/>mother, she responded. "I  don't get it. The Panda never<br/>explained sex to me at all."  She dropped onto a cushion at the<br/>table, laying her arms crossed  on the surface and hiding her head<br/>behind them.</p><p>"I  must be an idiot to not understand sex. I barely understand<br/>how a  man would do it, and right now the idea of it in this body<br/>gives  me the chills."</p><p>Nodoka sweatdroped and her face changed  to a brilliant crimson.<br/>She sighed. "Ranma, there is a time  in every parent's life when<br/>they have to sit down and explain this  to their children."</p><p>"I cannot allow you to accept  the responsibility for not being<br/>informed. A mother is expected to  teach her daughter about her<br/>body and now that you are my daughter  as well as my son, I have<br/>been failing in my duty  twice-fold."</p><p>Ranma-Chan looked up suddenly as she heard  this. "Momma, please.<br/>You didn't do anything wrong. I didn't  mean to hurt you."</p><p>Ranma-Chan was on her feet in an  instant, making a sprint for the<br/>hallway, when her forward  momentum was stopped by a hand, firmly<br/>grasped around the back of  her shirt.</p><p>"Ranma. Please don't run away from this. You  needn't feel shame<br/>about this." Nodoka spoke as she continued  to restrain the now<br/>sobbing redhead with one hand, while her other  hand tightly<br/>clenched over her heart.</p><p>She then took  her child down the hall, leading her with her hand<br/>on Ranma's  shoulders. "My dear, I think it's time I explained a<br/>few  things and this isn't the right place for it."</p><p>Akane was  leaning down the hall enough to see Nodoka escort Ranma<br/>into the  furo, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>"Uhm, Akane. You  think Ranma ever experimented with her female<br/>body?" Asked  Kasumi, still sitting at the table.</p><p>Akane broke her stare,  turning to the source of the question.<br/>"Well... no,  actually. She just said that it made her sick."</p><p>"I  heard that. But I wasn't referring to sex with another man."</p><p>Akane's  eyebrow lifted questioningly as she stared down her elder<br/>sister  with one eye.</p><p>"What are you talking about then?"</p><p>"I  believe it's called Masturbation Akane. You ever think.."</p><p>"No  Kasumi. I don't think so. If it was any other male I know<br/>that had  the curse, I wouldn't hesitate in saying yes."</p><p>"But  you call her a pervert almost constantly."</p><p>"Yeah, I  know.. " she said, her voice drifted off on the  last<br/>syllable.</p><p>"So, does that mean she isn't? Even in  your eyes?"</p><p>"I guess so."</p><p>"Then  why?" Was Kasumi's only response.</p><p>"I... I... don't  know. I guess I'm just jealous."</p><p>"Of what?"</p><p>"Ranma  makes a prettier girl than me, he's a better fighter than<br/>me,  she... he, whatever is better than me at everything."</p><p>"Does  it really matter? She obviously cares for you. Isn't that<br/>what you  want, someone who..."</p><p>"Who told me that she loves  me?" Akane interrupted.</p><p>"He finally told you?"</p><p>"No,  He didn't. She did. She, thinking of herself as a girl.<br/>Trying to  think of my feelings, having to be in love with her as<br/>a girl."</p><p>A  short pause ended with Akane adding. "I told her that we  could<br/>love each other, even as girls."</p><p>"Did you  mean it?"</p><p>Akane looked away from her sister. "I want  to say yes. I think<br/>I can still love her."</p><p>"Even  if she decides to stop being a man?"</p><p>Akane closed her  eyes. "Yes Kasumi. I fell in love the first<br/>time I saw her,  and it was Nabiki that pointed out Ranma was<br/>female. It scared me  and I'm still scared by that."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because  it means I'm not normal."</p><p>"You think Ranma is  normal?"</p><p>"Very funny Kasumi. Nothing about Ranma is  normal."</p><p>"Then why do you think you have to  be?"</p><p>Akane looked up into her sister's gently smiling  face.</p><p>"You're scary when you're right."</p><p>"I'm  glad we had this talk Akane."</p><p>"Me too Kasumi, me  too."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi and Akane were still sitting at the table, watching  a<br/>television program, two hours later, when Nodoka returned  from<br/>the furo, sans Ranma.<p>With a mischievous grin on her  face, Nodoka cleared her throat.<br/>"Sorry to intrude on the  conversation, but I was wondering if<br/>either of you girls could  lend me your vibrator for a few<br/>minutes?"</p><p>Kasumi  blushed. Akane spit out her sip of tea across the table.<br/>Nodoka  looked at the two stammering young women and decided to go<br/>ask  Nabiki.</p><p>Walking up the stairs and down the hall, she knocked  on Nabiki's<br/>door. She was greeting by an equally mischievous  grin.</p><p>"Nabiki dear, could I borrow your  vibrator?"</p><p>Nabiki came to a grinding halt. Her face now  devoid of emotion.<br/>She turned around and went to her dresser. She  removed a small<br/>rectangular box from the drawer, and handed it to  Nodoka.</p><p>"I just bought this one, and you don't have to  return it."<br/>By this time Nabiki was grinning again, but felt  she had to ask<br/>just one more thing. "Teaching Ranma about the  joys of<br/>womanhood, auntie Saotome?"</p><p>Nodoka nodded and  smiled, before turning and leaving the room.</p><p>A few minutes  after Akane and Kasumi watched Nodoka return to the<br/>furo, they  were startled by a loud squeak which Akane thought<br/>might have been  a nervous outcry from Ranma-Chan.</p><p>They were about to listen  for more, when they heard a crash<br/>upstairs followed by Nabiki  running down the hallway at an<br/>impressive speed, followed  closely on her heels by a strange<br/>purple streak.</p><p>Akane  turned toward Kasumi. "Didn't that look like Shampoo in a<br/>violet  leotard?"</p><p>Kasumi shook her head. "No Akane, it was a  body stocking."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A short while later Ranma, Akane, Nabiki and Kasumi were  sitting<br/>at the table waiting for lunch.<p>Akane was pale,  while Nabiki had a smile going from ear to ear.<br/>Ranma-Chan was  blushing head to toe. Even her hands were pink.<br/>She was doing her  best to ignore the fact that she looked like a<br/>boiled lobster.  Akane noticed she was shivering.</p><p>Kasumi was patting Ranma-Chan  on the shoulder. "You should calm<br/>down Ranma. You look like  you are going to pass out. Do you<br/>want me to make you some tea to  calm your nerves."</p><p>Ranma-Chan stuttered. "N-N-No  thanks K-Kasumi, I'll be F-Fine."<br/>And then she proceeded to  blush a deeper shade of red, which<br/>didn't seem possible a few  moments ago.</p><p>Nabiki turned toward Akane. "You should be  thankful Akane. At<br/>least Ranma-Chan isn't a screamer."</p><p>Ranma-Chan  jumped up. "What's that supposed to me?"</p><p>Akane  backhanded Nabiki hard in the stomach, causing her to<br/>double over.  "It's nothing Ranma, Nabiki likes to think dirty.<br/>She's the  real pervert here. I might be tempted to tie her down<br/>and call up  her favorite purple haired Amazon."</p><p>Nabiki blanched as  her eyes grew large. "You wouldn't dare!"</p><p>Akane  smiled sweetly. "Auto-dial number two" was all she  said,<br/>while holding her fingers in a V-shape.</p><p>Ranma-Chan  and Kasumi tried to hide soft giggling, Ranma turning<br/>her head  away while Kasumi simply put her hand over her mouth.<br/>Nabiki  growled at both of them, but it had no effect except to<br/>spurn them  further.</p><p>Nabiki lifted her arm as though to punch Ranma, who  noticed it<br/>and stopped snickering. Ranma was on her feet in only  an<br/>instant, moving to the door before she turned back. Her  face<br/>was now more sullen. "I shouldn't be laughing. I hate it  when<br/>people laugh at me, and all I want to do is hit them. I'm  sorry<br/>Nabiki."</p><p>Then Ranma-Chan turned and left,  slowly padding down the hallway<br/>and disappearing up the  stairs.</p><p>Nabiki's fist hadn't moved, still ready to assail  someone who was<br/>no longer there. She pulled her arm down out of  the air. She<br/>turned toward her sisters who looked both surprised  and upset at<br/>her.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Kasumi sighed.  "I can't say anything. I was laughing too,<br/>though I feel bad  now. Not really for you though."</p><p>Akane decided to air her  opinion. "You laugh at her expense<br/>whenever you can. You even  profit on it, now you try to hit her<br/>just for joining in on a  small chuckle while the tables are<br/>turned. You're horrible  Nabiki."</p><p>Nabiki turned and looked back at Akane. "Like  you aren't? You<br/>do the same thing and he lets you get away with  it. Why should<br/>you be special?"</p><p>Akane lowered her  head. "You're right you know. She does let me<br/>pound her all  the time for no good reason. It's because she<br/>loves me."</p><p>"Well,  maybe I should get Ranma to love me then. If his 'un-cute<br/>Fiancée'  can do it, I should have him easily wrapped around my<br/>finger  better than you."</p><p>Akane slammed her fist down onto the  tabletop, snapping it in<br/>half, it halves falling into a wide  V-shape on the floor.</p><p>"It ends now. I will Never hurt  Ranma again. I swear it, and I<br/>won't ask anything of her in return  either. But like hell I will<br/>let you hurt her anymore, physically  or otherwise. I'll send you<br/>through the roof if you make her shed  even a single tear. Sister<br/>or not."</p><p>With that Akane  stood up and stormed out of the room leaving a<br/>very surprised and  confused Kasumi, and an equally confused<br/>Nabiki.</p><p>Nodoka  appeared from the kitchen, hearing the table snap. "What<br/>happened  in here?"</p><p>"Do.. do you think..." Kasumi tried  to stammer out.</p><p>"Think Akane is finally caring for Him,  her, Whatever?" Finished<br/>Nabiki.</p><p>Kasumi looked toward  the direction that her younger sister had<br/>exited by. "I hope  so."</p><p>As do I. Nodoka thought to herself.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane found Ranma in her room. The recent addition of  a<br/>queen-sized western bed sat against the window, with  Ranma<br/>sitting curled up on top of the comforter with her back to  the<br/>door.<p>"Please Akane. I didn't mean to laugh."  Onna-Ranma stated<br/>almost zombie-like and emotionless.</p><p>"Ranma.  I'm not going to hit you."</p><p>"Why not? I laughed at  Nabiki."</p><p>"Because I know that you don't deserve to  be hit."</p><p>There was no response. Ranma was still curled up  and very<br/>vulnerable, at least to Akane.</p><p>She placed a hand  on Ranma's side, only to watch the girl tense<br/>up, becoming almost  rigid.</p><p>Akane hesitated for a few seconds, before her other arm  found<br/>it's way around Ranma's stomach, and she snaked her  hands<br/>together, interlocking her fingers.</p><p>With each passing  second, Ranma seemed to be getting more tense.<br/>Akane was  experiencing greater levels of shivering, until Ranma<br/>finally  blurted out, "Will you hit me or pile-drive me into the<br/>floor,  or whatever you planned to do already? I haven't got all<br/>day!"</p><p>Now  it was Akane's turn to shiver. "I'm not going to hurt  you<br/>anymore. I'm trying to make you feel better not worse."</p><p>She  held the tense girl in her arms, eventually feeling straining<br/>muscles  loosen up, but Ranma still did not move from her  little<br/>ball.</p><p>"Ranma, please believe me. I'm not going  to hurt you."</p><p>"I'll just annoy you somehow. It never  fails to happen. Please<br/>let go of me."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Silence  and only the sound of her own breathing reined in on<br/>Akane's ears  for the longest time. She pulled the redhead in<br/>against her as  close as possible without crushing her.</p><p>Finally Ranma's eye  appeared as her head lifted out from between<br/>her knees, turned and  tilted back, so she could see Akane, eye to<br/>eye.</p><p>"Why  won't you let me go? Why won't you leave? What... do  you<br/>want?"</p><p>Akane wanted to speak, and say 'nothing.'  but she just looked<br/>back trying to show her resolve.</p><p>Ranma's  eye began to blink faster, a tear falling and rolling<br/>down across  her lower eyelid, as she continued to stare back at<br/>Akane.</p><p>With  little effort, Akane lifted the girl off the bed, turned and<br/>laid  her down on her side.</p><p>Ranma's legs no longer had the bed to  keep her legs forced up<br/>against her chest, and she let them fall  limp as she was laid on<br/>the bed.</p><p>Akane then laid down  behind her, never letting her go. She<br/>waited patiently and was  finally rewarded as Ranma broke down.</p><p>All this was being  watched by a tiny pair of eyes from near the<br/>door.</p><p>What's  he trying to do! He's got Akane believing he's hurt!<br/>THE  BASTARD!</p><p>Just as Ranma was beginning to open up and let out  whatever pain<br/>she was holding onto, she jerked out of Akane's grip,  twisting and<br/>arching her back almost into a U-shape.</p><p>Akane  was wondering what had gotten into her, until she saw<br/>P - Chan  firmly clamped onto Ranma's ankle.</p><p>Said redhead hadn't even  cried out, but was now flailing around,<br/>trying to shake the piglet  off. "Let me go!" She screamed, in a<br/>manner so unlike  Ranma's usual tone of voice.</p><p>Akane heard the pain resonating  behind it, not the pain of being<br/>bitten, but something else, far  worse.</p><p>P - Chan could no longer hold his grip as Ranma-Chan  made a<br/>high-speed axe-kick, throwing the piglet across the  room.</p><p>P - Chan landed on all fours, and charged only to be  grabbed by<br/>Akane.</p><p>"Bad P - Chan. Bad. Mommy wasn't in  danger."</p><p>P - Chan just squealed in protest, struggling to  get out of her<br/>arms and attack Ranma again.</p><p>Ranma was just  staring at the piglet. P - Chan realized this,<br/>and stopped  struggling. Looking into Ranma's eyes, an almost<br/>evil spark seemed  to resonate from within them.</p><p>Akane noticed the daggers being  exchanged. "I'm sorry Ranma.<br/>I'll put P - Chan in my room and  be right back. I'm going to<br/>prove to you that I don't want to hurt  you."</p><p>She left the room, P - Chan still squealing in her  arms.</p><p>Ranma had other ideas, and leapt out the window.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>(Damn Ryoga!) He always manage to show up at the worst  time.<br/>Spoke Ranma-Chan from within her own mind.<p>(Calm  down.) Replied Ranko, who currently had control of the<br/>body they  shared. (I'm actually glad he's here. There's been<br/>something I've  been wanting to do for a long time.)</p><p>(What's that?)</p><p>(I'm  gunna make him change in front of Akane!)</p><p>Ranma was dashing  across the rooftop, her footfalls making no  noise whatsoever.</p><p>She  landed on the small portion of the roof from the first floor,<br/>just  next to Akane's window.</p><p>(You're bucking a stacked deck there.  I thought you had all my<br/>memories. I've been trying to do it  forever, but he can MOVE as<br/>a piggy. Serious agility  there.)</p><p>(True, you have tried, but I have a different  approach, and this<br/>time, there will be no amount of nimble  footwork on his part that<br/>will save him from this!)</p><p>She  placed her forehead against the wall, and gritted her teeth.<br/>In  her mind she was growling to herself, though Ranma watched  and<br/>listened to the events unfold.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane had set P - Chan on the bed, then turned toward the  door.<br/>She seemed lost in thought for a few seconds.<p>Ryoga,  still in piglet form, sat there watching her, when he felt<br/>his  legs go numb. He looked down only to see his front hoofs<br/>begin to  slowly enlarge into his human hands.</p><p>The change began  overtaking him, but the unevenness of it, even<br/>parts of him  reversing mid change, was taking it's toll.</p><p>Piggy skin began  stretching out as the bones underneath morphed<br/>first, then the  skin followed suit. This quickly overloaded his<br/>pain tolerance and  just before he passed out, he let out an<br/>anguished  scream.</p><p>"!"</p><p>Akane  spun on one foot, in time to see a naked Ryoga lying<br/>face-down on  her bed, unconscious, and P - Chan was nowhere to<br/>be found.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Outside, Ranma looked around, then shifted into Male form.  He<br/>jumped onto the roof above Akane's room, took three  paces<br/>forward. "I think right about here!"<p>At the  utterance of those words, the unmistakable sound of Akane<br/>Screaming  "RYOGA, YOU PERVERT!" Echoed out the window. Then<br/>Ryoga,  still dead to the world, smashed through the roof via<br/>Akane's  Chi-Mallet, directly in front of Ranma. Ranma held one<br/>hand up, as  if stiffly waving goodbye as the limp, naked boy<br/>entered into  low-earth-orbit.</p><p>He then waited a few seconds, before jumping  down the hole made<br/>and wrapping his arms around her from  behind.</p><p>"Agh, oh it's you Ranma. I thought it might have  been..."</p><p>"What happened Akane? I went up onto the  roof to think and<br/>suddenly I hear you sending him into  space."</p><p>"I.. Think... no, it's too sick. He couldn't  have possibly.. "</p><p>"What Akane?"</p><p>"Ryoga  was trying to molest P - Chan on my bed, while I was in<br/>the  room!"</p><p>Akane felt hands go limp and it was Ranma's turn  to fall to the<br/>floor, stunned into shock.</p><p>"Ranma, Are  you okay?... Ranma?"</p>
