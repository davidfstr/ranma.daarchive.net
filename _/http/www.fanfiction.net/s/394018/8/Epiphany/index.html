</div><p><b>Epiphany Chapter 8<br/></b><br/>By Tripolar Disorder</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma stood, leaning against the wall in his mental room. Though<br/>he wasn't in control, he had seen everything that had been<br/>happening outside. He had the widest grin on his face. It<br/>threatened to reach both ears if he pulled it tighter.<p>Ranko materialized into being in the center of the room. she<br/>opened her eyes, smiling as she saw him grinning back at her.<p>"I told ya she wouldn't see it. I don't know why, but she<br/>didn't. she never gets it. I'll bet if me and Pops hadn't sat<br/>and explained the curse, then she would think my two sides were<br/>more like you and me."<p>Ranko smirked, "Thank you by the way. I've never had a body of<br/>my own to interact within your world."<p>"Not even going to admit she missed it huh? Don't want admit I<br/>was right?"<p>Ranko's smile waivered slightly, but she tried to maintain it.<p>"Well, you're still on. You can't let Akane's ability to miss<br/>things right in front of her face catch you that off-guard. You<br/>sure haven't got my skills in the art."<p>Ranko scowled, then turned and charged Ranma, only to give him a<br/>hug. "I'll give it back soon, I promise."<p>Ranko faded away, remarking with a smile, "And I'll fill up the<br/>tank before I return it."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane soflty slapped Ranma's cheek a few times until he returned<br/>to conscienceness. "Are you okay?" She asked.<p>"Ugh, did you just say you thought Ryoga was trying to..."<p>"But, P-chan got away though. I can't believe he wanted to ...<br/>ugh, I can't even picture that. I guess he is into pigs even<br/>more than I thought. That is disgusting."<p>Ranma held his head for a few seconds, swearing under her breath.<p>Akane meanwhile, was running her fingers through Ranma's hair<br/>when she realized that said hair was black. She looked over his<br/>shoulder and noticed the lack of breasts.<p>"Uhm, Ranma. How come you changed, but your hair is still dry?"<p>Ranma's head jerked up, looking forward. His eyes had reached<br/>the size of dinner plates. Then, he blinked once then looked<br/>down at her. "uhmm, I had to run into the bathroom. P-chan may<br/>have been Ryoga's victim, but he still bit me on the leg. I<br/>didn't want to get an infection. When the rag touched my leg, I<br/>changed, then you hollered."<p>Akane looked puzzled, but it dawned on her that it could be that<br/>simple.<p>Ranma snickered out loud. "You didn't think that water has to<br/>run over my head to change me, did you? If my feet get wet<br/>outside from a puddle I can change. You are silly sometimes<br/>Akane. It's so cute."<p>Akane looked into his eyes again and saw their warmth. She<br/>pulled him closer and closed her eyes as she leaned against his<br/>shoulder. "I'm sorry Ranma. I guess I just got nosey."<p>"Oh Kami, you think we should write that down. Akane admits<br/>she's nosey. Well, how about that. I guess Hell musta just<br/>dropped below freezing."<p>Ranma was rewarded with a mock-hostile glare. Akane then began<br/>laughing. "You still can't keep from putting your foot in your<br/>mouth, even when you're trying to be nice."<p>She then pushed him off her lap and onto the floor.<p>"What was that for?" Exclaimed Ranma.<p>"You need to go to your room to sleep tonight, unless you want me<br/>to get some cold water and we can share my bed tonight. But we<br/>probably won't get much sleep." Akane said with a grin.<p>Ranma looked into her eyes. Comepletely serious again, he<br/>replied, "Is that what you want Akane?"<p>Akane tried to scowl, but with a smile on her face. "Get going<br/>you pervert, before I pound you flat for even considering that I<br/>was anything but joking."<p>Ranma smiled reluctantly. "I thought so. You had me going<br/>there."<p>With that, he picked himself up and truded out of the room.<p>Akane's smile dropped as soon as the door shut behind him. She<br/>spoke aloud softly. "But what if I had been serious? What if I<br/>really wanted your company tonight?"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The next morning, Ranma and Akane were out in the yard sparring.<br/>It was unlike their usual matches, and quite unlike the morning<br/>ritual attack that he and Genma were accustomed to.<p>He was going slow and pointing out her weaknesses. In turn Akane<br/>was trying to keep her strength in check.<p>Afterwards he carried her inside on his back. When he set her<br/>down, Akane got an evil look about her.<p>"Ranma, you know what I miss about your sparring sessions?" She<br/>grabbed him by the wrist and pulled him back outside. She walked<br/>over to the pond and dunked her hand, still holding his wrist,<br/>under and Ranma closed his eyes and changed.<p>Akane laughed. "You usually come to breakfast as a girl, but<br/>this time you're not all wet."<p>Ranma-chan hopped to her feet and grabbed Akane by the waist.<br/>She lifted her over the pond. "Well, maybe you need to come to<br/>the table wet. You know, right now I wish you had a Jusenkyo<br/>curse of your own."<p>Akane was frantically squealing out loud as she tried to get out<br/>of the redhead's grip. She then realized where she was and<br/>stopped squirming.<p>"You wouldn't dare Ranma. Ok... please?"<p>Meanwhile in Ranma's mind...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Well, so he wishes Akane had a Jusenkyo curse. I can come close<br/>I suppose, since it is his magic now.<p>Here goes...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma started to feel weak. She felt energy moving through her.<br/>Everything started to go black and she felt her feet slipping.<br/>She couldn't hold up Akane and they both fell into the pond.<p>When Akane surfaced she felt just a little different. Her<br/>hearing was the first thing she noticed. Everything was a little<br/>louder and as she turned her head, she could tell where just<br/>about every sound was coming from.<p>She only half registered all of this as she noticed Ranma-chan<br/>unmoving, floating face down next to her.<p>She grabbed Ranma, and jumped out of the pool. She landed next<br/>to the house and was surprised at how far she went.<p>Nodoka came into the living room to see a drenched Akane holding<br/>an equally drenched Ranma-chan in her arms.<p>Nodoka was at her daughter's side immediately. She noticed<br/>Ranma-chan was still breathing. She seemed to be asleep.<p>Without looking up Nodoka asked. "What happened Akane?"<p>Akane replied. "We were having a little fun out over the pond<br/>and Ranma passed out and we fell in."<p>Nodoka looked up and her face seemed to lose all color. "Are you<br/>alright Akane?" Said Nodoka in a shaking voice.<p>Akane looked confused. "Other then being all wet, I feel fine.<br/>Why do you ask?"<p>Nodoka put her arm on Akane's shoulder. "I think you need a look<br/>in the mirror, Akane. You seem to have grown... ears."<p>Akane put her hand against the side of her head. "No I haven't<br/>they didn't get... wait, what happened to my ears?"<p>She was patting the side of her head frantically, when Nodoka<br/>took her wrist and placed it on the furry cat-ear on top of her<br/>head.<p>Akane patted her hand around and realization struck her. She<br/>proceeded to pass out.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-chan was standing in her mind's room. "Okay, Ko-chan how<br/>come I passed out?"<p>The mirror image of Ranma-chan emerged from the wall. "I am<br/>sorry about that Ranma. That took more energy than I thought it<br/>would." Said Ranko as she stepped onto the floor. "Don't worry.<br/>We just need to recharge our batteries. We'll be good as new in<br/>about an hour."<p>Ranma-chan glared at her. "What took more energy than you<br/>thought?"<p>"Why giving Akane a Jusenkyo curse, just like you wanted." She<br/>was smiling with a truly evil grin.<p>"WHAT? YOU DIDN'T!" Ranma-chan was nearly screaming at<br/>Ranko.<p>Ranko laughed. "This is your magic now and that is what you<br/>wanted. You aren't capable of giving her an actual curse, but<br/>she has an adorable pair of ears and a tail."<p>"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! YOU GAVE HER A CURSE? UNBELIEVABLE!"<p>"Calm down Ranma. There is no reason to yell at me about it.<br/>You can remove it as soon as you wake up." Replied Ranko. She<br/>continued, "Though I think she looks better with them."<p>Ranma-chan "Just because I asked? You did it because I asked?"<p>"Wished, Ranma. If you had not wished it out loud you would not<br/>even have tempted me. But THAT, I could not resist."<p>Ranma-chan seemed to be calming down. "Well I guess I will have<br/>to tell her about being able to control the curse. Then change<br/>her back."<p>"You could. There are other ways. You could torture her for a<br/>few days." Ranko giggled.<p>Ranma gritted his teeth. "No, I don't want her that mad at me.<br/>I'm already dead meat from this."<p>Ranma-chan sat down with crossed legs and Ranko mimicked him<br/>while sitting across from him.<p>They continued to look at each other for several silent minutes<br/>until Ranko spoke up. "I know you're mad at me, but I think this<br/>could be a good thing."<p>"How?" Growled Ranma-chan.<p>"They are cat ears and tail. Akane could help you with your only<br/>real fear."<p>"C-C-Cat ears? No... anything but those. How could you?"<br/>Stammered Ranma-chan.<p>"Hot water will change her back, and cold water will make her a<br/>cat-girl. She has one advantage in the fact that she is not a<br/>water magnet." Replied Ranko.<p>Ranko looked up suddenly, toward the ceiling. Time to wake up<br/>Ranma-chan, and you better figure out what you are going to say.<p>With that, the room went dark.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-chan opened her eyes. She was lying on a futon on the<br/>floor. She could see Nabiki, Nodoka and Kasumi sitting around<br/>her. She turned her head to the left and saw Akane on a futon<br/>next to her. Her eyes were still closed and a damp cloth was on<br/>her forehead.<p>Ranma-chan noticed her ears. They were sticking out of her hair<br/>near the top of her head. Short and furry in a brown and tan<br/>marbled pattern. She did have to admit that, despite the<br/>obvious resemblance to a cat, she did look quite cute.<p>Ranma-chan turned her attention to Nodoka clearing her throat.<br/>"Ranma-dear, do you have any idea what happened to Akane?"<p>Ranma-chan felt her face getting red. "Yes Mom, I think I can<br/>explain. But, can I tell you alone? I feel embarrassed."<p>Nodoka nodded. She helped Ranma-chan up and they went down to<br/>the furo. Ranma-chan stopped and came back. "Um, after Akane<br/>wakes up, can you have her meet me and mom in the furo? I hope<br/>she won't be mad at me."<p>Nabiki snickered and pointed to the roof. "You will be lucky if<br/>she only knocks you into orbit."<p>Ranma-chan paled then turned around and left.<p>Akane woke up shortly after. Her eyes slowly opened. Kasumi<br/>asked her. "How are you feeling, Akane?"<p>She turned toward Kasumi. "I just had a strange dream that I got<br/>turned into a cat."<p>Nabiki coughed and handed her a mirror. "It wasn't a dream sis,<br/>and you have a tail too."<p>Akane was holding the mirror tightly, as she could see a pair of<br/>ears on top of her head. She could feel them as she flexed them.<p>The glass surface on the mirror began cracking, so she handed it<br/>to Kasumi and sat up slowly. She put her hands on her head and<br/>touched them. They were soft, furry, and sensitive to touch.<br/>She then turned behind her to see the tail sticking out of her<br/>practice gi.<p>She tried to make it move and it did. It started curling up<br/>toward her. She put her hand on it, and could feel her touch.<p>Akane laughed once. She stood up slowly. The new sensations<br/>were calming her. She could hear and feel the cool breeze<br/>flowing through the house. It tickled her ears and she rubbed<br/>them lightly with her fingertips.<p>Nabiki pointed toward the furo. "Ranma says she knows what<br/>happened to you, and she and Nodoka are waiting in the furo for<br/>you.<p>Akane nodded. With her mind set, she stormed her way to the<br/>bathroom door.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Meanwhile...<p>"Ok, dear. We are alone. Now what happened to Akane?"<p>Ranma sighed as she sat on one of the wash buckets. "You know<br/>how I can change forms at will now?"<p>Nodoka nodded and Ranma-chan shifted into male form. "Well, I<br/>want to tell you how that happened."<p>Nodoka listened to her son's story of how his curse merged with<br/>him and was now part of him.<p>Ranma had watched his mother and noted her reaction was still<br/>calm, and was relived to see that.<p>"The reason I decided not to tell you how I knew, is because then<br/>Akane would hear it, then she go and tell Ryoga, thinking he's<br/>just that Damn P-Chan. He'd come clobbering me endlessly<br/>thinking I had a cure, which I really don't."<p>After he finished his mother asked "so... your curse magic, whom<br/>has a mind of her own, heard you wish Akane had a curse and<br/>fulfilled it?"<p>"Yeah mom, that about explains it. She said the magic is mine<br/>now to do with what I want. I didn't have enough for a full<br/>curse, so she did a tail and ears."<p>"Ears, I might add, that are very capable of picking up mumbling<br/>conversations in ajoining rooms." Interrupted Akane as she<br/>opened the door and walked in.<p>Ranma started to sweat.<p>"How long were you behind the door Akane?" Asked Ranma, shakily.<p>"Long enough."<p>Akane walked over and stood in front of him. He saw her giant<br/>mallet materialize in her hands.<p>"Now Ranma, the only thing keeping me from being really mad at<br/>you is that I promised you I wouldn't. But I want to know why<br/>you never told me you could change at will, or that Ryoga WAS<br/>P-Chan?<p>Ranma sighed. "I was the one that accidentally knocked him off<br/>the cliff and into the spring. He said it was all my fault and<br/>made me promise not to tell you, and he has been using me since."<p>Akane started to cry. She fell to her knees. The mallet<br/>impacted the floor tiles, it's holder unable to hold it. "And<br/>all the times I caught you in my room at night?"<p>Ranma nodded.<p>Nodoka decided it was time to leave the two of them alone. She<br/>stepped out and shut the furo door behind her.<p>Akane choked out. "You were trying to get Ryoga out of my bed,<br/>and I called you a pervert for it."<p>Ranma nodded again.<p>Akane's mallet disappeared and she threw herself at Ranma. "I'm<br/>so sorry Ranma."<p>Ranma was bowled to the floor under the force of her impact.<br/>Still crying, Akane tried to continue her apology. "Ryoga has<br/>been using you all along, just like you said to Kasumi and I<br/>never saw it."<p>He wrapped his arms around her and she buried her face into his<br/>chest. She continued to cry for several minutes.<p>She finally lifted her head back up to look at him. "Did you<br/>cause him to change last night?"<p>Ranma nodded again.<p>Akane started to laugh, even with tears in her eyes. She<br/>sniffled her nose and Ranma handed her a tissue.<p>"I'll bet you were just hitting yourself that I was so dense I<br/>couldn't see it." Akane said with a smile on her face. She blew<br/>her nose as she listened to his reply.<p>She buried her face into his chest for a moment, before lifting<br/>herself off him.<p>"Alright then. As my punishment for being dense as a brick. I<br/>accept your curse upon me. It's the least I can do."<p>"You're not mad?"<p>"Not at you Ranma. Not at you. I am quickly realizing how much<br/>I was blaming you for, that wasn't your fault at all."<p>"Never again." She said, and proudly left the room with a smile.</p>
