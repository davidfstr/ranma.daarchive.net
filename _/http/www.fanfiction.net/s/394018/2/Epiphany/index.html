</div><p>Epiphany Chapter 2<p>By Tripolar Disorder<p>Revision 2.23</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka was crying. Crying because she was holding her son. Her<br/>little boy had finally returned to her. She was crying because<br/>she was happy.<p>Ranma-chan was also crying. Her mother didn't care about her<br/>curse, her mother wanted her.<p>Ranma kept thinking over what Nodoka said. She wished he had<br/>never left. Everything that Genma had put him through might not<br/>have happened. It made Ranma-chan only cry even harder into<br/>Nodoka's arms.<p>Nodoka kept holding Ranma-chan until she calmed down. then she<br/>held the redhead out at arms length so she could give her a good<br/>look over.<p>"My Son.. er, daughter. I'm so happy to have you back. I'm<br/>sorry your father scared you so much that you couldn't face me."<p>Ranma-chan couldn't say a word, only reached out and pulled<br/>herself back into her mother's embrace, clutching tighter. She<br/>wasn't audibly crying anymore, but tears still came down her<br/>cheeks.<p>Kasumi continued to sit in front of the pair. "I assume you'd<br/>like to know why your son is a girl."<p>Nodoka looked down, and Ranma-chan looked back up at her. She<br/>stared into those deep pools of blue and could see the emotions<br/>within her eyes. She saw the pain and suffering, and she knew<br/>that Ranma-chan was begging to be accepted.<p>"It can wait. I'm just happy to have you back. Whatever my<br/>bastard husband did, I can't imagine what caused this. It's<br/>obvious that we need each other. I can listen to the details<br/>another day."<p>Ranma-chan looked up and managed a smile. "Actually, it's not<br/>as bad as it looks, I'm not a girl completely."<p>Nodoka looked back down at her sniffling bundle. "I'm not sure<br/>I understand."<p>Kasumi decided to tell the story. "Ranma changes into a girl<br/>when splashed with cold water, and changes back when splashed<br/>with hot water. It's a magical curse that he got while training<br/>in china."<p>Ranma-chan wiped her eyes. "It doesn't hurt or nuthin' Mom. It<br/>happens so often, I almost don't notice it."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Sitting outside the house on one of the rocks circling the Koi<br/>pond, and within hearing range, but seemly hidden from view from<br/>everyone inside, a single person watched the events intently.<p>Thinking to them self, (finally, after all this time. She's got<br/>her mother, and she's finally loved. Dammit, if I had known<br/>that killing Genma would have done it, I would've done it myself<br/>long ago.)<p>The invisible person continued to look on.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki came out of the kitchen with the kettle. "This time<br/>Saotome, it's on me."<p>Nodoka noted that Ranma was mentally changing, like she was<br/>putting on a mask. Her slight smile disappeared, and her eyes<br/>seemed to lose their glow.<p>Nabiki held out the kettle and poured hot water over Ranma-chan.<p>Nodoka was stunned at the speed of the transformation. Ranma's<br/>hair darkened till it was a deep black. Ranma's breasts shrunk<br/>into well developed pectoral muscles. A few inches in height<br/>completed the transformation. His face was solem and<br/>expressionless.<p>Ranma stood up and turned to give his mother a better view.<br/>Nodoka smiled. "You grew up just like I had imagined." She put<br/>her hand on his shoulder.<p>She was about to suggest that They all sit down and Ranma tell<br/>her about his training trip, when she was interrupted as Shampoo<br/>stepped in through the open shoji doors. She didn't destroy any<br/>walls as she came in, and she was acting cautious.<p>Shampoo looked over the scene, noting the bloodshot eyes from<br/>both Nodoka and Ranma. She turned to Nodoka. "Nihao<br/>Saotome-san. Is pleasure to meet you."<p>Shampoo knelt down in front of Ranma. "Am sorry hear Panda-man<br/>dead, but am happy you find mother. Will leave alone for while.<br/>Need time to mourn and have bond time with mother. Arien is<br/>lucky to have mother."<p>With that, Shampoo bowed and took off.<p>Nabiki looked at Ranma. "That was different."<p>Kasumi quickly hid a small smile.<p>Nodoka turned toward him. "Ranma, is there anything else that<br/>you should be telling me about?"<p>Kasumi saw this a cue to brew some tea, so she went into the<br/>kitchen.<p>Ranma sighed. He figured he'd better start explaining the kind<br/>of routine that occurs in Nerima. It was going to be a long<br/>day.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Later that evening, after hearing all about Ranma's life on the<br/>road, Nodoka was in the kitchen. Kasumi was off at Doctor<br/>Tofu's clinic. She had said it was to return a book, but her<br/>eyes had told a different story.<p>So she was getting started on dinner when her thoughts drifted<br/>to the last visit at the Tendo's. She had watched with<br/>fascination as Ranko had turned the making of a salad into<br/>a martial arts demonstration.<p>She now knew the truth and it made her both happy and sad.<p>Nodoka had grown quite fond of the strange girl. She was always<br/>happy to see her, and always ready to help out. She had forced<br/>Ranma into wearing a dress and act more "Feminine". Then<br/>giggled, remembering how she had made the panda eat Akane's<br/>cooking.<p>(Ranma just wanted to see me. And risked exposing his secret.)<br/>She remembered when the hot water pipe burst in the kitchen. It<br/>made her smile to think how creative he son had to be.<p>As she was getting out the ingredients she was still thinking<br/>how helpful Ranko had been in the kitchen.<p>"I almost wish Ranko was here. She was always so helpful." She<br/>said out loud, not talking to anyone. She just didn't realize<br/>that someone heard her.<p>Ranma was about to walk into the kitchen when he stopped at<br/>hearing what Nodoka said. He silently turned around and dashed<br/>up to his room.<p>Nodoka was getting started on the stove when she noticed<br/>movement out of the corner of her eye.<p>Standing in the doorway was Ranma-chan. She was in the same<br/>house dress and apron that she had been wearing the last time.<br/>Her hands were clasped together in front of her.<p>"Can I help you make dinner Auntie?" Came a slightly trembling<br/>voice."<p>"Of course dear, why don't you ... Oh Kami!"<p>Nodoka dropped the wooden spoon she was holding, ran over and<br/>wrapped her arms around Ranma-chan. Tears forming and<br/>streaking down her cheeks.<p>Ranma-chan was shaking and Nodoka felt it, she swept the girl up<br/>off the floor and had her sitting sideways on her knees. Arms<br/>were now exchanged and Nodoka winced at the strength of the<br/>tight embrace her female son had around her chest.<p>After several minutes, she could feel Ranma calm down, so she<br/>decided to speak. "You don't need to pretend anymore. You are<br/>my little prince... princess too, and nothing will make me<br/>change my mind."<p>Ranma-chan bit her lip. "Do you mind if I be your princess<br/>tonight? I wanna help with supper an' I promise to watch any<br/>veggies first."<p>Nodoka wiped her eyes, and chuckled a little. She let go of<br/>Ranma-chan. They looked into each other's eyes. Nodoka saw<br/>nothing but unconditional love staring back at her in her<br/>child's eyes.<p>Ranma-chan picked up the spoon off the floor, and held it out<br/>toward Nodoka. "You dropped this...Mom."<p>She looked toward Ranma. "You don't have to remain a girl if<br/>you want to help me. You can upstairs and change quickly."<p>Ranma seemed to ponder this a moment, before smiling and shaking<br/>her head. "Nah, I'm already dressed to help. And your pot is<br/>boilin' over."<p>"EEP!" Was all Nodoka could say as she grabbed the spoon and<br/>dropped it in the sink. She took down another from it's wall<br/>hook and tended to the stove.<p>Soon Nodoka and Ranma were busy making the meal. Instructing<br/>her charge on the proper way to make a salad, and what needed<br/>to be added to the soup. She noted that Ranma-chan was smiling,<br/>a genuine natural smile. Nodoka made sure to address her child<br/>correctly and the rest of the meal prep went without any other<br/>incident.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>That night Nodoka was trying to get some sleep on the Sofa<br/>downstairs, but she just couldn't get to sleep. Her instincts<br/>were telling her something was wrong. Very wrong.<p>She crept upstairs silently. She stopped at the door to Ranma's<br/>room. She thought she heard a weak voice on the other side. It<br/>sounded like a small child crying.<p>Nodoka slid open the door a crack to see inside. Her eyes<br/>strained to see the contents.<p>Ranma-chan was on the floor curled into the tightest of fetal<br/>balls. Her arms were protecting her neck and her face, and she<br/>was shaking from head to toe. It was obvious that she was<br/>crying and at one point she heard the girl weakly scream out,<br/>"Momma, help me!"<p>Nodoka stood there shocked at what she saw. Her heart tried to<br/>tear itself from her chest.<p>It took more time for am eyelash to flutter, then for the door<br/>to be thrown open with enough force to knock it off it's tracks,<br/>and for Nodoka to rush to Ranma's side.<p>As she entered the room her eyes scanned every inch, there was no<br/>one else there, nor signs of entry. Ranma was obviously trying<br/>to protect herself from multiple blows. Nodoka realized that<br/>Ranma-chan was having a nightmare. She tried to wake the girl,<br/>but it only served to make Ranma cry out again.<p>She lifted the girl into her arms and set her in her lap. She<br/>snaked her arms in around Ranma-chan's waist, and began rocking<br/>her crying bundle, repeating over and over that she was there<br/>and that Ranma was safe.<p>Ranma-chan stayed curled up for almost an hour, crying for most<br/>of that time. As she started to relax and calm down, she<br/>stopped shielding her body and instead put her arms around her<br/>mother.<p>At no time did she seem to wake up, and instead continued to<br/>sleep in Nodoka's arms. She continued to hold on wondering what<br/>was happening to her child.<p>Her question was answered when Kasumi appeared in the hallway.<br/>She had moved past the broken remains of the door and looked in<br/>upon the scene and deduced what had transpired.<p>"She was having the nightmare again wasn't she? She was<br/>shielding herself and calling out for you."<p>The last statement came out like a question, as if another<br/>response was suggested. Nodoka also picked this up, but didn't<br/>give it away. "How did you know dear?"<p>Kasumi sighed then walked into the room. She sat down before<br/>the Saotome matriarch.<p>"When Ranma was six years old, Genma dug a pit in the ground<br/>near where they were camping which he filled with house cats<br/>that he had stolen from that area. He then wrapped Ranma in<br/>fish sausages and fish paste and tossed him into the pit."<p>"It was supposed to be technique for an unbeatable art called<br/>the Neko-Ken. All it did was scar Ranma, both emotionally and<br/>physically. He is now so afraid of cats, that even the mere<br/>sight of one causes him to become hysterical and run away<br/>screaming."<p>"Genma tried to get Ranma over the fear of cats by throwing him<br/>back into the pit, day after day. Ranma couldn't remember<br/>exactly how many times he was thrown into the pit, but we think<br/>it was every day for about a month."<p>"I have seen Ranma relive that experience in his nightmares too<br/>many times to count. He cries out as the cats bite and claw<br/>him. He calls first for his father, then to you, to save him<br/>from the pain."<p>"I wonder what Genma was actually thinking as he heard his son<br/>crying out for his help, even though Genma threw him in there."<p>Kasumi had lowered her head while talking and when she brought<br/>it up she noticed that Nodoka's face had gotten quite pale.<p>"Whenever I held her, to tried and comfort her, she continued<br/>to call for you. I always ended up waking her up to get over<br/>it. But tonight it seems Ranma finally got her wish."<p>Nodoka lowered her head. "I never should have let them go.<br/>What other barbaric things did Genma do? I'm still surprised<br/>that he, er she isn't completely insane. Hearing this I can't<br/>fathom what you four aren't telling me."<p>At this Kasumi winced. Nodoka nodded. "I had a feeling that<br/>Ranma's curse wasn't the only thing that he has been through.<br/>I want you to tell me.." She looked down at her sleeping<br/>bundle, now quiet and relaxed. "...Tomorrow. You can tell me<br/>tomorrow."<p>"I promise Auntie, but I will leave you alone now."<p>With that Nodoka was left to comfort Ranma-chan again. She<br/>continued to hold her the rest of the night.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>From across the street, the invisible figure looked toward the<br/>house and the closed window. Satisfied that intervention would<br/>not be needed tonight, the figure took off.</p>
