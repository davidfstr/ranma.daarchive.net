</div><p>Epiphany Chapter 9<p>By Tripolar Disorder.<p>A new day, and a new curse, and old fears. Part One</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane was sitting on the examining table in Doctor Tofu's office.<p>Ranma-Chan was sitting across from her. She was currently<br/>watching Akane's tail as it rhythmically curled up and down.<p>Tofu came back in with a folder in his hands. "Well Akane, I<br/>have to say that you are in fine shape, despite your new look.<br/>However I did notice a couple items that I think you should be<br/>aware of. This curse Ranma gave you seems to have done a bit of<br/>sculpting, though I'm not really sure why."<p>As he said this Ranma-Chan began to pale. Akane noticed this and<br/>her ears easily picked up the redhead's nervous gulp.<p>Tofu noticed this as well. "I would not worry Ranma, these are<br/>minor things that Akane will have to adjust to in her cursed<br/>form, much like the adjustments you have to make when you are a<br/>girl."<p>Ranma-Chan looked back at Tofu, completely lost as to what he was<br/>referring to.<p>Akane began to giggle. "You girl form is a bit more top-heavy,<br/>isn't it Ranma?"<p>Tofu had to start laughing as Ranma was still digesting this<br/>information.<p>Understanding finally hit the redhead. "Oh you mean my breasts."<br/>She put her finger on one. "Yeah, I gotta balance different."<p>Akane had to smile as she shook her head. "You are so silly<br/>sometimes Ranma. It is so cute."<p>Ranma-Chan began blushing. Meanwhile, Akane turned back to the<br/>doctor. "What adjustments, Tofu?" She asked.<p>"First of all, I'm not sure how, but you seem to have greater<br/>control of your chi moving through your legs. That may explain<br/>how easily you got out of the pond earlier.<p>Your arms are also just a touch weaker. In fact I would say they<br/>are matching your legs. You seem to be more even in muscle<br/>distribution.<p>You may also find yourself more agile in this form Akane.<br/>It is difficult to tell at this point, but you may notice it<br/>after a few days."<p>"Okay Doc, Can we go? I'm hungry." Said Ranma-Chan.<p>Tofu nodded and showed them out. "Take care you two."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-Chan was walking a few feet in front of Akane. She seemed<br/>to be trying to keep distance between them.<p>"Ranma, is there something wrong?" Asked Akane. Her ears<br/>twitching to hear Ranma's breathing.<p>"Uhm, no Akane. I'm fine."<p>"What's wrong then? You have been jumpy this morning. What is<br/>your prob..."<p>Ranma-Chan stopped. Still facing away from Akane, she spoke.<br/>"I am scared, Akane. I'm scared of you. My fear of cats is<br/>taking over and you are what is causing it. I can't believe she<br/>had to give you that curse."<p>Akane watched as Ranma put her arms around herself and began<br/>shivering. This is hurting her.<p>"Ranma, can you force the change? So I am normal? And less<br/>painfully then your number on Ryoga?"<p>Ranma nodded. "I'll try Akane, but I have to be in contact with<br/>you."<p>Akane wrapped her arms around Ranma-Chan, and the redhead<br/>shuddered, and then closed her eyes. Akane felt her hearing<br/>become muted, and felt like she had cotton in her ears.<p>As this happened, Akane noticed Ranma starting to collapse.<br/>Akane swept Ranma-Chan's feet out from under her, and cradled her<br/>in her arms. Then she began sprinting the last block home.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi and Nodoka were sipping tea at the table when Akane<br/>brought Ranma-Chan inside the patio shoji doors.<p>"Oneechan, Auntie, come quick! Something is happening to Ranma!"<p>Sure enough, Ranma-Chan was shaking and curling up into a ball.<p>Kasumi was the first to respond. "Akane, he is having an attack<br/>like I told you about. You need to ..."<p>Akane interrupted. "I am the reason he is having an attack, I<br/>have to get away from him!"<p>Nodoka took Ranma-Chan out of Akane's arms. She held her<br/>daughter while Kasumi got a blanket and wrapped it around her.<p>Akane was curled up in the corner. Her knees nearly hiding her<br/>face.<p>"What happened Akane?" Asked Nodoka.<p>"Her fear of cats was kicking in, and my curse was triggering it.<br/>She couldn't even be near me. I asked her to change me back and<br/>doing it made her..."<p>Akane was starting to cry. Kasumi and Nodoka could hear the pain<br/>in her sobbing.<p>Ranma-Chan soon started to return to reality. She looked around<br/>and saw what was going on. "Akane, please don't be mad at me."<p>Akane stiffened. "Mad at you? No, I am not mad at you. I can't<br/>be mad at you, not for this." She slid up the wall until she was<br/>standing up. "I am mad at someone else, for all the things he<br/>did to you. But I am not going to let him win Ranma."<p>"What do you mean Akane?" Asked Ranma-Chan.<p>"What I mean is, that I am going to get you over your fear of<br/>cats."<p>Another nervous gulp. "I was afraid you were going to say that."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka, Tofu, Kasumi and Ranma-Chan were in the Dojo. Nodoka and<br/>Tofu stood against the wall, and Kasumi was holding Ranma-Chan<br/>from behind as they stood in the middle of the floor.<p>Ranma-Chan was taking deep breaths. She also had her eyes closed<br/>as she was doing her best to remain calm.<p>"Ok, Ranma. When Akane comes in you have to look at her. If you<br/>want to be rid of your fear, you must face it." Tofu relayed.<p>Ranma-Chan nodded. "I d-d-don't wanna be afraid of Akane. I-I<br/>love her."<p>Just then the Shoji door opened and Akane-neko stepped in. She<br/>was wearing a bathing suit, which now sported a hole for her<br/>tail.<p>She set the Thermos bottle that she was carrying down and turned<br/>to look straight at Ranma-Chan.<p>The redhead was shaking and tears were coming out her eyes. "I<br/>w-w-will not be s-scared." Akane could barely see the look in<br/>Ranma's eyes, but glimpses told her that Ranma-Chan was trying<br/>her best not to freak out."<p>Akane thought about how fearless Ranma always seemed, and his<br/>courage to face any opponent. How this same person looked so<br/>terrified, and over something such as lovable house cats.<p>She then noticed Ranma began struggling out of Kasumi's grip.<br/>"I-I-I c-c-can't do this. I c-could hurt all of you."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Inside Ranma's mind, Ranko stood in a braced stance, trying to<br/>hold herself against the torrents of pain and fear that were<br/>trying to take over.<p>As she stood there, covering her face from the winds, she could<br/>not understand why he had not gotten this bad in the furo that<br/>morning.<p>She was on top of him this morning, and her ears nearly in his<br/>face, what was going on? How come he didn't react then?</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane stood there, Ranma-Chan had stopped moving. Her head<br/>hanging low as Kasumi held her in her grip. Ranma-Chan suddenly<br/>looked up into Akane's eyes. "I... love... you... Akane.<br/>I... want... to... show... you."<p>Ranma-Chan gritted her teeth. She stiffened and Tofu felt an<br/>energy escaping the girl. She is using every ounce of internal<br/>strength to fight it. If her aura becomes more powerful, it<br/>could burn Kasumi.<p>Ranma-Chan's breathing was heavy, but through gritted teeth she<br/>spoke. "Akane, please come closer."<p>Akane hesitantly took a step forward.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranko was barely holding her own against the winds when she felt<br/>something else, another force from out in front of Ranma.<p>Ye Gods, That's it. It was Akane. He could feel her emotions<br/>and as strong as her moods are, he didn't even notice the cat, he<br/>was too busy worrying about getting clobbered by the mallet.<p>As Ranko reached out to touch Akane's presence. Shit, but she<br/>isn't helping him now.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-Chan stopped shivering for a moment. "Akane, I-I can<br/>f-feel how n-nervous you are. I c-can actually f-feel it."<p>Akane was shocked, she stopped, balancing on her heel, ready to<br/>retreat quickly.<p>Akane stopped. "So I am making him worse? Because I am not<br/>calm?"<p>Tofu nodded. "You need to calm yourself Akane. You need to put<br/>away your fear of his problem, you are only adding to whatever is<br/>happening in his mind."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranko could hear it, and the storm was getting worse. The<br/>doctor is right, maybe this link can help. Not in the way he<br/>thinks though.<p>She felt Akane getting closer, and Akane's thoughts became<br/>clearer.<p>As the howling winds and the echoing pain got worse, Ranko could<br/>no longer hold on. I need some help here and I know just where<br/>to get it.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane could see Ranma-Chan eyes. They were full of tears. But<br/>suddenly she watched them glaze over.<p>Ranma-Chan stopped shaking, and Tofu felt the aura die down.<br/>Everyone gasped as they thought the cat had taken over.<p>Ranma-Chan's head slumped forward for a moment then came back up.<p>Tofu felt a new presence, however. One unlike his patient. "Who<br/>are you, and why have you possessed Ranma?"<p>She turned toward the questioner. "I am Ranko, formerly Ranma's<br/>curse magic. You must promise that no matter what, that Akane<br/>and Ranma do not separate."<p>Before Tofu could question Ranko, she had turned to Akane. "I am<br/>sorry Akane, but I need your help in a way you will not<br/>understand until I show you."<p>With that, she lunged at Akane, breaking Kasumi's grip and<br/>knocking both girls to the ground.<p>Tofu ran over to the pile. He noticed that Ranma-Chan had a<br/>locking grip around Akane's chest and that both girls were out<br/>cold.<p>He stood up and turned to Nodoka. "Ranko has bridged the gap<br/>between them. Akane may be inside Ranma's mind."<p>Kasumi gave the "Oh my!" Nodoka asked. "Is there anything we<br/>can do about it?"<p>Tofu nodded. "Ranko said not to separate them, and I will stay<br/>here to make sure that it does not happen. It could be fatal to<br/>either of them."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane looked around. She was standing in a cold, dark desert of<br/>gray sand that seemed endless. Limitless gray with little light<br/>surrounded her on all sides. A foul wind blew around her and<br/>made her shiver. She felt her ears fold backward and her tail<br/>wrapped around her. It made her feel a little warmer.<p>She sensed someone behind her and turned. It was a female Ranma.<p>"Ranma, where are we?"<p>The girl sighed. "I am not Ranma, I am Ranma's curse. Call me<br/>Ranko."<p>As Akane understood what had happened in the Dojo, she asked.<br/>"So this is Ranma's mind?"<p>Ranko nodded. "This is it. The total expanse of darkness caused<br/>by a life of utter pain and loneliness."<p>Akane shivered. Ranko saw this and shivered with her. "Consider<br/>yourself lucky Akane. You mind is a bit warmer and I would<br/>personally love to be there right now, but I need your help."<p>Akane puzzled. "What do you need my help with?"<p>Ranko took her hand. "I have something to show you."<p>Akane found herself being lead across the vast windy planes.<br/>Ranko sighed as she walked. "A few minutes ago, I could not even<br/>stand up because the wind of pain was so strong. That is when I<br/>figured out that you can help and I took over Ranma to get<br/>you."<p>Akane had tears in her eyes. "I never realized that Ranma was<br/>this way. That he was tortured in his own mind. I would never<br/>have hurt him. I never realized how alone he felt."<p>Ranko turned and put her arms around Akane. "I know hon, his<br/>life has been much worse then even you knew, until now. But with<br/>your help, maybe we can change it."<p>Akane collected herself, and Ranko continued onward. "Where are<br/>we headed Ranko?"<p>Ranko giggled. "We are looking for Ranma's sensitive side. It<br/>is very small and I don't remember exactly where he left it<br/>last."<p>"Can you tell me what it looks like, so I can help you look?"<br/>Asked Akane.<p>"It looks like a chibi-Ranma-chan. About the same size as a<br/>toddler type too."<p>Suddenly Ranko tripped and Akane found herself tumbling to the<br/>ground after Ranko.<p>Ranko swore. "Kuso, there it is." She spun around on her knees<br/>and brushed off a stone statue of a chibi-Ranma-chan. In the<br/>center of it, a dim glow seemed to resonate from where a heart<br/>should have been.<p>Akane helped Ranko pull it out of the dune of sand it was buried<br/>under. They set it upright. Akane swore she noticed the stone<br/>eyes followed her, as she walked around it.<p>"It is really weird, isn't it Ranko?"<p>Ranko swore again. "Please refrain from insulting it. That's<br/>partially why it looks this way in the first place."<p>"You have to understand Akane, This entire place is merely a<br/>physical representation of Ranma's mind. Everything you see is<br/>metaphorical for part of himself."<p>"Ranma was forced to suppress his feelings. So you could say he<br/>incased them in stone. He was never able to express himself<br/>because of it. But you and his mother have helped to break the<br/>stone."<p>"Then why does it look like this again?" Asked Akane, still<br/>circling the statue.<p>"Because you both are helping to rebuild it again."<p>"I'm confused."<p>"You should be. You're sending Ranma mixed messages, and they<br/>are confusing him as much as I am to you now."<p>Ranko smiled as she watched the expression on Akane's face.<br/>"Allow me to explain."<p>"Genma and his training trip. I barely have to explain this.<br/>First off, he convinced young Ranma that his mother hated him,<br/>that she sent him away because he wasn't fit in her eyes."<p>"Then Genma's taunting and goading, though making him a stoic<br/>fighter, forced him to bottle up his emotions. Crying wasn't<br/>allowed, even when the bastard stole away his food and made him<br/>go to sleep hungry."<p>"But it all builds up, and down here it collected together into<br/>this little boy who is always suffering and scared and may never<br/>really grow up. Blocking these emotions created a skin of stone,<br/>see?"<p>"Alright."<p>"Then I enter this picture." Gestured Ranko to herself. "I<br/>should explain the events of that day..."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Moments after Ranma was cursed, deep within his mind.<p>Ranko, completely nude, wandered around in a foggy pitch-black<br/>darkness. She had this strange grin.<p>"Why are you here?" Spoke a clear voice behind her, causing her<br/>to spin to face a little boy. The blackish cloud seemed to have<br/>parted to allow them to look at each other eye to eye.<p>"You're much older outside, did you fall into the man spring<br/>first?"<p>Again, the boy repeated his question. "Why are you here?"<p>"Pushy sort, aren't you. Well, I am part of your brand-new<br/>curse. This is what you look like on the outside right now.<br/>what do you think of it? Not too over the top?"<p>"Why are you here?" asked the boy again, this time his voice<br/>betraying a hint of frustration or anger.<p>"Well, if you must know, my job is to 'Guide' your actions just a<br/>touch, in order to make you change more often, and especially<br/>when it's least convenient."<p>"Why?" The boy's tone was calm.<p>"Because it's my job. Oh, and now that we've met, do you mind<br/>terribly if I redecorate? This place is depressing. I think<br/>splashes of pink will fit right in with your new female body."<p>"I can't let you do that?"<p>"Really? Why not?"<p>"Because I am trying to make momma love me again. I have to be a<br/>man."<p>"Well, then I have news for you, tiny tot. You're curse gives me<br/>a bit of control over that, and if that is your goal in life,<br/>then I'm going to make your life a living hell."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Then what happened Ranko?"<p>They were sitting on the ground in front of the statue. Ranko<br/>was having difficulty continuing, while Akane tried to comfort<br/>her.<p>"Ranma proved me wrong." She replied as she looked into Akane's<br/>face, tears streaming from her eyes. "He said that if I thought<br/>I could make his life hell, I had to see something. He told me<br/>that I had no idea what hell was."<p>"Then what?" Questioned Akane.<p>"He opened the floodgates."<p>"What?"<p>"He linked himself to me, and all of his pain and suffering now<br/>had a new outlet and I was unprepared for the deluge that he<br/>inflicted upon me. That little boy did the most hurtful thing he<br/>could think of, but in doing so he ceased to exist and merged<br/>with me. Suddenly I was younger, just like this statue. I was<br/>then struck with the full force of Ranma's life."<p>Ranko wiped tear her cheek, and Akane put her arms around her.<br/>Ranko calmed down after a moment, then continued.<p>"I cannot tell you what that experience was like Akane. I<br/>thought my head was being ripped apart. I saw in the span of<br/>mere moments, his entire life. I felt the claws, the whips, the<br/>burns, everything. I tried to get everything off me, but I found<br/>that it was useless. I was in more pain then I could possibly<br/>imagine. Worst part was, is I deserved it."<p>"I tried to find a single happy memory to hide within, but I<br/>could not find anything. I saw his dream, his happy place,<br/>where his mind would run to when everything overwhelmed him. He<br/>endured all of this pain because he wanted it to end and he could<br/>be home and warm and loved. His happy place was in Nodoka's<br/>arms, just a little boy again. I saw for a moment, this oasis in<br/>the middle of all of his suffering, but it shattered as his fear<br/>took over and I knew I had destroyed it."<p>"Then I found myself being pulled into this statue. He had<br/>broken out and in anger had linked to me to hurt me the only way<br/>he knew how. Now I was charged with his emotion and being pulled<br/>back into the shielding, to protect him. No matter how hard I<br/>fought, it was futile."<p>"Is that why it's a 'She' now?" asked Akane.<p>Ranko nodded. "A side effect. Being both his curse and the<br/>keeper of his locked away emotions affected how he acted."<p>"Every time he changed into a girl, accident or otherwise, the<br/>stone weakened and bits of sensitivity leaked out. I know you<br/>noticed it. He didn't, but her personality was a bit more<br/>rounded."<p>Akane nodded. "I noticed. So, how did you get out?"<p>"Ahhh, I was wondering when you would ask."<p>"Well, all this time I was still locked away. I was forced to<br/>watch events unfold in his life, hoping someone or something<br/>would happen to free me from his suffering prison. But now I was<br/>a part of him and no longer wanting to hurt him. I was truly<br/>caring for him, which I shouldn't have."<p>He started having attacks because of his emotions were more<br/>exposed and he couldn't hide or defend them. His curse was<br/>making things worse. More emotions made people abuse him more,<br/>which made him draw back in."<p>"I'm sorry Ranko."<p>"...Then Nodoka showed up. For the first time in years, Ranma<br/>had a new emotion. Hope. Hope that she would love him, and she<br/>did as a girl, she just didn't know how much it hurt to hide from<br/>her like that."<p>That day, after Genma and Soon both drowned in the canal, Nodoka<br/>came back, and she recognized him. Despite being a girl she<br/>wanted him. She scraped together that dream I had destroyed,<br/>threw a female version of Ranma into it and make it a near<br/>reality. His happy place was happening. It went nuts down<br/>here."<p>"What happened?" Asked Akane. She made a sweeping gesture<br/>across the barren dunes. "Why does it still look like this<br/>then?"<p>Ranko giggled again. "Still? It was NEVER this bright until<br/>Nodoka came along. When she said she loved him, this place went<br/>nuclear."<p>"This statue shattered with a force so violent that I think I<br/>ceased to exist for a few seconds as my body recollected itself.<br/>I was free, and my own entity again, but I had changed."<p>"Years of pain washed over him and you remember how long it took<br/>for him to calm down. Everything he had endured, all for that<br/>moment, and he couldn't hold it back anymore."<p>His dream had come true, and for about ten minutes after he<br/>calmed down, this place seemed bright and nearly beautiful.<p>I watched as the walls of fog he had spent a lifetime building to<br/>protect himself were vaporized into the dunes of dust you see<br/>around us. His entire concept of life changed, in a single<br/>instant. He had someone who still loved him, who wasn't going to<br/>hurt him. No more running, no hunger and everything he went<br/>through to get his mother back, was over."<p>At the mention of it, Akane hung her head. "I know, I could have<br/>been there for him."<p>"Yes you could have, Akane, but you didn't. He never let you<br/>know how much he hurt and how much you could have helped. He<br/>really didn't know himself. His mother saw pain through his<br/>eyes, and she let him let it out."<p>"Then why is it a stone statue again?" Asked Akane. "You said<br/>it exploded and..."<p>Ranko interrupted her. "His mother has no idea what her actions,<br/>have done to him. You actions too for that matter."<p>"What do you mean by that?" Akane asked, her hand now on her<br/>hips.<p>Ranko sighed. "His mother missed 'Ranko Tendo', we heard her say<br/>it. She likes Ranma as a girl. She wasn't as pleased with<br/>Ranma-Kun as he thought she would be, at least by the expression<br/>on her face the first time she witnessed the change.<p>And your treatment of Ranma until yesterday was still horrible at<br/>best. Thanks to all the mixed emotions, Ranma is struggling to<br/>find who he is, and so he started protecting himself again. He<br/>only wants to make you both happy, but its hurting him. He<br/>doesn't know who he is anymore. You want the boy side, and his<br/>mother loves the girl side. He can't be both all the time."<p>As she said this, Akane wiped her eyes, and seemed to steel her<br/>resolve. She got on her knees and embraced the statue. Ranko<br/>watched as she gently wrapped her arms around it's chest.<p>"I'm sorry Ranma. I'm sorry for everything. I.. I don't know<br/>what to say to make everything better but I wish I did. I'm<br/>sorry I took out my own insecurity on you."<p>"You're not the only one with a crisis. Do you know what<br/>happened the first time I saw you? I fell in love with you. I<br/>saw you and I fell in love with you. Then dad discovered your<br/>assets and I freaked."<p>"All the boys at school that wanted me but I couldn't feel a<br/>thing for them, then you show up. Red hair, perfect little face,<br/>and suddenly this new fiancée is a girl."<p>"Finding that out hit me like a brick. I'm not supposed to swing<br/>that way, to be interested in other girls. So I tried to be<br/>friends, hoping that you would do something that I could use to<br/>justify hating you, but you didn't do anything until I saw you in<br/>the bath."<p>"Ranma, I love you. Forget everything I've ever said to you that<br/>hurt, because I was lying to myself. I was too angry to care<br/>about you and your feelings as a person. I'm sorry."<p>As she watched, the statue began cracking and then shattered. A<br/>myriad of whispering spirits and phantoms emerged. They were all<br/>brightly colored, and they swirled and collected back together<br/>and formed into a young redheaded girl.<p>She looked about seven or eight years old. She ran forward and<br/>hugged Akane. Akane hugged her back. The little girl suddenly<br/>broke out into tears, bawling and wailing intensely. Akane was<br/>joined as Ranko put her arms around them both.<p>Akane whispered into the girl's hair. "Let it all out Ranma.<br/>Give up the pain. I'll hold you as long as you need."</p>
