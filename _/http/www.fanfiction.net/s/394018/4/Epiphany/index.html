</div><p>Epiphany Chapter 4<p>By Tripolar Disorder<br/>and Dragon Dagger.<p>Revision 4.4.2<p>This is an alternative universe from the Ranma timeline.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-chan was sitting next to the mat. She was smiling and<br/>Nodoka was hugging her from behind, her eyes closed. She kissed<br/>the top of her daughter's head. "I'm glad you are ok dear. We<br/>were worried."<p>Cologne came returned from her faceplant and she and Shampoo were<br/>currently trying to determine if they just been dreaming.<p>Ranma-chan smiled widely as she looked at the strange face<br/>Shampoo was giving her. "I'm free of your amazon tricks. The<br/>Cat's tongue or anything else won't hurt me no more."<p>Shampoo tried to act innocent, her face difficult to read.<p>Nodoka looked at Cologne. "Care to explain?"<p>Cologne shrugged. "Never has my tribe seen anyone gain control of<br/>a curse. It would appear that you are no longer cursed at all<br/>Ranma. You now are a magic shapeshifter. I am curious as to how<br/>Ranma knew after waking up."<p>Ranma nodded. "A little voice in my head told me."<p>She looked over the girl, noticing how strange she seemed to be<br/>acting. Calm, reserved. Ranma-chan seemed buried in her<br/>mother's arms, her usual proud and arrogent demeiner replaced by<br/>child-like affection.<p>Cologne sent out her chi again, feeling the pathways. She<br/>realized that she was witnessing an emotion she had rarely seen<br/>in all her dealing with Ranma. Ranma wasn't mad, or upset, or<br/>anything usual. She was relaxed and seemed happy. All the<br/>problems she had seen with Ranma's thought patterns only minutes<br/>before, gone.<p>(Could his mother actually invoke this much change in<br/>personality?) Until yesterday she thought he didn't even have a<br/>mother. She decided she would look into it later. For now she<br/>would leave Ranma alone. If his mother really did have such an<br/>effect, then more time spent together could pacify Ranma, and<br/>make figuring out the source of his strange cure much easier.<p>Shampoo was sitting in the corner. She was both happy and jealous<br/>of Ranma, as she watched the girl shift form repeatedly as if his<br/>own body was a toy.<p>Nodoka cleared her throat. Ranma changed into girl form and<br/>twisted her body around to face her mother. Cologne and Shampoo<br/>did as well.<p>"If you will excuse us Matriarch, Ranma and I have some business<br/>to take care of, Unless you need anything else from us?"<p>"Momma, please forgive me for deceiving you when I asked if you<br/>still loved me. I really wanted to know. thank you for telling<br/>me the truth."<p>Nodoka pulled her back into her arms and held her again silently<br/>for a moment before responding. "You will always be my child, no<br/>matter what."<p>Cologne tried to smile as she showed them out. She had made a<br/>promise breaking the kisses, as well as protecting her from the<br/>tribe. She was not as upset as she thought in finding out Ranma<br/>was still able to be a man.<p>"Ranma, a word of advice." Commented Cologne. "You are not the<br/>only one once afflicted with a Jusenkyo curse. If I am to uphold<br/>my promise to protect you, I must ask you to refrain from<br/>changing in public without the use of water. In fact, I would<br/>reccomend that you change when struck by water anyway. Your cure<br/>is beyond my understanding, so far from duplicatable."<p>Ranma-chan nodded. "That's a good idea. Thank you. I don't<br/>want Ryoga or anyone else trying to beat a cure outta me if I<br/>ain't got one."<p>Cologne showed them out, watched them disappear down the road,<br/>then turned to Shampoo.<p>"Today has opened my eyes to a few things great-granddaughter. I<br/>may be more willing to believe some of the things that you have<br/>been trying to tell me."<p>Shampoo nodded. Then, I have but one thing to pass on you.<br/>Ranma made a comment earlier, and I want you to know exactly what<br/>she meant.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka gestured for Ranma to follow her. She had turned at a<br/>corner while Ranma had continued straight.<p>"Where we going mom?" asked Ranma-chan. "The Tendo Dojo is this<br/>way."<p>Nodoka replied. "We are going to our home Ranma. I need to pick<br/>up a couple things."<p>Ranma-chan quickly made her way back to Nodoka's side and they<br/>continued on down the street.<p>As they were walking Nodoka had time to think. She had fallen<br/>behind Ranma and was watching her child.<p>Nodoka began to notice a change in Ranma's stride. The girl began<br/>to slow down coming to a stop a few feet ahead. She just seemed<br/>to be staring off into space.<p>Nodoka came up behind and asked her what was wrong. She was<br/>surprised at the answer.<p>"Nothing really mom. Just looking around. I think I remember a<br/>little about this place." And look Ranma-chan did. It was<br/>interesting to just let the memories from her very young life<br/>float to the surface as she looked around.<p>There was a playground nearby and as Ranma-chan spotted it she<br/>remembered a painful memory. "I wasn't very strong when I was<br/>little was I?" She murmured to herself as she let the memory of<br/>getting beaten up by a bully on the playground play through her<br/>mind.<p>"No you weren't dear. But you have grown up so well. I think<br/>Those bullies would have their hands full."<p>"I wonder what they would think if a girl beat the snot out of<br/>them?" Ranma-chan smirked as a slightly devilish light came to<br/>her eyes.<p>Nodoka saw the grin and started chuckling. "Lets hope they don't<br/>get the courage to try something. I would hate for someone to<br/>get hurt."<p>Ranma-chan shrugged and smiling again letting the warm sun and<br/>the peaceful street scenes bring her mood back up. They walked<br/>along together, Ranma stopping several times to hug Nodoka before<br/>running ahead and exploring.<p>(Like a puppy on a leash, always checking to make sure she<br/>approved, before scampering off a little ways to check something<br/>out.) Nodoka thought to herself with a smile.<p>As they approached the house, Ranma-chan seemed to get a bit more<br/>excited. She apparently had remembered her first home.<p>Three young women across the street from them recognized Nodoka,<br/>waved to her and made their way across to meet her. Ranma<br/>instantly lost her good mood, and actually fell behind Nodoka in<br/>stride. She seemed to be trying to hide herself in her mother's<br/>shadow.<p>The women however were not fooled and one circled around while<br/>the other two stopped in front of Nodoka.<p>"Greetings Saotome-san. We are a bit early but we wanted to get<br/>on the road before noon."<p>Nodoka gasped softly. "Oh my, I comepletely forgot. It's been<br/>a busy week. Girls, I have some good news. This is Ranko, my<br/>daughter. I finally have my children back."<p>Onna-Ranma, currently being called Ranko, suddenly cried out and<br/>jumped several feet foward, landing in a defensive stance. She<br/>was suddenly breathing heavily as well.<p>"What's wrong?" Asked Nodoka quickly.<p>Ranko was staring back at the woman, who only a moment before had<br/>tried to sweep the redhead into a hug. Said adult was now<br/>staring back, her arms frozen in the position they were in when<br/>Ranko shot out of reach.<p>"Momma... she, uhm, I..." And that was the last that came out<br/>as Ranko realized what was actually happening and how badly she<br/>had misunderstood the situation. She dropped to her knees and<br/>curled up, hiding her face, her arms tightly pulling her knees in<br/>to defend her face.<p>Nodoka was just as quickly by her side, pulling her daughter onto<br/>her lap. The women all stood motionless, waiting.<p>Ranko's face was now visable again but her eyes now lacked focus.<br/>She looked to have lapsed into a trance.<p>"Saotome-san. What is wrong with Ranko?"<p>Nodoka continued to hold Ranko, rocking her child back and forth.<p>"I'm sorry Atsuko, but my late husband took my children away from<br/>me when they were young. I am certain that their childoods were<br/>full of pain. Ranko was so abused, that she thought you were<br/>trying to attack her, and her reflexes kicked in."<p>"All the things that that idiot did to them, I can't think of<br/>how emotionally scarred they are."<p>Ranko started to come back, her eyes blinked slowly, and she<br/>turned her head, looking around at her situation.<p>Atsuko spoke softly. "Ranko, I'm sorry I starled you like that.<br/>Please forgive me."<p>Ranko nodded, and managed to stutter out. "I'm sorry I jumped.<br/>Pops always attacked me from behind and I.."<p>The second girl, Sayoko interrupted. "Did he ever touch you?"<p>Ranko nodded a little. "Yeah, he used to hit me whenever he saw<br/>an opening in my defenses."<p>Sayoko shook her head. "No Ranko, I mean did he ever... Molest<br/>you?"<p>Ranko's face scewed. "No way? Pops never did any of that. He<br/>may have been a drunk and a terrible excuse for a father, but he<br/>never, NEVER did that. He hated child rapists, and I personally<br/>watched him beat the snot outta this guy who admitted he fondled<br/>little girls."<p>Sayoko took a few steps forward, placing her hands on Ranko's<br/>shoulders. "You don't have to lie about it. If he molested you,<br/>it wasn't your fault."<p>Ranko twitched and fell backward onto the pavement. "WHA! No<br/>way! I told you, Pops NEVER tried anything like that. He beat<br/>on me, yeah, and threw me in a pit of hungry cats and tons other<br/>stuff, but he was always trying to teach me th' art."<p>Ranko flipped herself onto her feet. then walked up and squared<br/>herself face to face with Sayoko.<p>"What do I have to do to prove that I'm tellin the truth?"<p>Sayoko slowly opened her arms and Ranko stepped forward. A<br/>moment later and both were smiling as Sayoko had her arms wrapped<br/>around the smaller girl. Two more pairs of arms followed suit,<br/>and Ranko finally seemed to calm down.<p>"Alright Ranko-chan, I believe you. So you coming along to the<br/>beach with us then?"<p>Ranko turned toward Atsuko, "The beach?"<p>Atsuko added in. "Oh, I know. We'll all tell the driver that<br/>Ranko is your assistant and she can come with."<p>Ranma looked back and forth between her mother and the other<br/>girls. "What are you talking about? Where are you going?"<p>Nodoka smiled. "That is a great idea. Ranko dear, will you<br/>follow me inside and help me carry my equipment?"<p>Ranma's nervousness disappeared instantly. "Yes momma." and she<br/>followed Nodoka as she made her way into the house.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Momma, what's going on, and who are those girls?" asked Ranko<br/>questionly as Nodoka started to flip through a small book of<br/>phone numbers.<p>"Well dear, when your father left with you, I realized that I<br/>didn't have a way to support myself. I turned a hobby interest<br/>in photography into a little business that pays the bills."<p>"They are here because I scheduled a photo shoot on the beach<br/>today and I forgot about it."<p>"Well, I'll go back to the tendos then, so you can work."<p>"Nonsense dear. You're coming with. Atsuko explained how.<br/>You're going to be my assistant. I hope you can help me<br/>carry..."<p>Nodoka was stunned as Ranko lifted the large case one-handed, as<br/>if it were empty, and she knew for a fact that over seventy<br/>kilograms of equipment was inside.<p>"Wow momma. this thing is heavier than it looks. I guess I'm<br/>coming along then, by the look on your face."<p>"Let me call the Tendos." Replied Nodoka, smiling.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nodoka was unpacking her camera supplies while the models went to<br/>change clothes. Ranko had been asked if she owned a bathing suit<br/>while they were on the trip and it was decided that they needed<br/>to go buy her one.<p>Ranko had resisted at first before Nodoka calmed her down and<br/>whispered something in her ear. Ranko had reluctantly agreed and<br/>shuffled off after the girls.<p>Nodoka had gotten the last camera loaded and primed when she was<br/>brought out of her musing by someone in front of her clearing her<br/>throat.<p>She looked up to see the models in their swimwear. It was<br/>obvious that Ranko was standing behind them, and she too was<br/>bare-legged.<p>Atsuko and Sayoko parted and Ranko stepped forward. She was clad<br/>in a shimering royal blue tank suit. She moved with small steps,<br/>shyly, waiting for Nodoka's reaction.<p>"You look beautiful Ranko. I think maybe I'll have to include<br/>you in some of my photos today, if that's alright with you."<p>The girls behind her giggled. "Of course Saotome-San. With all<br/>the work we went through to get her into something girlish, she<br/>better sit still for you."<p>Ranko blushed softly. "I think I can handle a couple pictures<br/>being taken of me. Nabiki is gunna be pissed off when she finds<br/>out that you got me looking like this."<p>Nodoka stood up and stepped around her equipment. She pulled<br/>Ranko into a quick hug. "Well of course I want to get pictures<br/>of you. I've got so many moments of your life that I missed,<br/>but I don't plan to miss any more."<p>She handed Ranko a camera. "Now assistant. Since you were<br/>obviously busy preparing the models, I loaded the cameras. Your<br/>job is to give me a fresh one when I run out of film. Think you<br/>can handle that?"<p>Ranko nodded. "Of course oh great Saotome-san. You can count on<br/>me!"<p>Everyone got a quick laugh, then Nodoka started them on the day's<br/>activities.</p>
