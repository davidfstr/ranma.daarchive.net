</div><p>Oneesama, oneesan = older sister<br/>Oniichan, 'niichan = older brother<br/>Baka = idiot, stupid, etc.</p>= = = = = = = = =<p>Manager Ranma 1/2<p>Episode 3<p>Let the Battle Begin!<br/>Ranma Vs. Motoko: Round 1<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[ The smell of cooked  food filled the air of the kitchen as Ranma made breakfast. Hotaru  walked in and greeted Ranma. Amazingly, more than just Hotaru showed up  for the meal this morning. Misato, who immediately blushed at the sight  of Ranma, and Urd also showed up. Ranma did likewise as he caught  Misato's form enterring. Urd, feeling the uneasiness between the two,  raised an eyebrow and looked back and forth the two. ]<p>Urd: Did something...happen between you two?<p>Ranma: ...<p>Misato: ...<p>Urd: Okay, now I KNOW something happened! What is it?<p>[ The two still said  nothing. Ranma coughed uncomfortably into his hand. ]<p>Urd: Geez, you guys are acting like you both got drunk and had wild sex all night.<p>[ Urd was further  astonished that Ranma's and Misato's faces became even redder than they  already were. The goddess's eyes widened, as did Hotaru's. ]<p>Urd: NO WAY! (thinks) There's no way Misa-chan could of gotten him before me!<p>Hotaru: R-Ranma-san...? Misato-san? (thinks) Ranma-san isn't that type of man...is he?<p>[ To the relief of  their audience, both of the accused shook their heads furiously. ]<p>Ranma: N-No! It's not that. Uh... (looks at Misato)<p>[ Ranma was hesitant in  answering because he knew it would embarrass his boss. ]<p>Misato: W-We didn't have sex...I accidentally walked in on Ranma while he was bathing in the hot springs.<p>[ Naturally, Urd began cracking up like there was no tomorrow. ]<p>Urd: Are you serious? Ahaha, that's great! Are you <i>suuure</i> it was an accident Misa? (winks at Misato)<p>Misato: O-Of course it was! I'm not a pervert! I was just a bit tired  from working so late last night that I didn't notice he was in there!  And I'd had a few drinks before that.<p>Urd: Haha, this is great!  This is even better than Ranma walking in on Setsu-chan while she was  in the hot springs yesterday!<p>Misato: WHAT? (angrily turns to Ranma, thinks) He better not turn out to be another Kaji!<p>Ranma: (thinks) Oh man...thank god Motoko and Setsuna aren't here...<p>Hotaru: (aghast) R-Ranma-san?<p>Ranma: (waves hands defensively) Er, it's not what you think! Really! Arrrggghhh!<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>Motoko: KYAAAA!<p>[ Motoko swung her  bokken in a swift, horizontal motion and cut through the air. Sweat  covered her body and soaked her clothes. She wiped the perspiration  from her brow while taking a moment to catch her breath. Touching her  stomach thoughtfully, she began making her way to the kitchen. ]<p>Motoko: That should be enough for now. I am starving. I wonder who's turn it is to cook, it smells good.<p>[ In the kitchen, Ranma  sighed as he began cleaning up the left overs. He was right. It had  been Hell explaining his way out of that situation and that wasn't even  the worst of it. He knew Motoko and Setsuna would eventually find out.  Shuddering, the young manager did not look forward to that. Right then,  Motoko walked in. Surprised at first, she glared at Ranma. In response,  he cast her an annoyed expression. ]<p>Ranma: ... (thinks) It's too damn early in the morning for this!<p>Motoko: ... (thinks) I am hungry but I refuse to eat this man's cooking!<p>[ At that second,  Motoko's stomach let out a loud, beastly roar, causing her face to  flush red. She stood there in the doorway, unable to decide whether to  step into the kitchen for food or not. Ranma, despite himself, had to  grin a bit. The stomach never lies. ]<p>Ranma: Are you gonna come in or not? There's some left overs if ya want it. It's still warm.<p>Motoko: ...I'm fine. I only came in here for...for a glass of water.<p>Ranma: (shrugs) Suit yourself. You're acting like I poisoned it or something.<p>Motoko: Perhaps you did. The evil of men knows no bounds. We are still to fight at noon after all.<p>Ranma: (rolls eyes) The evil of men...? You gotta be kidding me. Just  'cuz your sis got hitched don't mean you gotta take it out on me!<p>Motoko: What? Who told you that? And that's none of your business!<p>Ranma: (shakes head to self) Whatever. (thinks) Geez, why are girls always so stubborn?<p>[ As Motoko got a glass  of water, Ranma took it upon himself to gather up what was left of  breakfast and made a plate for Motoko. He placed it on the table and  left without a word. Motoko was surprised when she turned around and  saw the plate of food. Suspiciously, she looked around the corner for  Ranma, but found he was not there. It wasn't longer before Motoko  succumbed to the whims of her stomach and began eating Ranma's cooking.  ]<p>Motoko: Hmph. Foolish man...<p>[ Motoko took her first  bite of the food. She chewed it slowly and carefully, before blinking,  eyes wide. ]<p>Motoko: This is...rather good.<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[ Ranma walked through  hallways, making his rounds of the building to check if anything was  broken or needed fixing. During a pass of Skuld's room, he noticed her  door was open. That in itself wasn't odd except for the fact that, from  what he could see, it was pitch black inside. Considering the time of  day it was, Ranma did find that a bit odd. Curiosity got the best  of him and the manager decided to check out what was up. Besides, he  hadn't talked much to Skuld before and he figured this would be a good  time to get acquainted. He knocked on the half-open door lightly. ]<p>Ranma: Skuld...? You here?<p>[ Ranma pushed the door completely open, stepped inside and... ]<p>Ranma: (eyes bulging) Wha...what the heck?<p>[ The martial artist  was greeting by the sight of a gigantic laboratory. Although the room  was dark, it had the feel of outer space because of the scattered balls  of light that covered the area. The lights were coming from dozens and  dozens of odd looking machines and mechanisms. ]<p>Ranma: What is this?<p>Unknown: INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT!<p>[ Ranma, at the last  second, barely managed dodge a curved blade that was now embedded into  the ground where he had been. An oddly, simple looking humanoid, albeit  blocky, robot was the attacker. Its eyes glowed yellow at Ranma who was  in a fighting stance. ]<p>Ranma: Wait a sec here, I was just- ARGH!<p>[ Cutting off Ranma,  the robot lunged at him and executed several strikes with its arms.  Ranma blocked the attacks but winced in pain. ]<p>Ranma: Man,  this thing sure can hit hard! (glares at robot) Alright buddy, I didn't  wanna break Skuld's toy, but I ain't got no choice now! <i>Kachuu Tenshin Amaguriken</i>!<p>[ Ranma dashed forward,  ducking under another strike from the robot, and unleashed his famous  technique into the robot's breastplate. Surprising, the dents from his  fists weren't as deep as Ranma expected. He flipped backwards to  safety with a look of wonder on his face. ]<p>Ranma: What's this thing made of?<p>[ The robot responded  by holding its claw-shaped hands in front itself. Sparkling blue  electricity began crackling in its palms as it walked forward slowly. ]<p>Ranma: Oh yeah? Hmph! <i><b>Haaaaaaaa</b></i>...<p>[ Spreading his legs  outwards, elbows at his sides with his fists pointing at the robot,  Ranma summoned his golden battle aura. The pigtailed man grinned at his  opponent. ]<p>Ranma: Guess I'll use you to warm up for my fight with Motoko! Get ready Tin Can!<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[ Skuld was walking back to her room. She saw her door fully open. ]<p>Skuld: Oh, whoops, guess I forgot to close it.<p>[ As she neared closer  to her room, the sounds of electricity, battle cries, and fist meeting  metal alarmed Skuld. Flashes of light were lighting up Skuld's dark  room. ]<p>Skuld: What's going on? Banpei?<p>[ Skuld quickly ran  inside her room to see Ranma, his battle aura flaring wildly, flying  toward her robot in a jump kick. ]<p>Ranma: Eat this! Saotome Shooting Star Kick!<p>[ With that, Ranma  finally managed to defeat the robot by knocking off its head in a  ki-induced attack. Breathing heavily, Ranma hunched forward with his  hands on his thighs. A salty sweat dripped from his forehead. ]<p>Ranma: Man...I've gotta be getting rusty if a damn robot gave me a tough time!<p>[ Skuld switched on the  lights to get a better view of the scene. When she switched on the  lights, all the machines disappeared and only a normal looking, sun lit  room remained. ]<p>Ranma: What the?<p>Skuld: (shocked) B-Banpei-kun?<p>[ Skuld, teary-eyed,  rushed over and picked up the robots head. She stared at it sadly for a  moment before turning to glare angrily at Ranma. Ranma formed a large  sweatdrop by the side of his head. ]<p>Skuld: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY BANPEI-KUN!<p>Ranma: Er, I didn't mean to-<p>Skuld: Didn't mean to? DIDN'T MEAN TO?<p>[ Skuld, despite her  height, actually appeared to be towering over Ranma menacingly, who  cowered away slightly. ]<p>Skuld: Do you have any idea how long it took me upgrade Banpei-kun to X.017? Do you?<p>Ranma: No-<p>Skuld: A long time, that's how long!<p>Ranma: Hey, I'm sorry okay!<p>Skuld: (beginning to get teary-eyed again) Sorry doesn't cut it! My robots are all I have and...and...(sniff)...<p>[ Ranma immediately  cringed as she began sniffling. He hesitantly his arm on her shoulder  and knelt down next to her. ]<p>Ranma: Um, I'm really sorry...c'mon, don't cry! I'll make it up to you!<p>Skuld: (sniffs sadly) How can you? Banpei X.017 was the only version I  got to work properly! All the other versions always had malfunctions...  (sniffs again) If only I was a better mechanic...or if I could use  magic...then maybe I could be with Oneesama and not in this stupid  place!<p>[ Ranma,  of course, didn't really know what to do or say. He tried patting her  on the back consolingly. ]<p>Ranma: Don't worry about it, I'll help ya make an even better robot!<p>[ As if just realized  Ranma was still there, Skuld hopped back and resumed her glare at  Ranma. She rubbed away her tears angrily on her sleeve and pointed at  him. ]<p>Skuld: This is all your fault!<p>[ She took out a large  polearm hammer out of no where and smashed Ranma on the head with all  her might before he could do anything. Ranma muttered out one last  sentence before darkness took him. ]<p>Ranma: D-Damn...tomboys...<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[ Ranma gradually began  to wake up. He was lying on his back in Skuld's futon. He sat up  slowly. ]<p>Ranma: (groggily) Ugh...where am I? What hit me?<p>Skuld: You're in my room. And I hit you.<p>[ The scene from a few  moments ago came to him, replaying in his head, as he turned to look at  Skuld. He remembered the hammer. ]<p>Ranma: (thinks, astonished) What the hell? How did she knock me out in one hit?<p>[ Over the years of  abuse in Nerima, Ranma had gained an uncanny endurance. Unlike when he  first showed up at the Tendo home, where a simple table to the head  would knock him out, the young man could now easily withstand  quite a lot from females without losing consciousness. Sure, he'd be  pummeled into LEO often, but he would still be awake. ]<p>Ranma: (thinks) Geez, what's that thing made of? I guess maybe she really is a goddess.<p>[ Ranma shook his head  to himself and turned his attention to the girl before him. Unlike most  of the females he knew, she looked neither angry nor overtly worried  about him. Her expression was unreadable. ]<p>Ranma: Hey! Watcha hit me for?</p><p>Skuld: Because you crushed Banpei-kun jerk!</p><p>Ranma: It attacked me first!</p><p>Skuld: He was-</p><p>[ Skuld looked like she was about to blurt something out, but the  little goddess stopped herself, sighing. ]<p>Skuld: ...nevermind. I shouldn't of hit you so hard I guess. I overreacted. After all, you are the manager of this place now.<p>[  Ranma blinked in surprise at the girl's statement. Unable to contain  himself, he started chuckling which made Skuld glare at him. ]<p>Skuld: (annoyed) What's so funny!<p>Ranma:  (holds up hands defensively) Oh, it's nothing really, I'm not laughing  at you. It's just that you kinda remind me of someone I used to know.  The funny thing is, even though you're younger than her, you're a lot  more mature than she ever was that's for sure. (pauses) Um...I really  am sorry about breaking your robot thingy.<p>Skuld: Oh, I see...it's okay. It's just...I've, um, been through a lot lately...<p>[  Ranma glanced at Skuld. He could see that she wanted to say more, but  didn't want to open herself up to someone she just met. Deciding to  help her out a bit, Ranma took up an easygoing tone and started  talking. ]<p>Ranma: I think I know what ya mean. You're really close to you're 'neesan ain't ya?<p>Skuld: (nodding) She means a lot to me...<p>[ Ranma waited for her to say more, but she didn't. ]<p>Ranma: ...I kinda envy you ya know. I don't really have a family anymore.<p>[ Curiosity got the better of Skuld. ]<p>Skuld: Are they...dead?<p>Ranma:  Oh, no, nothing like that. But...I dunno, sometimes I think it would of  been better if I never knew them at all. My...my pops took me away from  my mom when I was only five years old. I didn't see her again for ten  whole years because we were on a training trip. Heck, until a couple  years ago, I didn't even know she was alive!<p>Skuld: You're dad never talked about her?<p>Ranma: Nope. He was actually SCARED of her!<p>[  Ranma went on to tell Skuld of his father's harsh training methods and  the "man among men" pledge. Skuld listened aptly. ]<p>Skuld:  That's horrible! You're mom would never of went through with the  pledge...would she? (thinks) Mortals are such barbarians!<p>Ranma:  (shakes head) The scary thing is...I don't know. She accepted me as a  man, but if she didn't...I honestly don't know if she would of did it  or not. She's a real traditional woman. I'll never understand why she  took the pledge so seriously or why she let Pops take me away. She  didn't even seem that mad when she'd heard all the crap Pops put me  through. (sighs) It doesn't really matter now though. They aren't  really my parents anymore anyways.<p>Skuld: What do you mean? You're still a Saotome aren't you?<p>Ranma:  For one reason or another, yeah...I'm still a Saotome. I'm the head of  the clan now. You don't really wanna hear the details.<p>[  Ranma had felt a great weight being lifted off his shoulders. He had no  idea why, but he felt it incredibly easy to open up to the little girl.  Maybe it was because she was just a kid, or maybe it was because of the  odd aura she emitted, he didn't know. Ranma smiled at Skuld. ]<p>Ranma: Thanks for listening to me. I'm sure I bored ya to death with all that.<p>Skuld:  It's okay. (hesitantly) ...My oneesama is like a mother to me. I never  really knew my mom and my "dad" isn't exactly your typical father.  That's why I've always been close to my sister, Belldandy. I used to  live with her until recently. I'm actually here as punishment.<p>Ranma: (raised an eyebrow) Punishment?<p>Skuld: (nods slowly) Well, it all started when...<p>[  Skuld gave Ranma a long summary of all the events that went on with her  sister and her boyfriend. From demons, to love spells gone wrong, the  little goddess told the mortal everything. It was the first time she'd  opened up to anyone besides her sister Belldandy. Ranma listened with  his eyes wide. He was amazed to know that he wasn't the only one with a  wacked out life. Although he didn't seem to completely grasp the fact  that she truly was a "goddess", he accepted that she was some type of  magical being. By studying her aura closely, he could see that the aura  she displayed was actually some type of mask. Skuld began to wrap up  her story. ]<p>Skuld: (taking in a deep breath) ...and that's how  I ended up here. (blinks, as if surprised by herself) Wow, I've never  actually told anyone all that before.<p>Ranma: Whoa, you weren't  kidding when you said you've been through a lot! How come you haven't  talked to anyone about this before? (grimly) I know from experience  that it ain't good to keep it all to yourself because it'll just keep  building up until one day you just <b>POP</b>. Didn't you say Urd is your older half sister? How come you don't talk to her?<p>[ A dry expression crossed Skuld's face. ]<p>Skuld: You've met Urd. She's not exactly the sympathizing type...<p>[  Ranma had a flashback of all the brief meetings he'd had with Urd  and grimaced. ]<p>Ranma: Er, I guess you're right.<p>Skuld: By the way, how <i>did</i> you beat Banpei-kun?<p>Ranma: (shrugs) Not as if I could lose to some robot toy.<p>Skuld:  (angrily) Banpei-kun is NOT just some toy! He was designed to fight  demons! (wryly) And don't act like it was a piece of cake.<p>[  To emphasize her point, she poked Ranma in the side causing him to  wince in pain. ]<p>Ranma: Ouch! Okay, okay, I'll admit the little tin bugger did put up a good fight.<p>[  Although she was still miffed at Ranma, a small smile began forming,  tugging at tips of Skuld's lips. ]<p>Skuld: Hmph, this "tin bugger" will do a lot more than put up a good fight next time you muscle head!<p>Ranma:  (grins) Ha! We'll see about that! (realization struck his face) Oh  crap, I gotta start cooking lunch early! I'll see ya around Skuld-chan!<p>Skuld: Okay, bye Ranma.<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[  Since it was Saturday, all the residents of Hinata Inn were currently  eating at the table except for Mihoshi and Motoko. Mihoshi was still  out on a business trip of some sort (that's what she told Ranma) and  Motoko had eaten out early. She was outside preparing. Hotaru watched  Ranma eat with a worried expression. Skuld and Misato had doubtful  looks on their faces. On the other hand, Setsuna looked neutral on the  matter while Urd appeared amused as usual. Ranma was eating his meal as  if nothing was out of the ordinary. ]<p>Hotaru: Are you sure you'll be alright Ranma-san? Motoko-senpai is a very good martial artist.<p>Ranma: Naaah, I'll be fine.<p>Misato: I don't know Ranma...I can't just ignore Motoko's deal if she does win.<p>Ranma: (grins) Ha! There's no way I'm gonna lose to her, trust me.<p>Misato: (shakes head, mutters) Headstrung baka...<p>Ranma: Hey, I heard that!<p>Skuld: But aren't you tired from fighting Banpei-kun?<p>Ranma: Ah don't worry about it, I've been through a lot worse. Trust me.<p>Urd: (curiously) Ranma fought Banpei?<p>Ranma: Yup. And won, naturally.<p>Misato: (dryly) Naturally...<p>Skuld: Hmph, that's only because I haven't installed the MXGP-03 Plasma Cannons yet! You'll see next time!<p>Urd: (surprised) Wait, you beat Banpei? Wow, not bad!<p>[  Ranma shrugged. During all this, Setsuna remained silent and kept to  herself. Admittedly, she did want to see how Ranma faired against  Motoko. They finished eating soon and went outside to where Motoko was  waiting with a determined glare on her face. Motoko got into a fighting  stance and Ranma followed suit shortly. ]<p>Ranma: Ready when you  are. (thinks) This'll be easy. I'll just dodge around for a while, tire  her out, then sweep her off her feet.<p>Motoko: Very well. I'm warning you though. Yesterday I was not myself. Today I am ready.<p>Ranma: Whatever you say.<p>[  Surprisingly, Motoko didn't get mad at all and remained calm. The grip  on her bokken tightened as she closed her eyes. Winds pushed the leaves  around while both combatants held their ground. Motoko opened her eyes  suddenly and rushed toward Ranma with a battle cry. Ranma was stunned  momentarily by the speed and power of the strike that grazed his chest,  cutting his silk shirt open. After maneuvering around two more powerful  slashes, Ranma back flipped to a safe distance with a slightly shocked  expression crossing his features. Motoko smirked. ]<p>Motoko: I warned you.<p>Ranma: I-I let you get that one!<p>Motoko: Let's hear you say that when you lose.<p>Ranma: (thinks) What the heck? She's like a completely different person from yesterday!<p>Motoko: (thinks) Good. For whatever reason, my body no longer heats up when I look at him.<p>[  Motoko charged in once again and stabbed forward at his abdomen.  Although the blow missed, she quickly followed up, bringing her blade  upward to Ranma's face. Ranma tilted his head back but wasn't able to  dodge it completely. The tip of the bokken nicked his chin and it was  enough to send Ranma sprawling into the ground. He recovered soon,  but Motoko pressed her advantage, not giving Ranma any time to breath.  The martial artist prodigy was forced to use his hands and arms to swat  away Motoko's weapon. After another minute of dodging and blocking,  Ranma was forced to admit that the battle with Banpei <i>did</i> tire him some. Ranma's brow furrowed. ]<p>Ranma: (thinks) Damn it...she's good!<p>Motoko: (slightly frustrated) Why aren't you fighting back!<p>Ranma: Uh, well...you're a girl.<p>Motoko: (raises eyebrow) Yes, and?<p>Ranma: I don't fight girls.<p>[ Everyone face-faulted. ]<p>Motoko: You fool! Do you think to belittle me even though you are losing this battle? Hmph, enough of this!<p>[  Motoko brought her arms above her head, bokken in hand, and  concentrated. Gradually, she summoned a blue aura that outlined her  figure. Though it wasn't as large as an aura Ranma would summon, it was  focused and controlled. With a cry, she sliced the bokken in a downward  motion. ]<p>Motoko: <i><b>ZANTETSUSEN</b></i>!<p>[  A wave of blue ki in the shape of a crescent moon came forth out of her  bokken and sped at Ranma with alarming speed. Stunned, Ranma was almost  caught in the wave as he jumped to the side. The wave connected with a  nearby wall and exploded. ]<p>Motoko: This no time to be laying on the ground! Again! <i>ZANTETSUSEN</i>...<b><i>HYAAA</i></b>!<p>[  Another wave came at Ranma. The pigtailed martial artist hurriedly  dodged left of it, but was surprised to see a second wave already  coming at him. Seeing he had no time to escape, he flung his body as  far he could to the side to avoid a direct hit. Ranma crossed his  arms in front of his chest and braced himself for impact. The  wave slammed into him, vaulting him into a wall behind and created a  small crater in it. Ranma was still standing, but smoke rose from  his bruised arms. ]<p>Ranma: (shocked, thinks) MAN! Those things  are as strong as a Shi Shi Hokodan and she whips 'em out like there's  no tomorrow! I can't keep dodging like this!<p>Motoko: Ha! I've got you now!<p>Ranma: Wha...?<p>[  Ranma looked around and quickly realized that he had no where to run  this time, being caught in between two large tree and a wall. ]<p>Motoko: <i>ZANTETSUSEN</i>!<p>Ranma: Ah shi-<p>[  He couldn't go backwards, nor to the sides, and the wave reached all  the way to the ground which ruled out ducking. It was also tall enough  that he couldn't jump over it...without help. Thinking fast, he  leaped onto the tree next to him and quickly bounced off  it onto the other tree opposite of him. In a zig zag motion, he  got high enough so that he could avoid the wave and flip onto the roof.  Ranma breathed a sigh of relief while Motoko growled. ]<p>Motoko: You won't get away!<p>[  Motoko followed Ranma's actions and found herself on the roof as well.  The residents of Hinata Inn rushed back inside towards the roof. Ranma  clenched his fist at Motoko. ]<p>Ranma: Alright, that's it! No  more  Guy! I was trying to go easy on ya since you're a girl,  but there's no way in hell I'm gonna lose!<p>Motoko: Tough talk coming from a coward! <i>ZANTETSUSEN</i>!<p>[  In flash, Ranma's aura flared violently to life. He held his hands in  front of him, palms facing towards each other, and created  a sphere of brilliant golden energy. ]<p>Ranma: <i>MOUKO TAKIBISHA</i>!<p>[  Thrusting forward, he shot off of gigantic ball, matching the wave in  height and defeating it in width. The two attacks met and, in a  dazzling light show, canceled each other out. Motoko's eyes were wide  with amazement, but that didn't stop her from following up with  another. Ranma expected this. He cupped his hands together once  again. ]<p>Ranma: <i><b>MOUKO TAKIBISHA...</b></i><b><i>HAAAAA</i></b>!<p>[  This time a more powerful ki projectile came forth from Ranma's palms.  This time, the yellow ki was transformed into a horizontal beam. The  beam met the wave and once more fought against Motoko's blue wave,  but the beam won out and drowned the wave in the yellow energy. Motoko  hastily brought bokken in front of her and blocked as much as she could  of the beam. Ranma grinned at Motoko who stared back angrily  in return. ]<p>Motoko: That was nothing-<b>cough-</b><b>cough-</b><p>[  Motoko halted mid-sentence as an unhealthy cough forced its way out of  her throat. Ranma raised an eyebrow, but said anything. Once the  coughing ceased, she continued to stare furiously at the male before  her. She would not lose to this man. He was nothing compared to one  such as herself. She could tell that was he tiring. His finely toned  muscles were swollen and bruised. Sweat glistened across his lightly  tanned skin which made his complexion seem as if it was sparkling.  The smug expression he wore was a facade. Motoko could tell from  his cute, rounded cheeks that he was gritting his teeth.  Those handsome eyes of his were narrowed with- In a bursting shock of  reality, Motoko could suddenly feel her heartbeat speeding up. A red  blush appeared on Motoko's face in full as her body heated up, eyes  wide. ]<p>Motoko: (thinks) WHAT AM I THINKING? Why must my body betray me now of all times! Why-<p>Ranma: You're distracted!<p>[ Before she knew it, Ranma was upon her. ]<p>Ranma: <i><b>KACHUU TENSHIN AMAGURIKEN</b></i>!<p>[  Motoko barely had time to bring up her defenses and try to block the  impending hundreds of fists. ]<p>Motoko: (stunned) S-Such speed!<p>[  She could only block a quarter of them as the strikes pummeled into her  body. Although, he did pull some of his blows. She was still a girl  after all. After Ranma finished, Motoko fell to her knees and let out a  small cough. Ranma wasn't blind, even he could see that her face was as  red as a rose. ]<p>Ranma: Uh...you okay there Moto-<p>Motoko: (angrily) I'M FINE! I'm not done yet Saotome!</p><p>Ranma:  (thinks) This fight is over. She was good...she was really good come  to think of it. Good ki control, great form, she was no fake like Kuno.  Definitely better than Shampoo or Akane or any of them for that matter.  Wait, then how come...oh.</p><p>[ Woozily, she used her bokken as support and stood herself up while  letting out heavy breaths. Ranma dropped his stance and walked over to  Motoko. ]<p>Ranma: (scratching the back of his head) Sheesh, some martial artist you are-<p>Motoko: (scoffs disgustedly) J-just to be expected from a man, gloating over a weakened opponent.<p>Ranma:  (annoyed) I didn't mean it like that! Quit jumping to conclusions will  ya! I'm just saying that you'd think you'd know your own body well  enough to know that you're sick.<p>[ Motoko blinks. ]<p>Motoko: Wh-what?<p>Ranma: You're sick ya dumb bokken tomboy.<p>[  There was no smugness Ranma's tone, he was just stating it a  matter-of-factly. Still, Motoko glared at Ranma for the insults and  began to muster up all her strength for one final attack. ]<p>Motoko: How dare you!<p>[  She swung at Ranma's head as hard she could, but the blow was sloppy.  Ranma merely tilted his head to one side and the bokken pass by.  However, Motoko became a victim to momentum and sickness as she  overshot Ranma and fell towards...the air. She was at the edge of the  roof. Having no strength left in her, the kendoist began to fall  helplessly towards the ground. A single tear escaped Motoko's eyes. ]<p>Motoko:  (thinks sadly) I have failed...a man has finally defeated me. I  am...pathetic. Undoubtedly in due time I will become a weak, giggling  girl, give up the art, and become married to a savage male...<p>[  Motoko waited for the end to come...but it never came. A hand grabbed  her hand while an arm wrapped itself around her waist, pulling her into  a firm grasp against a familiar chiseled chest. She looked up into  a pair of blue pearls, astonished. ]<p>Ranma: You okay?<p>[  Motoko was surprised at the amount of concern his voice. Was she not  his enemy? Why was he being so caring? ]<p>Motoko: Y-Yes...(quietly) Thank you...<p>Ranma: Uh, no prob.<p>[  The stood there in silence, Motoko still Ranma's warm embrace. It took  them a moment to realize at the proximity of their closeness. Both  blushing furiously, they quickly separated. And just in time  too as the residents of Hinata Inn finally made it towards their  battleground. ]<p>Urd: Is it over? Who won?<p>Ranma: (scratching his forehead) Ah, well...no one did.<p>Everyone: Huh?<p>Ranma: She's sick. I think she has a fever or something so...yeah. Ain't very fair.<p>Motoko: (stunned, thinks) Why did he say that? He could of easily told them that he had won since technically he did.<p>[  Ranma casually began walking into the apartment complex. He halted in  the doorway and turned to Motoko with a grin. ]<p>Ranma: We'll fight again after ya get some rest. And next time I won't hold back.<p>[ It took the still stunned Motoko some time to come up with a reply. ]<p>Motoko: Hmph.</p><p>[ Despite her better judgement, she let a small smile creep up on her face. ]</p><p>Motoko: Very well then. I will look forward to our next battle...Ranma.<p>Ranma: Heh.<p>[ Everyone simply looked on at the scene in completely confusion. ]<p>Misato: Uh, did something just happen between them?<p>Urd: Beats me.<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>A/N:  This chapter, though a bit difficult to write (I'm definitely NOT the  best action writter by far), came surprisingly easy to me. It was also  a lot longer than I expected it to be. Anyways, I just realized I  know very little about Motoko's techniques besides their names. If  anyone knows of a good site or something that has pictures or  descriptions of Motoko's attacks, let me know! I would greatly  appreciate it!</p><p>Hmmm...I wonder who I should pair Ranma up with?  If ya think I'm favoring one girl over the other at this point, I'm  not. I'm just getting started. For the beginning chapters, every  girl will have their time to get to know Ranma and vice versa with  Ranma getting to know them.</p>
