</div>= = = = = = = = =<p>Manager Ranma 1/2<p>Episode 2<p>Perils of a Manager!<br/>The Accidental Pervert!<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>(It was a new, bright  and sunny morning. Ranma-chan, in her boxers and tank top, was sleeping  in Misato's rooming, along with three other people: Misato, Urd, and  Mihoshi. Ranma-chan's was laying on the floor with Misato stretched out  on Ranma-chan's stomach. Misato's hand was on top of Ranma-chan's  breast. Urd was below Misato, on top of Ranma-chan's thighs, with her  legs laying across Misato and Mihoshi was sleeping stretched out across  Urd's lap. Misato twitched in her sleep causing her to squeeze the  breast in her hand. The young martial artist groggily began waking up.)<p>Ranma-chan: (groans) Wh-wha... What... (looks around slowly, vision  focusing) Where... Where am I? (eyes widen as she sees everyone  sprawled out on the floor) Crap. (thinks) Oh god, did I...do it?  No...can't be, I still have my clothes on and I'm a girl...uh, why am I  in my girl form and why is Misato grabbing my breast?<p>Misato: (moans in her sleep) ...Mmmm...<p>Ranma-chan: (thinks) Oh man, this ain't good. I gotta get out of here before anyone wakes up.<p>(Ranma-chan, as  carefully as she could, slowly lifted off Misato's hand and slipped  from under her and Urd. They moaned slightly, but stayed asleep, much  to Ranma-chan's relief. Quietly, she dragged herself out  of the room, clutching her head in pain.)<p>Ranma-chan: Ugh...  (thinks) Man...I haven't been this hungover in years...I can barely see  two feet ahead of me. I need to take a bath... (sees the hot springs)  Ah that'll do it. Keep forgetting this place has one.<p>(Ranma-chan opened the  door, began stripping off her clothes, and went to the next door that  lead to the springs. Right before she opened it, someone else did on  the other side. Setsuna, completely naked except for the towel she held  in her hand, started in shock as she faced the dazed Ranma-chan.  Ranma-chan's slowly widened as she came to a realization.<p>Ranma-chan: (grimace, thinks) This... is gonna hurt...<p><b>SLAP!</b><p>(Then the door shut in Ranma-chan's face.)<p>Setsuna: (angry, through the door) GET OUT!<p>Ranma-chan: (blushing furiously) Ow! Geez, sorry! I didn't mean to!<p>(As quickly as she  could, Ranma-chan back out of the changing room and into the hallway.)<p>Ranma-chan: (thinks) ARGH! Why me...<p>(Ranma-chan waited  uncomfortably outside of the room for Setsuna to come out. After a  moment, she did, fully clothed. Ranma-chan forced herself  to stare at the floor as she blushed again at the sight of  Setsuna. She instantly noticed Ranma-chan and narrowed her  eyes at the girl.)<p>Ranma-chan: Um, I'm really sorry, ah... (pauses)<p>Setsuna: (coldly) Setsuna.<p>Ranma-chan: Setsuna, I'm so sorry! It was a total accident!<p>Setsuna: ...<p>(A pregnant silence ensued before Ranma tried to further apologize again.)<p>Ranma-chan: I, uh, didn't see much, but y-you really have nice body! (cringes as soon as the words left his mouth)<p>Setsuna: ... (storms past Ranma, eyes blazing)<p>Ranma-chan: (smacks herself) ...good one Ranma, good one. If she didn't  hate me before, she definitely does now. At least I didn't say I was  better built this time...<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>(Ranma, sweating  slightly, started another round of katas outside in the yard of Hinata  Inn. After a couple more, he settled down and went inside to begin  cooking breakfast. Hotaru came into the room.)<p>Hotaru: Good morning Ranma-san.<p>Ranma: Hey Hotaru-chan. Morning. Where's everyone else?<p>Hotaru: They usually sleep in a lot. Only Motoko-senpai, Setsuna-mama (Ranma cringes), and me are awake this early.<p>Ranma: Oh yeah, I've meaning to ask ya...are Skuld and Urd really goddesses?<p>Hotaru: (nods) One time, when it was Urd-sama's turn to cook, she tried  to make it with magic and ended up blowing up the whole kitchen!<p>Ranma: Wow. (thinks) Blows up kitchens and gets drunk, not much of a goddess is she...?<p>(Setsuna walked in and  narrowed her eyes at Ranma before briskly deciding to ignore his  presence.)<p>Ranma: ...Uh, I cooked some breakfast if you're hungry, Setsuna-san.<p>Setsuna: (ignores Ranma) Hotaru, are you getting ready for school?<p>Hotaru: Yes, after I eat Ranma-san's breakfast.<p>Setsuna: Make sure you're not late.<p>Hotaru: Okay. (Setsuna walks out)<p>Ranma: (to self, grimacing) Yup, she definitely hates me...<p>Hotaru: What's that?<p>Ranma: Oh nothing. I have some morning classes to go to, I'll see ya later Hotaru.<p>Hotaru: Okay, bye Ranma-san.<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>(Setsuna stood alone in  the Gates of Time, her knuckles getting white from gripping her  staff in frustration.)<p>Setsuna: Why won't the timestream let me see Ranma? I can't see anything surrounding this man!<p>Urd: You're too serious Setsu-chan. Some people are just like that; he's a Chaos Entity.<p>Setsuna: U-Urd? How did you... never mind. What do you mean by Chaos Entity?<p>Urd: It's a term we gods use for people we can't mess with. Like control  their destiny and stuff. I don't even have clearance to see his past.<p>Setsuna: (narrows eyes) Then he could be a possible threat to Crystal Tokyo.<p>Urd: (incredulous look) You sure know how to get out the bad out of  anything. Sure, he could be a threat but that's like saying I'm a  threat just because I have the power.<p>Setsuna: You're a goddess.<p>Urd: I'm also half-demon. You never know...<p>Setsuna: ...<p>Urd: (grins) Hahaha, I'm just joking Setsu-chan! (slaps her on the back playfully) Yeesh, lighten up!<p>Setsuna: No. I do not like this man.<p>Urd: How come? Did something happen between you and Ranma? You usually don't hate anyone outright like this.<p>Setsuna: (blushes) ... (mutters) ...<p>Urd: Eh? What?<p>Setsuna: (still blushing) ... (mutters) ...<p>Urd: Speak up!<p>Setsuna: (screams out) HE PEEPED ON ME THEN SAID I LOOKED GOOD OKAY!<p>Urd: ...<p>Setsuna: (grimaces, thinks) Great, here it comes. I'm never going to here the end of this...<p>Urd: ...BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>(Ranma walked with  Hiroshi and Daisuke, whom had just finished eating their lunch in  between their break. Hiroshi and Daisuke were the only ones who knew of  Ranma's past. They had left for college years before Ranma left the  Tendo Dojo, so they're weren't exactly sure what happened with him and  the others. The duo had been surprised to see him in Tokyo, much less  attending Todai. They quickly reacquainted themselves and did not pry  into Ranma's past, for which Ranma was grateful for. Hiroshi and  Daisuke were both former ronins, people who had failed the entrance  exam and were trying again, but they recently passed. The trio saw a  group of high school girls walking towards them, chatting. It was quite  obvious that all the girls adored the one in the middle.)<p>Hiroshi: Looks at those cuties up there, Ranma!<p>Daisuke: The one in the middle is hot!<p>Ranma: They're okay.<p>(Ranma looked up at the sky and cringed as he saw it was going to rain soon.)<p>Ranma: (thinks) Man, I really gotta get to class soon before I get soaked. I knew I shoulda brought an umbrella!<p>Hiroshi: Oh, right, we forget who were talking to Daisuke. Ranma: the womanizing pervert.<p>Ranma: Hey!<p>Daisuke: Haha. Hey, watch this. (starts walking to the group, Hiroshi following)<p>Ranma: (rolls eyes) You're gonna get shot down. The middle one looks kinda tough.<p>(Ranma watched as his  two friends approached the girls with silly grins on their faces. After  a moment, the middle one attacked them with her umbrella, knocking them  both out. Ranma's eyes bulged. He knew they were going to fail, but he  didn't expect that. Ranma began sweating as the middle one walked  toward him with a suspicious look on her face.)<p>Girl: Go easy on this one Motoko-sama! He's kind of cute!<p>Motoko: Hmph. You there! (points umbrella at Ranma) You were intent on seducing my friends with your lackeys were you not?<p>Ranma: (shakes head) Uh, no. I don't even know those guys! (thinks) Crud, it's starting to sprinkle!<p>Daisuke: (mutters) ...traitor...<p>Motoko: Liar. (puts the umbrella tip against Ranma's collar)<p>Ranma: Umm... hey Hiroshi! Stop hitting on those girls already and get out of here! I can't hold her off for long!<p>(Motoko whipped around  to see a confused Hiroshi slowly getting up off the ground, next to  Motoko's friends.)<p>Hiroshi: Huh?<p>Motoko: Did you not learn your lesson yet!<p>(Ranma took the  distraction to dash past them and run towards cover before he got  completely soaked.)<p>Ranma: (while running) Thanks a lot Hiroshi, I owe ya one!<p>Hiroshi: Ranma, you bastard- ACK! (gets smacked with umbrella)<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>(Ranma walked back from  class, toward Hinata Inn, thankful that it had stopped raining. He  didn't completely make it unscathed though as his clothes were  definitely wet. Deciding to dry his clothes and put on new ones, Ranma  made his way toward the laundry room as he took of his shirt. Motoko  also happened to be there, clothed only in a towel wrapped around her  chest. She had been on a training trip for a whole week. Ranma opened  the door the the laundry room.)<p>Motoko: ...<p>Ranma: ...<p>Motoko: (blushing angrily) YOU PERVERTED STALKER!<p>(Ranma, face flushed  with embarrassment, shut the door quickly. Ranma stood there, not  really knowing what to do or where to run. It didn't take long for  Motoko to emerge, this time clothed in her hakama gi. She had a wooden  bokken in her hands.)<p>Motoko: YOU WILL PAY FOR STALKING ME!<p>Ranma: Wait! I'm the new manager here!<p>Motoko: LIAR!<p>(Ranma began dodging multiple strikes from Motoko.)<p>Ranma: I'm telling ya I live here! (thinks) This is getting  ridiculous. By the end of the day, this whole house is gonna hate me...<p>Motoko: (brows furrow) ... (thinks) Why can I not hit him?<p>(Eventually the commotion drew everyone there.)<p>Misato: What? Pervert? Where?<p>Urd: (smirks) Hey, it's Mr. Peeping Tom, Ranma!<p>Motoko: I KNEW IT!<p>Ranma: ...You're not helping, you know.<p>Urd: (winks at him) I know.<p>Setsuna: What's going on?<p>Motoko: This MAN has been stalking me! (points angrily at Ranma with her bokken)<p>Setsuna: ...<p>Ranma: (annoyed) I live here you crazy girl!<p>Motoko: (fumes) C-Crazy girl? How DARE you!<p>Misato: (sighs) Alright, alright, settle down. Motoko, it's true, Ranma is our new manager and cook.<p>Motoko: W-What? I will not allow it! I will not allow some perverted male to be our manager!<p>Ranma: How am <b><i>I</i></b> a pervert? You're the one wearing only a towel! That ain't my fault!<p>Motoko: (fumes) ...<p>Setsuna: (unable to repress a grin) He did walk in on me this morning when I was bathing in the hot springs...<p>Misato: What?<p>Ranma: Er...that was an accident!<p>Urd: Suuuure it was Ranma...<p>Motoko: I knew it I was right!<p>Ranma: Argh! (thinks) Why me! WHY!<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>(Ranma walked up onto  the roof after he decided to set things straight with Motoko. He had to  remind himself that he wasn't just some freeloader staying here against  his will. This was his job. He would make up with Motoko then handle  Setsuna later. She was going to be difficult. Ranma waited until after  she finished her kendo kata.)<p>Ranma: (thinks) She's actually pretty good for a girl. (out loud) Hey Motoko.<p>Motoko: (glares) What do you want?<p>Ranma: (scratches head bashfully) Um, I...uh, wanted to... (thinks)  Man, I HATE apologizing when it ain't my fault! And I'm pretty sure  it's not!<p>Motoko: What!<p>Ranma: I'm-sorry-for-calling-you-a-crazy-girl!<p>Motoko: (face flushes, thinks angrily) W-Why do I keep blushing? (out loud) Is that all you have to say, coward?<p>Ranma: WH-WHAT? Coward?<p>Motoko: (smirks) That's right. I remember you ran away from me earlier by using your friend as a scapegoat.<p>Ranma: (angry) That was 'cuz I didn't wanna get wet!<p>Motoko: You are afraid of getting a little wet? Ha!<p>Ranma: (glares) You know what, I take that back! I ain't sorry for calling you a crazy girl 'cuz you are!<p>(Motoko glares back at  him, staring into his eyes. After a moment, she begins blushing again.)<p>Motoko: (thinks) W-Why does my heart keep racing when I look at him?  Can it be that I...? NO! (out loud) I challenge you, Ranma Saotome, to  a duel! The winner of the duel gets to be manager!<p>Ranma: ...Fine!<p>Motoko: We will fight outside Hinata Inn, tomorrow, at noon!<p>Ranma: (thinks) Tomorrow is Saturday. I don't have class. (out loud)  Fine! You got a lot coming to ya if you think you can beat me!<p>Motoko: Do not take me lightly. I have been training all my life in the art of Shinmei Ryuu!<p>Ranma: Hmph, so what! That ain't nuthin compared to what I been through.<p>Motoko: We shall see.<p>Ranma: Whatever. (jumps off roof, thinks wryly) Gee, that went well. Went to apologize and ended up in a duel for my job.<p>(Motoko watched in  surprise. She quickly rushed to the edge of the roof to see Ranma  agilely flip around, land on his feet, and walk away like nothing.)<p>Motoko: (blinks, thinks) This Ranma Saotome is not to be underestimated...<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>Ranma: Dinner's ready!<p>(Silence met his call.)<p>Ranma: Um, dinner's ready!<p>(Silence once again.)<p>Ranma: ...<p>(Hotaru entered after a moment.)<p>Hotaru: (smiles meekly) Hello, Ranma-san. Looks delicious!<p>Ranma: Thanks. Uh, where is everyone?<p>Hotaru: I don't know. Motoko-senpai is here but she seems to be mad at you for some reason. Did something happen?<p>Ranma: (grimaced) Yeah. I went to the laundry room and she was only wearing a towel...you can guess what happened after that.<p>Hotaru: (gasps) Yes, that would make her angry. She doesn't like men very much.<p>Ranma: (wryly) I can see that. Reminds me of someone. You wouldn't  happen to know if she's attacked by a horde of boys every morning at  school?<p>Hotaru: (blinks) Um, no, I don't believe so. I think  she just doesn't like men because when her older sister got married she  gave up the family tradition.<p>Ranma: Family tradition?<p>Hotaru: To be a top-class kendoist. Motoko-senpai is very dedicated to  her Shinmei Ryuu. She even moved here so that she could attend a school  known for having an excellent kendo club.<p>Ranma: Oooh, I see.  That makes sense I guess. Still...she doesn't hafta take it out on  me... (thinks) She probably thinks I'm some perverted man here to take  her away from her art. (out loud, shrugs) Oh well, more food for us and  we get to spend some quality time together! (smiles) Right, Hotaru-chan?<p>(Hotaru blushed and nodded.)<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>(It was midnight.  Dinner was long over and there had been some leftovers. Ranma was  finding it difficult to judge how much he should cook each evening.  Mihoshi was off at her job and said she wasn't going to be back for a  couple days. Urd and Skuld were off visiting their sister, Misato was  working late, Setsuna was no where to be found, and Motoko was avoiding  him like he was diseased. Only Hotaru was there, which he didn't mind.  Ranma didn't have any problem eating all the food himself, but it was  annoying when he specifically made the food for other people and they  didn't show up. It was good to know that he would have the hot springs  all to himself however.)<p>Ranma: Ahh...this feels great. I could get used to this.<p>(The door to the changing room could be heard opening.)<p>Ranma: Wha...don't they know I'm in here? I did make that occupied sign and put it on the door.<p>(The shuffling of  clothes could be heard. Ranma began to get nervous as he felt an  imminent disaster pending.)<p>Ranma: (loudly) Uh...I'm in here! I'll be out in a sec!<p>(The door leading to  the springs opened, revealing a tired Misato. With a towel wrapped  around her chest and bags under her eyes, she trudged her way to the  waters. She didn't even take notice of Ranma.)<p>Ranma: (eyes wide) M-Misato? What are ya doing in here!<p>SPLASH<p>(Ranma watched as  Misato fell into the warm, steamy water face first. It was a few  seconds before a more energized Misato popped out. Ranma did his best  to avert his eyes from Misato's athletic figure as he quickly found a  towel to wrap around his waist.)<p>Misato: Ahhh, much better! It's so great having a hot springs in your backyard.<p>Ranma: (awkwardly backing out) Um, yeah...I'll be going... (thinks) Oh man, she reeks of alcohol.<p>Misato: Sure, sure, see ya in the mor-...R-RANMA? WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? You really are a pervert aren't you?<p>(Misato unconsciously  brought the towel closer to her chest as she gazed at Ranma in  surprise.)<p>Ranma: N-NO! I just through I'd try out the springs  'cuz I didn't think anyone would be using 'em this late at night!  Besides, I DID put a sign up saying I was in here ya know!<p>Misato: What? Really...? (shakes head to self) Yeah right!<p>Ranma: Alright, I'll prove it to ya!<p>(Ranma walked out and  came back a few seconds later with a sign in his hand. The sign read  "Occupied! Ranma's in here!" Misato stared at the sign for a  couple seconds before blinking in surprise.)<p>Misato: ...<p>Ranma: See!<p>Misato: ...oh.<p>(There was an awkward  silence. After a few moments, both residents slowly began to re-realize  the situation and consequently blushed furiously. Misato spoke first,  uncomfortably.)<p>Misato: I-I'm sorry about walking in you like  that. These late nights at work really get to me some times and I'm,  um, (coughs) a little tipsy right now.<p>(Ranma blinked at  Misato's statement. Were his ears deceiving him? Was this first time in  HISTORY where Ranma, the supposed pervert and womanizer, was RIGHT? A  female had apologized to HIM? Over the years, the young martial artist  had painfully learned the backwards knowledge that the man was always  in the wrong when a woman walked in on him by accident. This apology  was unheard of. At least, to Ranma it was.)<p>Ranma: Oh, uh, no problem. Don't worry about it...I'll see ya in the morning.<p>Misato: Y-Yeah...<p>(Ranma left Misato in  the hot springs alone to contemplate what just happened. Her face began  to flush again as she still had the images of Ranma's amazing body  embedded into her head. She would be having pleasant dreams tonight  indeed. Ranma, on the other hand, was thinking the exact opposite,  trying to think of anything except Misato's shapely body. Despite her  apology, he knew he was in for Hell in the morning.)<p>Ranma: (thinks) Oh man, just great...when Motoko and Setsuna hear about this, I'm dead. Why does this always happen to me!<p>(Ranma would be having nightmares of bonbori, spatulas, and mallets tonight.)<p>= = = = = = = = =<br/>Last Updated: 06/08/04<p>A/N: Shorter chapter than the first, but I thought this would be a good place to end it.<p>Changes: Slightly altered Ranma's reaction to getting slapped by Setsuna. Changed error in Chaos Entity explaination.<br/>
