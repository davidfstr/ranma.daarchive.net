</div><p>= = = = = = = = =<p>Manager Ranma 1/2<p>Episode 4<p>The Return of Mihoshi<br/>and Urd's Great Scheme!<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[  Ranma was in the front yard, practicing in the morning as usual. Hotaru  and Motoko had just left to go to school. ]<p>Ranma: Man...what a day Saturday was...but I feel like I'm forgetting something...<p>[ <i>FLASHBACK SOUND</i> ]<p><b><i>SLAP!</i><br/></b><br/>[ <i>FLASHBACK SOUND</i> ]<p>Ranma: (snaps fingers) Oh yeah! Geez, between everything that's happened I forgot to make up with Setsuna! I should do that...<p>[ Ranma cringed as he thought of her cold glare and menacing slap. ]<p>Ranma:  ...some time this week. (mumbles) 'sides, it was just an accident,  geez. She already didn't like me before I saw her naked for some  reason. (shrugs) Bah, whatev-aaaaaah?<p>[ The  pigtailed martial artist was cut off as a green beam tore through the  air just inches in front of his face. Whipping around, he faced the  source of the beam. ]<p>Ranma: What the hell was- eh? Banpei...kun?<p>[  Skuld made her appearance, smirking arrogantly, and gave a victory sign  at Ranma. ]<p>Skuld: That's right! Except now he's Banpei-kun X.023z, proto-type edition! Get ready Ranma!<p>Ranma: Wha? Rematch already?<p>[  Banpei answered with plasma beam to the face. Ranma was managed to  dodge by crack his torso backwards, his body forming a 90 degree angle,  limbo style. He winced as his spine made a crunching sound when he  straightened back up. Ranma growled at Banpei. ]<p>Ranma: Alright, fine! Bring it on!<p>[  The battle began. The fight played out much more differently than their  first confrontation. Banpei had changed strategies drastically from  hand-to-hand combat to long range projectile dog fights, to which  Banpei was actually quite good at with his new plasma beam. Ranma had  to blink at robot's intelligence. ]<p>Ranma: Say Skuld-chan, does this thing have a brain or something?<p>Skuld: Kind of. I programmed the AI so that he can learn and evolve from past mistakes. Why? Having trouble?<p>Ranma: (indignant) Ha! The day this tin can wins against me is the day I become your slave!<p>Skuld: (pouting) Oh yeah? We'll see about that! Go Banpei-kun! Execute: Ultimate Proximity Plasma Shot!<p>[  The robot rushed in suddenly with blinding speed, surprising Ranma for  a moment, but it stopped when it was inches in front of Ranma. Ranma  looked at the machine in wonder as it ceased all actions. ]<p>Ranma: Eh? What-<p><b>BOOOOOM!</b><p>[  Without warning, the robot exploded into pieces and caught Ranma in the  explosion as well. When the smoke cleared, Ranma was lying on the  ground, singed and burnt, with a painful expression across his  features. ]<p>Ranma: ...Ouch...th-that...wasn't fair...<p>Skuld:  Er, it wasn't supposed to do that. Looks like I still have a few kinks  to work out of this model. (shrugs shoulders) Oh well.<p>[  Purposely acting completely oblivious to the injured martial artist,  Skuld casually gathered up the pieces in her arms and made her way  inside Hinata Inn. ]<p>Skuld: Thanks for testing it out Ranma-niichan.<p>Ranma: ...N-no...problem...(blinks) Ranma-niichan?<p>[  Ranma he stood up and dusted himself off. He was about to follow Skuld  inside when, abruptly and out of no where, Ranma's sixth sense began  going off like crazy. He looked around in a hurried, panicked motion as  a feeling of dread welled up in his stomach. It was the feeling he  always got right before he said something stupid to Akane, a Happosai  grope while he was a girl, or a Ryoga encounter. ]<p>Ranma: (suspiciously thinks) Something bad's gonna happen. I can feel it...the sky?<p>[  Quickly, Ranma looked up and saw...nothing. Only a clear blue sky and a  shining star met his eyes. Odd. ]<p>Ranma: (blinks) Wait a sec...a star that bright, during this time of day, in a heavy metropolis like Tokyo? What...<p>Unknown: AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!<p>Ranma: What is that? Sounds like a girl? Hey...that looks like Mihoshi. Huh...M-MIHOSHI?<p>[  Ranma hastily tried run to where he thought he was going to fall, arms  out ready to catch her. ]<p>Mihoshi: AHHHH- OOF! Where...oh hi Ranma-san!<p>[ Ranma had managed to catch Mihoshi in his arms without much trouble. ]<p>Ranma: (sweatdrop forming) Uh, hi. Why were you falling out of the sky?<p>Mihoshi:  Oh that's because my ship was flying out of control and crashing to  Earth so I wanted to jump out and parachute to safety just like James Bond  in those Earthling movies! Yukinojo told me not to but it looked so fun  and I didn't know how else to escape! Only I don't think it worked for  some reason.<p><b>POOF!</b><p>[ Right when she said  that, Mihoshi's tiny parachute popped out of the back of her suit. It  was very small. The sweatdrop that had formed by Ranma's head grew. ]<p>Mihoshi: (cheery smile) Oh there it is!<p>Ranma: Um, I don't think that woulda saved you.<p>Mihoshi: Sure it would of! It's a special parachute I had Yukinojo make me!<p>Ranma: (scratching head) Oh, uh, I see. So, uh, where's your "spaceship"?<p>Mihoshi: Hmmm...I don't know. It should be around here some where!<p>Ranma: (dryly) Right...<p>Mihoshi: Oooh I see it! There it is!<p>Ranma: Huh?<p>[  Ranma looked up and saw a large metallic ship zooming down to the  ground. Right where they were. Ranma tried not to panic. ]<p>Ranma: What the hell? Oh man, hang on!<p>[  As Mihoshi tightened her grasp around his neck, Ranma vaulted himself  and his passenger to the side, right as the ship crashed into the  ground. An explosion of dust covered the area. Ranma coughed lightly as  the dust came while Mihoshi giggled. Gradually, the dust cleared,  revealing a large crater with Mihoshi's ship sticking out of the middle  of it. Ranma stood up slowly. He looked at the girl in his arms with an  incredulous look. ]<p>Ranma: You really were serious when you said your spaceship was crashing!<p>Mihoshi: (nods) Yup!<p>Ranma: Uh, so does that make you an alien or something? You look human to me.<p>Mihoshi: Oh I really am an alien! My species is just very similar to yours.<p>Ranma: Oh...okay.<p>Mihoshi: Wow, you're taking a lot better than most Earthlings do before I erase their memory.<p>Ranma:  (shrugs) What can I say, when you father's a panda and you change  genders with cold water, you tend to have a more open mind. (blinks)  Wait, did you just say erase their memory?<p>[ As Ranma  looked into Mihoshi's eyes, he could see the gears in her brain slowly  putting two and two together. Mihoshi's eyes shot wide open with panic.  ]<p>Mihoshi: Oh no, oh no! You found out! Now I have to erase your memory!<p>Ranma: H-Hey, wait a sec! I don't want my memory to be erased!<p>Mihoshi: B-But if I don't I'll get in big trouble a-and...and...WAAAAAAH!<p>[  Before Ranma could calm her down, Skuld, Misato, and Urd began to  trickle out to see what all the commotion was about. ]<p>Skuld: Mihoshi?<p>Misato: What's going on here? (suspicious) Why is Mihoshi in your arms crying, Ranma?<p>Urd: (wryly) Wow, making grown girls cry. You're a monster Ranma!<p>[ Ranma instantly grimaced. ]<p>Ranma: Er, it's not what you think!<p>[  Ranma quickly let go of Mihoshi who hopped back onto who own feet. Her  eyes were still filled with tears. The blond alien turned Urd. ]<p>Mihoshi: What should I do Urd-san? I don't want to have to erase Ranma-san's memory!<p>Urd: (shrugs) Ah don't worry about it. You can trust Ranma.<p>Mihoshi: A-Are you sure?<p>Urd: Yeah.<p>Mihoshi: Oh ok. Thank goodness! (turns to Ranma with a smile) Isn't that good Ranma-san?<p>Ranma: (sweatdrops) Um, yeah.<p>Misato: (haggard) Ugh, it's too early for this. I'm going back to sleep.<p>Ranma: But what are we gonna do about this ship- what the heck? Where'd it go?<p>[  The ship was completely gone. Although the crater was there, the  spaceship was no where to be found. Skuld hopped into the crater and  knocked her hand in the air around the center of the crater. When she  did so, a clanking sound was emitted. ]<p>Skuld: (curiously) Hmm not bad! You mortals can some times come up with such interesting technology.<p>Ranma: Huh? What was that?<p>Mihoshi: Oh that was just my ship. It went camouflage. Isn't that neat!<p>Ranma: Whoa.<p>[  The residents decided to go back inside because it was still rather  earlier. Ranma was about to follow but he felt an arm on his shoulder.  He looked over to see Urd leaning against him with a sly grin.  Her chest was pressing softly against his side. ]<p>Ranma: (nervous) What?<p>Urd: You know Ranma, technically I just saved you.<p>Ranma: Uh, I guess so.<p>Urd: That means you owe me!<p>Ranma: ... (thinks) I swear, she like a Nabiki plus Shampoo times twenty! (sighs, out loud) Okay, what do you want Urd?<p>[ Urd's grin widened. She poked Ranma in the chest and twirled her finger. ]<p>Urd: Weeeeeeellll...<p>[ She leaned in close to him and whispered into his ear. ]<p>Urd: ...and then...<p>Ranma: Huh...<p>[  As Urd told him her proposition, Ranma's expression gradually began  turning more and more confused. ]<p>Ranma: ...that's it?<p>Urd:  Yup, that's it. (thinks) Bwahaha, this'll definitely lighten up  Setsuna. It'll help her get out all that pent up frustration haha.<p>Ranma: Uh, okay. (thinks) She's definitely up to something...<p>Urd: Oh, and make sure I'm there when do it!<p>Ranma: Okay. I don't really get it but whatever.<p>Urd: Trust me, Setsuna will definitely get it.<p>[ Ranma narrowed his eyes at Urd but said nothing. ]<p>Ranma: (thinks) Gee, why do I have a bad feeling about this?<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[ Ranma put on his shoes and opened the door to walk out. ]<p>Mihoshi: Where are you going Ranma-san?<p>Ranma: Gonna pick up some groceries from the store.<p>Mihoshi: Oh! Can I come too? I want to buy some pocky! Earth's candy is really delicious!<p>Ranma: (scratching head) Sure I guess.<p>Mihoshi: (bubbly) Great! It's always fun shopping with someone!<p>Ranma: (thinks) She's so cheerful. (to Mihoshi) Y'know, you don't hafta call me Ranma-san. Just Ranma is fine.<p>Mihoshi: Okay Ranma!<p>[  In the beginning, both were silent as they made their way to the store.  Ranma decided to strike up a conversation because he was rather curious  about a couple of things. This was, after all, his first alien  encounter. ]<p>Ranma: What's your real job?<p>Mihoshi: I'm a police detective.<p>[ Ranma's stared blankly at her for a second before chuckling. ]<p>Ranma: Haha, good one. No seriously though, what's your job?<p>Mihoshi: But I told you. I'm a police detective!<p>Ranma: Are you serious?<p>Mihoshi: Yup!<p>[ Mihoshi took out her badge and showed it to him. Ranma read it out loud. ]<p>Ranma: Galaxy Police Detective...1st Class? (gives her a strange look)<p>Mihoshi: (giggles) People always give me that look when I show them my badge. (pondering expression) I don't know why though.<p>[  A sweatdrop appeared by Ranma's forehead. It wasn't much longer before  they made it to the super market. Ranma picked up various cooking  materials and ingredients while Mihoshi got a box of pocky. They were  heading toward the counter to pay when two masked men ran into the  store holding guns. ]<p>Robber 1: EVERYONE FREEZE! THIS IS A STICK UP!<p>[  While his partner made his announcement, the other masked man grabbed  Mihoshi roughly and pointed his gun at her. ]<p>Robber 2: If anyone tries any hero stuff the girl gets it!<p>Mihoshi: Wh-wha...WAAAAAAAH!<p>[  The cry pierced everyone's heads causing them to plug their ears with  their hands. ]<p>Robber 2: S-STOP THAT OR ELSE!<p>Mihoshi: (sniffs) B-But...<p>Ranma: (growls) You guys are making a big mistake...<p>Robber 1: Didn't you hear what my partner said? If you try any funny stuff the blond gets it!<p>Ranma: Grrr...<p>Mihoshi: R-Ranma, what do I do- (stops crying suddenly) Oh look! Ten yen.<p>[  Some how, without seemingly even trying, Mihoshi wormed her way out of  the robber's grasp and bent over to pick up the coin. She then whipped  back up and head butted her would-be captor in the forehead with an  innocent expression on her face. The robber fell to the ground,  clutching his face in agony. ]<p>Mihoshi: (innocently) Did anyone drop this?<p>Robber 1: WH-WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE-<p>Ranma: You're dead buddy!<p>[  Ranma took advantage of the distraction and rushed the criminal who was  caught off guard. Ranma kneed the man in the stomach and followed up  with an uppercut to the chin, sending his opponent flying into the  ground. Ranma turned to Mihoshi with a surprised look. ]<p>Ranma: Wow, good job Mihoshi! I never knew you had it in ya!<p>Mihoshi: Had what in me?<p>[ A sweatdrop formed again behind Ranma's head. ]<p>Ranma: Er...nevermind. Let's go back.<p>[  Mihoshi and Ranma engaged in minor small talk on the way back, but, for  the most part, they were silent. Ranma was quietly wondering about what  just happened. ]<p>Ranma: (thinks) Is she serious? The way she did  it seemed like accident but I coulda swore, for just a second, she  looked like a really good martial artist...<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[  Ranma cleaned up the last of the dishes. Motoko came in looking for  leftovers. ]<p>Ranma: Yo. How ya feeling?<p>[  Motoko stared at him without expression for a moment before replying in  an even tone. ]<p>Motoko: Fine. Why?<p>Ranma: (shrugs) Just curious. Wondering when your gonna be at full strength so we can fight again.<p>Motoko: (raises eyebrow) Why are you so eager to battle with me?<p>Ranma:  I dunno, I just haven't had a good sparring partner in a while.  (thinks) Except for that damn robot, but I still prefer fighting humans  more.<p>Motoko: I see. Well I went through most of the day at school without many problems. I should be ready soon.<p>Ranma: Cool.<p>[  Ranma walked out into the living room, intending to head over to clean  the hot springs. Urd was watching TV while Setsuna was helping Hotaru  with her homework. That surprised Ranma. Setsuna was like a ghost,  popping in whenever she felt like it then disappearing without a word.  He didn't think she'd be the type to engaged in such an activity with  Hotaru. He was about to pass through the room when he saw Urd motioning  at him. Ranma gave her a questioning look and Urd replied by pointing  at Setsuna and winking. ]<p>Ranma: (mutters) Now? Ah whatever...at least she didn't make me go out with her on a date or anything.<p>[ Walking over to Setsuna and Hotaru, he waved at them. ]<p>Ranma: Heya.<p>Hotaru: (smiles) Hello, Ranma-san.<p>[ Setsuna remained silent, only giving him a cold gaze. Ranma's brow twitched. ]<p>Ranma: (thinks) She sure does hold grudges don't she...<p>Setsuna:  (thinks) Until I am absolutely sure of this man's intentions and his  effect on Crystal Tokyo, I must remain guarded at all times.<p>[ Ranma coughed nervously in his hand before steeling himself for something. ]<p>Ranma: So Setsuna, whatcha doing?<p>Setsuna: I was helping Hotaru with her homework until you so rudely interrupted.<p>[ Urd grinned for some reason. ]<p>Ranma:  Ah ok, geez. You know, you should lighten up some. I mean, uh, if I  really wanted to destroy Crystal Tokyo, I would of did it already.<p>[  Hotaru and Setsuna eyes widened and gasped in shock while Urd stifled a  laugh. Ranma simply looked on with a bewildered expression, not really  knowing what the big deal was. ]<p>Setsuna: HOW DID YOU KNOW?<p>Hotaru: (teary eyed) R-Ranma-san...please, say it isn't so! (thinks) Ranma-san can't be our enemy, he just can't!<p>Ranma: (sweating) Uh, know what? (notices Hotaru's tears) Er, why are you crying Hotaru-chan?<p>[  Ranma moved in to comfort her, but Setsuna stepped in front, an icey  glare on her features. ]<p>Setsuna: Stay back!<p>Ranma: Uh what did I do?<p>Setsuna: I knew you were trouble from the moment I laid eyes on you!<p>[  From out of know where, Setsuna pulled out a large staff and took a  swipe at Ranma. Surprised, Ranma blocked the attack and hopped back. ]<p>Ranma: H-Hey wait a minute!<p>[  Setsuna ignored Ranma's pleas and continued to attack him ferociously.  The pigtailed manager dodged the staff strikes with relative ease, but  the surroundings were taking a beating. Her staff crashed into a nearby  lamp, shattering it. ]<p>Ranma: C'mon, cut it out! I'm gonna hafta fix all this ya know!<p>Setsuna: QUIET!<p>Ranma: Argh!<p>Hotaru: ...(sniffs)...R-Ranma-san...(sniffs)...<p>[  Urd, who had been fighting for her life not to burst out in a fit of  laughter, saw Hotaru's tears. Urd walked over to, put a hand on her  head consolingly, and whispered something in her ear. As Urd spoke,  Hotaru's eyes lit up and stopped sniffling. ]<p>Hotaru: R-Really?<p>Urd: (nods) Really.<p>[  A wave of euphoria rushed through Hotaru as she rubbed away her tears  with a look of pure relief. ]<p>Hotaru: Th-thank goodness...<p>Urd: (bashfully) Sorry 'bout that kiddo, forgot about you.<p>[  Ranma and Setsuna were oblivious to their conversation as the man  continued defend himself against Setsuna. She had managed to get a few  blows in but nothing serious thus far. He looked at Setsuna with an  irritated scowl. ]<p>Ranma: Will you just listen to me for a sec- ARGH! That's coming out of your rent just so you know! Man, that's it!<p>[  Halting in his retreat, Ranma stood his ground as he cast his opponent  a determined gaze. When Setsuna made another pass at him, Ranma dodged  low and rushed in close. He slid behind her and grabbed her staff in  his hand while wrapping an arm around her waist, locking in her arms.  She struggled to get out of his grasp. ]<p>Setsuna: Let go of me! (thinks) If only I'd had time to transform!<p>Ranma: (shaking head) Not until you calm down. I'm telling you I don't even know what Crystal Tokyo is!<p>Setsuna: Do you really think I'd believe your lies?<p>[ Ranma then turned to Urd with a glare. ]<p>Ranma: This is all your fault Urd!<p>Urd: ...!<p>[ Setsuna, despite her rage, had to give Urd a strange look. ]<p>Setsuna: What...<p>Ranma: C'mon Urd, tell her!<p>Urd: Hahaha...okay, okay. It's true Setsu-chan. I told him to say all that stuff about Crystal Tokyo.<p>Setsuna: ...what?<p>[  Setsuna examined Urd who had been rolling on the floor, cracking up,  and finally put it all together. Her icey glare was now focused on the  goddess before her. ]<p>Setsuna: YOU! You told him to say all those things?<p>Urd: Hahaha- y-yeah. Great wasn't it? Hahahaha!<p>Setsuna: So he knows nothing of... (trails off)<p>Urd: (nods) Yup. See now, doesn't it feel good to get it all out?<p>Setsuna: (growls) Urd...<p>Ranma:  (mutters) Hmph, I told ya. Shoulda listened to me sooner. Why don't  women ever listen to me when I'm trying to tell 'em stuff? Sheesh, now  I hafta clean up all this...<p>[ Setsuna tried not to look  embarrassed. She then realized that she was still within his firm  embrace. Their bodies were gently pressing up against one another. She  could feel the warmth coming from him. How long had it been since she  had been in the arms of a man? How long since she had felt the  affections of another? A thousand years? Two thousand years? ]<p>Setsuna: ... (thinks) H-He is strong...<p>[  It took her a moment to regain her usual calm, stoic composure as she  politely coughed. ]<p>Setsuna: I'm...sorry. Forgive me for jumping to conclusions. Can you please let go of me now?<p>[ Ranma blinked, just realizing their situation as well, and let go quickly. ]<p>Ranma: Uh, yeah, no prob.<p>[ Urd grinned. ]<p>Urd: Why, is that a blush coming from the Ice Queen Setsuna?<p>Setsuna: (growls) Urd...<p>[  Ranma blinked again in surprise. Setsuna blushing? He glanced her and  did indeed see that her face was slightly flushed. That couldn't be  right. ]<p>Ranma: Hey, you okay there Setsuna? Did the fight tire you out too much? You should lay down and rest.<p>[  Ranma placed his hand on her shoulder. She nearly jumped out of her  skin, startled at his touch. The woman quickly slapped away his hand  and turned her back to him, hiding her face. ]<p>Setsuna: I-I am  fine! Don't concern yourself with me. Don't think that this means I  forgive you for walking in on me that one time. (thinks) I'll get you  for this Urd...<p>Ranma: (rubbing back of his head) Eh, okay...  (thinks) Is this good or bad? For some reason, I don't think she hates  me as much as before but I dunno...<p>[ With that, Setsuna  stormed out of the room. Ranma was about to turn to Urd but was  abruptly caught off guard as a bundle of heat smashed into him and  wrapped its arms around the young martial artist. Ranma looked down,  surprised, to see Hotaru hugging him, tears welled up in her eyes. She  was smiling with relief. ]<p>Hotaru: I-I'm so glad! I-I thought I was going to have to fight you...<p>Ranma: Eh? Why would you have to do that?<p>[  Hotaru didn't say anything, only nuzzled herself deeper into Ranma's  chest. Ranma rubbed the back of his head in confusion again, not  knowing why she reacting in such a way. He ruffled her hair and put his  hands on her shoulders, gently placing her at arms length. ]<p>Ranma:  (smiling) Hotaru-chan, you know I'd never do anything to hurt you. Now,  why don't I help you with that homework you got there?<p>[  Hotaru looked up, saw the gentle caring in his eyes, and nodded at him  with a smile. ]<p>Hotaru: S-Sorry for acting like that Ranma-san.<p>Ranma: Heh, don't worry about it.<p>[  As soon as Hotaru turned away, Ranma instantly glared at Urd angrily in  a look that said "This is all your fault". The goddess held up her  hands defensively with a shy smile. ]<p>Urd: H-Hey, sorry, I  forgot about her okay? I didn't mean that to happen. And besides, you  just helped Setsu-chan with some physical therapy!<p>Ranma: (growls) Urrrrrdddd...<p>Urd: Oh look at the time! Gotta go!<p>[ Urd made haste and soon vanished from the room. ]<p>Ranma: (thinks) Damn Urd, I gotta be more careful around her. I'll get back at her for this one day...<p>= = = = = = = = =</p><p>A/N: I hope no one was too out of characters.</p>
