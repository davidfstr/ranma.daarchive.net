</div><p>Itadakimasu: means "I'll be back", used when leaving the house such as going to work or school.<p>Itterasshai:  used to a family member when he or she leaves the house. Used to  express their hope that family members will come back to the house  safely. Reply to Ittekimasu.</p><p>Disclaimer:</p><p>= = = = = = = = =<p>Manager Ranma 1/2<p>Episode 5<p>A Day at Work<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[  A lone figure stood a top of a cliff, his cloak blowing wildly in the  wind. The man wore a yellow and black bandanna and carried a large pack  on his back with a red bamboo umbrella atop it. He looked out across  the city below with a distant gaze. ]<p>Unknown: ...I wonder if he still lives in Japan. How long has it been since he disappeared? One year? Two years?<p>[ The man sighed and his features became saddened. ]<p>Unknown:  If you're still here, I will find you. You won't let you get away from  me that easily. I haven't finished settling things with you just yet.<p>[ He clenched his fist tight. ]<p>Unknown: Prepare yourself, I am coming for you...Ranma...<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[ Ranma sneezed. ]<p>Hotaru: Are you okay, Ranma-san?<p>Ranma: (rubs his nose) Yeah.<p>[  Misato walked into the kitchen, looking incredibly haggard and tired,  more so than usual. ]<p>Hotaru: Good morning, Misato-san.<p>Misato: Morning...ugh...<p>Ranma: (raises an eyebrow) You look like crap Misato.<p>Misato: Gee, thanks Ranma. That makes me feel a lot better...(groans)...<p>Ranma: I'm serious. Are you okay?<p>Hotaru: (nods) You look a bit pale Misato-san.<p>Misato: Don't worry about me, I'm fine.<p>[  Misato stumbled into the refrigerator, took out a beer, and chugged it  down. Ranma and Hotaru sweatdropped at this. Oddly, Misato didn't  appear to gain a burst of energy like she usually did. ]<p>Ranma:  (frowns, thinks) I ain't no doctor or nuthin, but I think this is  serious. She's in really bad shape. Her body is completely off balance  and her ki is unstable. (to Misato) You should go back to sleep and  rest some more.<p>Misato: I wish I could but I can't. I have to attend a special meeting right now. (mutters) ...Stupid Ikari. I hate that guy...<p>Ranma: Why don't ya call in sick then?</p><p>Misato: Can't.</p><p>Ranma: Eh, it won't kill ya if ya miss a day of work.<p>Misato: (annoyed) Ranma, please! I can take care of myself.<p>Ranma: ...Hmph, fine, whatever. I don't really care either way.<p>Misato: Fine by me.<p>[  Ranma's brow twitched in irritation. Although he wouldn't admit it, he  really didn't like being so casually brushed off, especially by a  female. He was Ranma Saotome, a top class martial artist, who'd  formerly had over four beautiful fiancés all at the same time. That  inevitably has some effect on a man's ego. It took all of Ranma's  maturity not to relapse and lash out in childish insults. Oblivious to  this, Misato glanced at her watch and her eyes widened. ]<p>Misato: DAMN IT! I'M LATE!<p>[  Misato let out numerous swears before rushing out the door. Seconds  later, the sound of screeching tires could be heard. Ranma stared off  vaguely in her direction with a worried frown. ]<p>Hotaru: What's wrong Ranma-san?<p>Ranma: Huh? Oh, it's just Misato. I think her body is sick.<p>Hotaru: (frowns) Oh no! That's not very good.<p>Ranma: (nods) Yeah, it ain't. Why does she work anyways? I mean, doesn't she own this place?<p>Hotaru:  (shakes head) She does kind of, but not exactly. It's her family's. I  think they forced it on to her. Whenever I ask about it she grumbles a  lot.<p>Ranma: Oh. Do ya know where she works?<p>Hotaru: For the government I believe.<p>Ranma: Government huh? Weird, she don't seem the type to work at that kind of place.<p>Hotaru: Oh, look! Misato-san forgot her purse. (points at purse on the table)<p>Ranma: That dummy. Now she's not gonna have money to eat.<p>Hotaru: That's not good. I don't think Misato-san has been eating much lately.<p>Ranma: Yeah, me neither. Hmm...I'm gonna go bring her her purse.<p>Hotaru: That's a good idea. But what if it's far?<p>Ranma: That ain't a problem, I run fast. Trust me. I'm gonna go. Have fun at school Hotaru-chan!<p>[ Ranma stood up, grabbed the purse, and headed out to the door. ]<p>Hotaru: Okay. Itterasshai!<p>[  Ranma stopped and glanced at Hotaru, surprised for some reason. He  didn't know why, but when she said that, it felt...nice. Like he had  somewhere to come back to again. Ranma smiled. ]<p>Ranma: Itadakimasu!<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>Ranma: Hmm...NERV Headquarters huh?<p>[  Ranma peeked around the corner and looked at the enormous pyramid  shaped building before him. ]<p>Ranma: I wonder if I should just walk up and give them the purse? But...<p>[  At the entrance, entrance there were three, stern looking guards.  Although not in their hands, they had guns at their sides. ]<p>Ranma:  Geez, the security this place has is crazy! I can't believe Misato  works at a place like this. They'd probably even arrest me if I gave  them Misato's purse, thinking I mugged her or something. What the heck  am I doing this for...Should I go back?<p>[  He thought about it for a second, Misato's pale face coming to mind,  and he shook his head with a sigh. ]<p>Ranma: Ah whatever, I'm already over here.<p>[ Ranma whipped out a large black cloth and prepared his Umisen-ken technique. ]<p>Ranma: Goshin Dai Ryü Sei Fu!<p>[  He spun around and encircled himself in the blanket. When the blanket  completely engulfed, Ranma suddenly vanished from view. ]<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[  Now inside, Ranma got to a point where he figured it'd be safe to walk  around under disguise. After finding a locker room, he broke inside one  and changed into the NERV uniform. It was a snug fit, but fit  nonetheless. Ranma was surprised at the place Misato worked in for it  seemed like one of those top secret government places. Every where he  went he either saw soldiers in uniform or scientists in lab coats. He  guessed she acted differently when she worked? ]<p>Ranma: Now to find Misato. Hmm...<p>[  Ranma saw a woman with short brown hair getting a drink out of the  vending machine. He walked over to her. ]<p>Ranma: Hey.<p>Brunette: Um, h-hi. (thinks) He's cute...<p>Ranma: Do you know where uh Katsuragi-san is? I have a message to deliver to her.<p>Brunette: Captain Katsuragi? Yes, I do.<p>Ranma: Cool, could you show me where she is?<p>Brunette: Okay.<p>Ranma: Great, thanks!<p>[ They began walking down the hallway. ]<p>Brunette: (shyly) Um, my name is Maya. What's yours?<p>Ranma: (thinks) Should I tell her? Ah who cares. (out loud) Ranma.<p>Ritsuko: Maya, have you finished the diagnostics on the specimen that just came?<p>[ A blond scientist came into view. ]<p>Maya: Oh, Ritsuko-senpai! (nods) Yes, I have.<p>Ritsuko: (notices Ranma) Who are you? This area is for Class 3 clearance only. I haven't seen you around here before.<p>Ranma: I'm just here to deliver a message to, um, Captain Katsuragi. Then I'll be going.<p>Ritsuko: I see. I am heading that way as well.<p>Ranma:  (thinks, grimacing) Ugh, great. Maya's fine, but I can tell this woman  wouldn't hesitate one second to call security on me.<p>[  The three eventually came to a room filled with controlled panels.  Misato was there, holding a cup of coffee and looking annoyed, with a  pony-tailed man who was smiling slyly. Misato looked up and saw Ritsuko  first. ]<p>Misato: (irritated) Oi, Ritsu, are you sure we have to work him?<p>Man: (mockingly sad) Aw, you don't want me here? How cruel.<p>Ritsuko: (small smile, shaking her head) Just bear with it for a little while longer and Kaji will be out of your hair.<p>Kaji: Oh Maya-chan, nice to see you again!<p>Maya: H-Hello Kaji-san.<p>Misato: (annoyed) You just have to flirt with every female in sight don't you? (blinks) Who's that? (points at Ranma)<p>Ranma: Yo, Misato. It's me.<p>Misato: Huh? Wait a second...RANMA? (shocked) What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be in here!<p>Ritsuko: (raises an eyebrow) You know this man personally?<p>Ranma: Well you forgot your purse at home so I came here to give it to you.<p>[ Everyone gaped at Ranma. ]<p>Ritsuko: To come all this way just because you forgot your purse?<p>Kaji: (shocked) Is he your...<p>Misato: No! He's-<p>[  Misato stopped herself when she noticed the stunned look on Kaji's  face. Grinning, she strutted over to Ranma and clung to his arm  affectionately. ]<p>Misato: Why thank you for bringing my purse honey!<p>Ranma: (nervously confused) Huh? What're you-OOF!<p>[  Ranma was cut off as Misato's elbow somehow found itself planted in his  stomach. Ranma glanced at Misato and saw that she was glaring at him,  silently telling him to play along. ]<p>Ranma: Uh, right, no prob. (whispers) Watcha do that for!<p>Misato: (whispers back) Just play along! I'll tell you later.<p>Ranma: (whispers) Fine. But ya didn't hafta hit me so hard, geez...<p>Misato: (whispers) Oh quit whining.<p>Ranma: (whispers rather loudly) I ain't whining!<p>[  Ranma and Misato suddenly realized they had an audience and quickly  tried to compose themselves. Although the other two didn't seem notice  anything too strange, Ritsuko did. ]<p>Ritsuko: Quite a catch you have there. I'm surprised you were able to hide him from us.<p>Kaji: You two are...living together?<p>Misato: Yup.<p>Ritsuko: How long have you two known each other?<p>Misato: Oh I'd say about...half a year. Isn't that right sweety?<p>[ Ranma flinched. ]<p>Ranma: R-Right.<p>[ Behind their view, Misato was pinching him in the side. ]<p>Ritsuko: (slyly) So, what do you like best about Misato, Ranma?<p>Ranma: (sweating) Uh well...<p>[  If the world's fate rested on Ranma's shoulders in a poker game, the  world would end. He literally couldn't lie to save his own life. ]<p>Ranma:  (slowly) She's...she's honest. She doesn't pretend to be someone she's  not. She never hides who she really is (wryly adds) even though it  ain't always pretty.<p>[  Misato, although she was smiling on the outside, was a bit confused on  the inside. Ranma had sounded completely honest when he had said that,  which got her pondering if his words had some truth in it. He didn't  seem the type to be good at lying. Misato couldn't help but blush, just  slightly. ]<p>Ritsuko: (nods) That sounds true enough. (to Misato) So, how is he?<p>Misato: How is he? What- OH!<p>[  Misato glanced at Kaji again before answering. He had a nonchalant  facade equipped, but Misato could see right through it. He definitely  wanted to know. Misato let an evil grin creep up on her face. While  these vicious thoughts were going through Misato's head, Ranma simply  looked bewildered. ]<p>Misato: He's...<p>[ They leaned in close. ]<p>Misato: <i>WONDERFUL</i>! Probably the best I've ever had! (grins) His name isn't Ranma for nothing!<p>Ritsuko:  (slight blush) Oh? (thinks) Is she being serious? He is rather  handsome...I wouldn't be surprised if she jumped him on the first date  actually.<p>Maya: (blushing) O-Oh my!<p>Kaji: ...<p>Misato:  (smirking, thinks) Payback's a bi#$% isn't it Kaji? (to Ranma) Well  honey, why don't we go out somewhere since I haven't eaten yet. I'm  taking my break now guys, I'll be back.<p>[  Misato, still clinging to a dazed Ranma, dragged him out of the room  and into the hallways. ]<p>Ranma: I dun get it.<p>Misato: (smirks) You'll understand when your older.<p>Ranma: Oka- HEY! Don't treat me like a kid!<p>Misato: But you are a kid in "certain" physical exercises aren't you?<p>Ranma: Huh?<p>Misato: You know, when a guy and a girl like each other... (winks)<p>Ranma: Huh?<p>[ Misato wanted to smack herself. ]<p>Misato: (thinks) I swear, Ranma can be so dense some times. (to Ranma) <b>SEX</b>, RANMA, <b>SEX</b>! <i>Have you done it!</i><p>[ Ranma's face immediately went completely red. ]<p>Misato: (smirks again) Heh, see. You are a kid. It's okay though, I like 'em innocent and cute like that.<p>Ranma: H-Hey! I never said I was a virgin!<p>Misato: (blinks) You mean you're not?<p>Ranma: (uncomfortable, looks away) No, I'm not.<p>Misato: Oh.<p>[ Ranma realized that she was still clinging to his arm. ]<p>Ranma: Um, I think you can let go of my arm now.<p>Misato:  (surprised) Oh, sorry. Thanks for playing along with me back there by  the way. (angry) I just wanted to piss off that bastard Kaji.<p>Ranma: Old boyfriend or something?<p>Misato: Yeah. (blinks) Say, why ARE you here anyways? And how the heck did you get in here?<p>Ranma:  I told ya, I came back to give you your purse. As for getting in here  (shrugs) I just used a couple secret martial arts techniques to sneak  in.<p>[ Misato cast Ranma a strange look. ]<p>Misato: Secret martial arts tech...(shakes head) never mind. You come all this way just to drop my purse off?<p>Ranma: (nods) I was worried because I thought you wouldn't have any money to eat.<p>Misato:  (chuckles) Why Ranma, I didn't know you cared! I guess you just can't  get enough of my feminine charms you got peek off back there in the hot  springs huh?<p>Ranma: (flushes slightly) Uh, n-no! H-Ha! It's not that. (smirks) Heh, besides, I see <i>much</i> more "feminine charms" whenever I look in a mirror if ya haven't noticed, so why would I be impressed by yours?<p>[ Misato stopped laughing. ]<p>Misato: (fumes angrily) What? Why you...<p>[  Misato didn't get to finish as she suddenly tripped on her own feet and  stumbled toward the ground. Ranma was instantly at her side and caught  her in mid-air. ]<p>Ranma: (concerned) You okay?<p>Misato: Y-Yeah, just a little dazed...I don't know what just happened.<p>Ranma:  (shakes head) This is why I really came. Your suffering from light  malnutrition. I noticed it this morning. You better start eating more  Misato.<p>Misato: M-Maybe you're right...<p>[  Gradually, she regained some of her strength and was able to stand on  her own fit. ]<p>Ranma: I think ya should take the day off.<p>Misato: (shakes head) No, I can't. I-I'll just go have a big lunch and I'll be fine.<p>Ranma: I dunno...<p>Misato: Oh! I know! (grins) Why don't you take me out to eat Ranma <i>honey</i>!<p>[  Misato mischievously snaked her arms around Ranma's arm and leaned into  him, giving the young man a rather nice downward view of her  chest. Naturally, he began sweating a bit. ]<p>Ranma: (thinks) This is the only way I'm going to be able to make sure she eats right. (to Misato) Uh, o-okay I guess.<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>[  Ranma and Misato were seated in a booth at an average, but nice  restaurant. They were both reading their menus. Misato, who was  sneaking in glances at Ranma while he wasn't looking, was rather happy  with herself as she had landed herself into such a sweet  situation. The waitress came and asked for their orders. ]<p>Misato: I'll have the number 15 lunch box.<p>Waitress: Okay. Anything to drink with that?<p>Misato: Just coffee. Black.<p>Waitress: Okay.<p>[  The waitress turned to Ranma and, as if noticing him for the first  time, her eyes widened slightly as she noticed how handsome her  customer was. She leaned in closer to him, smiled sweetly, and asked  him for his order. ]<p>Waitress: And what can I get for you today, sir?<p>Ranma: I'll have...this, this, this, and this. And some water.<p>Waitress: (blinks) Th-that's almost half the menu! Are you sure?<p>Ranma: (nods) Yup. I'm a big boy.<p>Waitress: (smile returns) Oh, is that so? Okay then, I'll be right back with your orders.<p>[  The waitress lightly touched Ranma's shoulder as she spoke, but he  didn't seem to notice. Misato, of course, noticed the obvious gesture,  much to her irritation, but refrained from saying anything. She  wondered how, if Ranma truly wasn't a virgin, could he be so ignorant  of a women and sex? ]<p>Misato: (jokingly) Hungry Ranma?<p>Ranma: (bashfully) Heh, yup.<p>Misato: Say, I don't think I've ever actually asked you this before: are you single Ranma?<p>Ranma: Huh? Oh, um, yeah.<p>Misato: (thinks) Thank god! (to Ranma) Oh, I see. What happened to your last girlfriend?<p>Ranma: My last girlfriend...?<p>Misato: (nods) C'mon, I told you about Kaji. Why'd you two break up?<p>Ranma: (coughs uncomfortably) Uh, well, it just wasn't working out...oh look, foods ready!<p>Misato: (thinks) That was vague...<p>Waitress: Here are your orders. Call me if you need anything (winks) Okay handsome?<p>[  Ranma simply nodded, having food in his mouth. None of this was missed  by Misato. ]<p>Misato: (mutters) Slut...<p>Ranma: What?<p>Misato: Nothing.<p>Ranma: Oh okay.<p>[  While Misato ate her meal, she watched, stunned with a sweatdrop, as a  hungry Ranma devoured his food as if he'd been living on a deserted  island the past year. Ranma halted momentarily,  seeing Misato's odd stare at him. ]<p>Ranma: What?<p>Misato: Um, wow, you really were hungry weren't you?<p>Ranma: Oh, er, sorry, bad habit.<p>Misato: It's okay. You have some rice on your face.<p>Ranma: Where? Here?<p>Misato: No, on your cheek. Over there. Left more! (annoyed) Not there you idiot! Here!<p>[  In a spur of the moment impulse, Misato took chopsticks and plucked the  tiny piece of rice that had been sticking to his cheek. She held it up  for moment, looking at it, before a grin crept up onto her face. Taking  the piece of rice, she opened her mouth and slowly placed the rice onto  her tongue. Gradually, she closed her mouth while Ranma gaped with a  beat red face. ]<p>Misato: (grinning innocently) What?<p>Ranma: N-nothing. (to waitress) Ch-check please.<p>Misato: Are you satisfied I'm eating right now Ranma?<p>Ranma: Uh, yeah, I guess. For now anyways.<p>[ The bill came. ]<p>Ranma: I only got twenties. You got a ten?<p>Misato: (blinks) You mean you're not going to pay for me?<p>Ranma: Eh? Why would I do that? I brought you your purse didn't I?<p>Misato: (annoyed) Nevermind...<p>Ranma: Huh, okay... (mumbles, confused) I thought that was only a Nabiki thing.<p>Misato: What? Who's Nabiki? Old girlfriend?<p>Ranma: (thinks) I said that out loud? (shouts) NO! (more quietly) Er, I mean, no. Just a...just someone I used to know.<p>[  Misato raised an eyebrow in suspicion at Ranma's outburst and reaction.  She had a feeling that this Nabiki was more than just an old  acquaintance. They paid and left the restaurant. Ranma walked Misato  back to her workplace. ]<p>Ranma: I'll see ya back at Hinata Inn Misato.<p>Misato: (nods) Okay. (grins suddenly) Bye honey!<p>Ranma: (grimaces) HEY!<p>[  Misato walked off into NERV before Ranma could say anything else, much  to his chagrin. Ranma muttered to himself and roof hopped back to  Hinata Inn. ]<p>= = = = = = = = =<p>A/N: Sorry for the delay.  This was actually the most difficult chapter I've had to write so far.  I had half of it done a while ago but somewhere in the middle, I got  stuck and didn't know where to go with it.</p>
