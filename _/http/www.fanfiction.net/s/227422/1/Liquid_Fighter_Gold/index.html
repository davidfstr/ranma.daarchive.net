</div>Ranma 1/2<p>Liquid Fighter Gold!<p>Prologue...<p>+++++++++++<p>Liquid fighters, the newest sport to take the world by storm.<br/>Created by German scientist Ludwig Von Krugen in 1965, it involves<br/>using special units, that when attached to the nervous system of a<br/>human, give that person the ability to control the Liquid Units. The<br/>Unit itself is a semi-solid holographic image; they can in any situation<br/>at any time do tasks that are impossible for a human being to match, thus<br/>their usefulness in both industry and entertainment.<p>These super powered units can do no real damage to property and<br/>cannot harm human beings in any way because of their semi-solid form<br/>and incredibly complex behavioral programming that prevents them from<br/>harming any living thing. However their versatility is not discounted<br/>as various models are created for labor work and public service. The<br/>result being their popular use in street fights and betting matches.<p>Unfortunately the superior units, known as liquid fighters, also<br/>take a tremendous will and total concentration to manipulate beyond<br/>very basic functions. People like this are rare, and the units<br/>themselves are expensive, keeping only a select few individuals who can<br/>own one. These fighters often never reach near the potential of the<br/>units, but on the very rare occasion that it does happen, the<br/>controller may attempt to prove his or her worth by competing in the<br/>ultimate tournament, the 'Liquid Fighter Gold' competition.<p>With a cash prize of more than ten million US dollars, this event<br/>is run by a US company and is held in a specialized mega-dome in Tokyo<br/>each year. Legends are born and fall there as the brutal competitions<br/>test the abilities of the contestants to the limit.<p>The year is 1982, now another legend is about to be born...<p>Ranma Saotome sat waiting for his father to return; he had gone<br/>into a nearby town and left him sitting here on a rock, alone.<p>"How long is he gonna take?" muttered the boy lazily as he licked<br/>his fingers clean of the Okonomiyaki sauce. He snorted to himself as<br/>he laid back, staring at the sky through the treetops that lined the<br/>side of the path. "I wish Ucchan didn't have to leave so soon."<p>++++++++++++<p>Genma Saotome walked lazily from a ramen booth patting his<br/>stomach. "I would have brought the boy with me, but he has to learn<br/>the hardships of the road if he wants to be a true martial artist."<p>The explanation was enough to quiet his conscience as he strolled<br/>back towards the path out of town with a single apple in his hand for<br/>his son. He had more money to buy food with if need be, but it was<br/>unnecessary to tell the boy about it.<p>He passed by a small pawnshop and stared into the<br/>window for a moment as something caught his attention. "Is that what I<br/>think it is?" he wondered out loud.<p>The proprietor of the store stopped sweeping and smiled to<br/>himself. "Yeah, it's a liquid unit, combat model too. Unfortunately<br/>it's useless without the machine to put it inside of the body. I'm<br/>sorry I bought the damn thing. Who would be fool enough to put it in<br/>manually? You'd have to slice someone's back open and risk paralyzing<br/>them. No self-respecting company will install one that they didn't<br/>sell you either. It's just a worthless hunk of junk." He eyed Genma<br/>carefully and smiled to himself as the man turned to face him.<p>"Maybe I can take it off your hands?"<p>++++++++++++++<p>Genma whistled to himself as he strolled along the path towards<br/>his son, in his hands was a bottle of sake, and on his back was a<br/>leather bag with the unit inside. "Tonight Ranma, you drink well!"<br/>laughed the man cheerfully as he grinned to himself. Surely, if a<br/>machine could do it, he would not have any problem installing the<br/>unit.<p>++++++++++++<p>The next morning... Ranma Saotome lay in tears as his body refused<br/>to move, he had been this way since he had woken up. All he remembered<br/>was his father gave him some strange tasting drink that burned his<br/>throat, and practically forced it down his throat.<p>After about an hour he had passed out, when he woke up, his entire<br/>body was on fire and his head felt like it was about to explode. He<br/>looked up lazily and realized he was moving, glancing down at his feet<br/>he saw that Genma had created a stretcher of sorts and was dragging<br/>him along behind him.<p>"Pop?" whimpered the boy pathetically.<p>"Oh, so you're awake son?" said the man merrily.<p>"Ow, don't talk Pop, my back..." whispered the boy.<p>Genma roared with laughter that sent waves of aching pain into the<br/>boy's head. "Don't worry about it son! It's just a hang over, it'll<br/>feel better in a few days!"<p>Ranma's eyes went wide as he, unwisely, shouted out in alarm.<br/>"DAYS?"<p>"That's right son, take it like a man!" said the elder Saotome<br/>with a dark look in his eyes. Genma cheerfully continued on his way<br/>dragging the boy behind him.<p>In truth it would probably be another month before he could start<br/>to train him again, but now they had a way to fund the training trip.<br/>With Ranma possessing a real Liquid Fighter, they could easily make<br/>enough money to travel around with. Once he got the boy trained with<br/>it, but that couldn't take very long; besides, his son was sure to<br/>have the mental abilities to control such a unit, he was a Saotome<br/>after all.<p>"Pop, who's that following us?" said the boy groggily.<p>Genma froze and slowly turned around, "I hope it's not that Kuonji<br/>kid again," he thought, the man had been pressing on him to engage<br/>Ranma and the girl together. He didn't see any real incentive to do so<br/>with the Tendo Dojo in his future, so he had taken the man's gift, and<br/>simply left her behind. He blinked when he saw the girl, and frowned.<br/>It was not Kuonji.<p>Standing behind them was a young red haired girl of about ten<br/>years old. She stared blankly at them and stopped. "Who are you? Are<br/>you lost?" said Genma gently.<p>The girl blinked and stared at him. "What is your designation?"<p>"What?" asked the man in confusion. The girl stared at him in an,<br/>unnerving, emotionless daze.<p>"What is your designation?" repeated the strange girl calmly.<p>Genma stepped back and turned around with a shrug continuing<br/>onward with the boy in tow.<p>The girl continued to follow them silently. Genma frowned as she<br/>suddenly sped up her pace and walked along beside Ranma staying no<br/>more than a few feet away from him.<p>The boy looked bewildered, but was not very upset by her presence.<p>Finally, despite the pain involved, Ranma spoke to her. "Who are<br/>you? Why are you followin us?"<p>"Designation, Combat Unit 000371, you are designated operator,"<br/>replied the girl in a soft emotionless voice.<p>Genma froze and slowly turned to look at her. "You're the Liquid<br/>Unit?"<p>"Yes," replied the girl.<p>The older man frowned slightly at the sight of the girl. "I<br/>remember now, you have to develop the unit! Train it!" he mentally<br/>slapped himself and frowned at her. In time she would grow a<br/>personality based off of her son's emotional pattern.<p>Suddenly, an idea formed in the back of his mind. "Oh, I remember<br/>now! Son, this girl is uhh...Ranko! She'll be your sparing partner!"<p>The boy blinked and tried his best to pay attention despite the<br/>pain in his back and head.<p>"He is suffering from the insertion of the unit more than normal,<br/>perhaps anesthetic should be administered," said the girl looking up<br/>at Genma expectantly.<p>"We don't have any," replied the man with a frown. "My son can<br/>take the pain, it's training."<p>"I do not understand," replied the girl simply. She did not push<br/>the matter any further though, and continued to stroll along beside<br/>them.<p>"So, you're Ranko huh?" said the boy weakly offering his new<br/>friend a smile.<p>"Is that this unit's designation?" said the girl calmly. It didn't<br/>really sound much like a question.<p>"What a weirdo," muttered Ranma as he closed his eyes and tried to<br/>go back to sleep while he could.<p>+++++++++++++++<p>A few months passed in the blink of an eye. Ranma Saotome jumped<br/>into the air and was struck square in the chest as the girl performed<br/>a complicated air punch that slammed into his chest. He felt a slight<br/>pushing against his chest and frowned as he returned the blow with a<br/>full force strike to the girl's head.<p>"That is another point for me," said the girl mechanically.<p>Genma noticed a small smile on her lips, she started doing that<br/>after about a week of operation. The boy took some convincing in order<br/>to get him to train with her, he didn't realize that she wasn't real<br/>at first and still had some doubts. He thought back to the day for a<br/>moment and frowned to himself.<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Pop, how come I gotta fight this girl?" snapped the boy a little<br/>bitterly.<p>"Son, you know she isn't a girl, she isn't even real!" the man<br/>scratched his head and sighed. "Besides, if you lose it's your own<br/>fault, you're the one making her beat you."<p>The boy blinked and looked at the girl silently for a moment. He<br/>knew every move she was going to make and yet somehow it still got<br/>through to him. The old man smiled to himself as he realized it was a<br/>wonderful idea to allow Ranma to train with the unit. He still sparred<br/>with the boy on his own of course, but this way Ranma didn't have to<br/>pull his punches no matter how good he got. The unit was easily his<br/>son's better at the moment and probably would always be that way. It<br/>still gave him a sense of pride that the boy could even keep up with<br/>the base unit functions. He had heard that it was impossible to do so<br/>for just a normal human.<p>"Get back to work boy! Don't be lazy!" snapped the man as he<br/>realized his son had stopped training in order to inspect his partner<br/>out of curiosity. Genma had turned around, only to see his son putting<br/>his hand through the girl's chest and laughing to himself.<p>"It feel's weird pop!" he cried cheerfully before jumping back and<br/>taking up a combat stance.<p>"Are you prepared?" asked the girl.<p>"Anytime!" retorted the boy as he rushed forward.<p>++++++++++++<p>A few days later, Genma Saotome stood directly across from the<br/>group of construction workers holding Ranma by the shoulder. The small<br/>red haired girl waited patiently nearby in clothes exactly like the<br/>boy's with a blank expression on her face. One of the larger men<br/>stepped forward and smiled at the boy slamming a wad of money on the<br/>table.<p>"This kid? You're on old man!" A hulking man appeared behind him<br/>dressed in a bright orange vest with a gaze that matched Ranma's unit<br/>easily. He was probably around eight feet tall and appeared to be made<br/>of nothing but muscle. The two older men realized that he wasn't<br/>really made from anything at all, but the boy gaped at him in shock.<p>"Pop! Ranko can't beat him! He's huge!" said the boy as he pulled<br/>at the bottom of his dogi.<p>Genma frowned and leaned next to the boy. "Ranma, Ranko can't be<br/>hurt! She's not real. Now come on boy, she's just as strong as he is,<br/>he just looks that way because he's a construction unit!"<p>Ranma got a determined look on his face as he turned back towards<br/>Ranko, "You can do it!"<p>She looked at him blankly for a moment. "This unit is superior in<br/>strength and stamina, our speed is the only way to win."<p>Ranma blinked and pat her on the back. "Right, how about we just<br/>hit him?"<p>"That is acceptable," replied the girl simply. A moment later the<br/>two units stood facing each other in the center of the construction<br/>lot. Two round golden bars appeared in the air over the boy and the<br/>construction worker's head. The older man sat cross-legged deep in<br/>concentration as his unit put its fists up.<p>Ranma looked at him blankly and frowned. "What's he doing pop?"<p>"I don't know boy," replied Genma with a shrug. The man started to<br/>get a strained look on his face as the battle began, while Ranma,<br/>merely stood in a relaxed position and watched.<p>++++++++++++++++++<p>Ranko jumped aside as the much larger unit's fist slammed into the<br/>ground creating a dust cloud. She pulled back and kicked him in the<br/>face knocking a small amount of yellow away on the construction<br/>worker's bar. It was replaced by a red portion of bar of the same<br/>color. This continued for several moments while Ranko jumped around<br/>dodging the construction unit's blows easily as it attempted to box<br/>her. Her face was calm throughout the battle even after the unit<br/>picked up a board to use as a weapon. Raising her arm she blocked a<br/>strike from the unit's weapon and Ranma looked up to see a tiny<br/>portion of his own bar was gone.<p>However, since the construction worker had picked up the board the<br/>operator's face had grown red as he strained for some strange reason.<br/>The boy jumped up and cheered as his unit punched the larger one in<br/>the gut knocking off another small portion of it's energy leaving it<br/>with a small amount.<p>Suddenly, the construction unit lashed out with a powerful blow<br/>that sent Ranko flying across the construction yard.<p>Ranma looked up in shock as almost half of his energy bar vanished<br/>in an instant. "What? No way!" he growled and stared the man down<br/>noticing a smirk on his face despite the amount of strain he was<br/>putting out. Ranma felt a strange rage boil up inside of him and Ranko<br/>shot back across the lot like a bullet. She sailed over the counter<br/>strike into a kick that slammed into the hulking construction unit's<br/>face sending it to the ground on it's back.<p>In what appeared like a wave of energy the unit vanished from the<br/>field, and appeared behind the construction worker as he let out a<br/>breath and almost fell over in exhaustion.<p>The boy walked over to Ranko and smiled at her. "How come you lost<br/>so much energy? That's not fair!"<p>"I must build stamina, speed, strength, and skill. That is the way<br/>these games are played," she looked over at the other unit and said<br/>nothing more.<p>"He doesn't even look hurt!" said Ranma in annoyance.<p>Ranko replied again. "Units cannot be damaged, clothing and battle<br/>damage is only used for show; to make matches more interesting. Once<br/>the battle is over all systems are returned to normal."<p>"Oh, that's good I guess," said the boy simply.<p>He walked over to where his father was standing with the men. The<br/>were arguing with him angrily.<p>"I'm telling you man, there's no way that kid was controlling that<br/>unit! He didn't even break a sweat! This is some kind of scam!" cried<br/>one of the man's fellow workers bitterly.<p>"Are you implying that my boy..." started Genma as he lifted the<br/>man by his shirt.<p>"You're damn right!" snapped the man fearlessly.<p>"Shut up!" snapped the tired looking man who had faced Ranma.<br/>"I've seen this before."<p>Everyone became deathly silent. "This boy isn't cheating, he's<br/>gifted. I wouldn't be surprised if I saw him in the Liquid Gold a few<br/>years from now."<p>"What do you mean?" asked Genma as he dropped the man in his grasp and simply stared dumbly.<p>"Your son can control the unit without much effort, I've heard of<br/>protege's like him before. Supposedly there's even a boy in China who<br/>can control his well enough to spar with it. You've got quite a<br/>fighter there, and with a combat unit to boot. Old man, you have no<br/>idea what you've just stumbled onto do you?" the man smiled and faced<br/>Ranma, who didn't quite understand what the big deal was.<p>"Good enough to spar with his own unit you say?" Genma looked over<br/>at Ranma and saw yen signs hanging around the boy's head.<p>"No freaking way! That's just some stupid tabloid story!" snapped<br/>one of the other workers as he walked away in disgust.<p>The man handed Genma his money and turned on the men around him.<br/>"Get back to work! Break's over!"<p>++++++++++<p>Liquid Fighter Gold!<p>Part 1<p>Yet again, Here's Ranma!<p>++++++++++++<p>The open expanse of the ring stood before Ranko as she eyed her<br/>opponent carefully; Her body had grown over the past few years, she<br/>now had the look of a girl in her mid-teens, a poor testament too her<br/>skills.<p>The other fighter looked weary and beaten on, his energy bar<br/>showed more than half gone, with a nervous looking and heavily<br/>sweating trainer seated in the corner as he tried his hardest to<br/>concentrate.<p>Her opponent was a muscular fighter-class unit, dressed in a white<br/>dogi with long brown hair that cascaded around his face. He smirked<br/>with an almost disgusting looking grin and charged forward reaching<br/>for her.<p>With a carefully calculated speed she rushed forward slamming her<br/>fist into his gut causing a massive loss of energy on the unit's<br/>energy bar. He bent forward in reaction to the blow and returned her<br/>strike with a spin kick aimed at her forehead. She ducked easily and<br/>reversed the move sending her own leg immediately following his own;<br/>she connected with his forehead sending him down on the mat. Within<br/>seconds the man vanished in a ripple of space and appeared behind the<br/>squatty looking bald man in the opposite corner.<p>Ranma jumped about excitedly as he celebrated her victory in the<br/>corner. To those watching it seemed as if he were merely a spectator<br/>at the sidelines. He had been energetic and had hardly sat still<br/>throughout the entire five-minute match.<p>"And the winner, controlled by Ranma Saotome! Ranko!" cried the<br/>announcer as he walked fearlessly into the center of the ring and<br/>pushed a small button that seemed to zap her out of the ring and next<br/>to Ranma.<p>A wave of cheers erupted through the crowd as they went wild in<br/>the stands.<p>"Did you see that Pop?" Next to the boy a large panda sipped at<br/>its drink lazily as it watched, it looked completely ridiculous as it<br/>sat there wearing a gold ring on it's claw with a small expensive<br/>looking watch on it's arm. The animal showed its teeth in an attempt<br/>to smile and nodded at its son lazily, with several gold teeth<br/>sparkling in its grin. It flapped an arm lazily waving the sleeves of<br/>its expensive looking Kimono around slightly.<p>Ranma pat the girl on her back cheerfully. "That was great! We're<br/>in the tournament for sure this year!"<p>He was sixteen years old now and had grown quite handsomely. His<br/>hair was tied in a loose ponytail behind his back and he had a strange<br/>confident gleam to his eyes.<p>"Yeah! Just you wait!" replied the girl with a confident look that<br/>matched the boy's almost exactly.<p>"Say old man, what are we doing now?" She turned to look at the<br/>panda expectantly.<p>It pulled a sign out from behind it and gave another attempted<br/>grin. "We've got a meeting son."<p>"You handle it pop, I don't need to be there. I was gonna go spar<br/>with Ranko some, I don't get much exercise at these things," replied<br/>the boy as he turned away. He looked around as the crowd settled in<br/>for the main event fight.<p>It felt good to be back in Japan again, despite everything that<br/>had happened to him in China he still felt good being on his native<br/>soil. He rarely stayed in the arena to watch the matches after his<br/>own. Glancing up as the professional fighters entered the ring he<br/>smiled, the units in the ring now would completely destroy Ranko as<br/>she was now with a single blow. Still determination burned in his<br/>eyes.<p>"Someday, that'll be us up there Ran-chan."<p>"You bet!" replied the girl flexing her arm. The younger Saotome<br/>was hit in the back of his head by a sign.<p>"You have to be there this time dolt!" The boy looked at his<br/>father and blinked.<p>"What are you talkin about pop? You always handle this stuff, why<br/>do I need to go?"<p>"It's not that kind of meeting!" said the panda's sign.<p>"What kind of meeting is it?" asked Ranko in confusion.<p>Genma simply stared at them for a moment. "You have to be there,"<br/>said the sign he put up after trying his best to come up with another<br/>response.<p>"So when do we go?" asked the girl with a deadpan look in her<br/>eyes. Ranma could tell that he was up to something, consequently, she<br/>was suspicious as well.<p>"Right after we get paid of course!" replied the animal.<p>"I don't like this," snorted Ranma with a skeptical look appearing<br/>in his face for a moment.<p>"You don't have to like it you just have to come!" retorted the<br/>panda with yet another sign as it smacked the boy over his head with<br/>it. It stuffed a fat looking wallet into its kimono and shoved the boy<br/>forward as they stepped out of the small auditorium.<p>"Ow! Okay, okay! Jeez!" replied the boy as he allowed himself to<br/>be pushed out into the rain. Ranma turned towards her father and<br/>frowned. "Good thinking genius!"<p>"We'll take a cab!" replied the panda.<p>"Who's gonna stop for a panda idiot!" retorted Ranma angrily as<br/>her father stood by the side of the road waving his arm in the air.<p>A cab pulled up next to him and the animal opened the door while<br/>looking at his son. "See?"<p>Ranko seemed to ripple for a moment as she vanished from Ranma's<br/>side into thin air. "You stop for pandas?" asked Ranma after tapping<br/>the man on the shoulder.<p>"Hey babe, I stop for anyone wearin a Rolex," he stepped on the<br/>gas and Ranma merely slumped down in her seat.<p>"Are you going to tell me what's going on now?" asked Ranma<br/>impatiently.<p>Genma gave his best panda smile again and held up another sign.<br/>"Well you see, I made this promise..."<p>In the center of the street several motorist and pedestrians<br/>stopped and stared as a scream erupted from the cab. "WHAT!"<p>The vehicle started to shake violently back and forth suddenly.<br/>The cabby inside merely looked back lazily and turned up the already<br/>obnoxiously loud stereo to drown out the cries of pain. "It's almost<br/>like having hydraulics," he snorted lazily to himself.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Akane Tendo jogged towards her home dressed in shorts and a tank<br/>top shirt. She had a pleased looking smile on her face as she<br/>approached the gates to the grounds. She gave a heavy sigh as she<br/>rushed into the home ignoring her family in favor of the changing<br/>room. Quickly dressing in her dogi she rushed out into the back yard<br/>to get in some power training. After a moment of setup she punched<br/>down sharply shattering the cinder block she had raised into dust. She<br/>gave a satisfied sigh as she looked at its remains and placed another<br/>one for demolition in its place.<p>"Ah, that was nice."<p>++++++++++++<p>Meanwhile...<p>Ranma dove from the window of the taxi rolling across the wet<br/>pavement and finally pushing herself up into a defensive stance. She<br/>saw her father emerging from the car while handing a small wad of cash<br/>to the driver.<p>In his paw was a sign that said, "This will be fine."<p>"No way am I gonna let you do this to me!" snapped Ranma and Ranko<br/>in unison as she appeared beside her master.<p>Genma stepped back and growled getting into his own stance. The<br/>pair charged each other slamming into each other's bodies' in a flurry<br/>of punches and kicks.<p>Ranma was outclassed and skittered to a stop on her feet after<br/>being thrown back several feet. He growled and turned away dashing<br/>into the crowd in hopes of a better battleground.<p>Genma followed easily keeping up with the boy while Ranko lazily<br/>followed a few feet behind him.<p>They stopped in a deserted looking street corner and faced off<br/>again, this time Ranma had the clear advantage as she rushed her<br/>father.<p>Genma was clearly more powerful, but Ranma dodged and weaved<br/>between his blows, the girl jumped back after no opening presented<br/>itself. Genma took the initiative and rushed forward with a punch<br/>combination.<p>"Where do you get off old man?" snapped his son angrily as she<br/>caught the arm and used the momentum to throw the large animal over<br/>her shoulder. "Picking my fiancee for me, without even asking!"<p>Genma watched her sail over his head and retrieve her bag as he<br/>lay there and snickered to himself.<p>"I'm going back to China! Suck on that old man!" snapped the girl<br/>angrily. Genma sat up and pulled a street sign from the side of the<br/>road and promptly swung it at his son. The animal froze when the pole<br/>swung right through the girl's pack and into her head. She turned and<br/>smirked at him as the real Ranma slammed into his head from behind<br/>with an angry scream sending the animal to the pavement. "I'm gonna<br/>find a cure for this stupid curse and then win the Liquid Gold<br/>competition! I don't have time for girls!" she snapped as she turned<br/>away.<p>Genma was not quite out yet though and quickly returned the strike<br/>with his sign, this time striking the correct target.<p>Ranma was knocked out cold and Ranko seemed to freeze suddenly<br/>before flashing out of existence. Genma snorted and lifted up the two<br/>bags before continuing on with his son over his shoulder. "The boy is<br/>getting smarter, that was unexpected," thought the animal angrily as<br/>it chided itself for being so easily fooled.<p>Ranko did not look like Ranma did initially; there was a slight<br/>resemblance before, but nothing like after Jusenkyo. Ever since the<br/>boy climbed out of the pool she had looked exactly like him when he<br/>was cursed. He wasn't sure if it was an effect of the pool either<br/>since she didn't look like her old self when he was male.<p>A few moments later Ranma woke up and started to struggle, Ranko<br/>appeared again next to her and simply walked silently for a ways<br/>watching the scene quietly.<p>After a short time they walked up to a house with a large wooden<br/>gate in front of it. Genma walked through the structure and headed<br/>towards the house. He stopped outside of the home and put Ranma on her<br/>feet before dropping his traveling bag on the ground. The boy stood<br/>silently glaring at the front door of the home angrily while the panda<br/>went through his belongings.<p>After a moment of rummaging around in his things, Genma came up<br/>with a small thermos and chuckled to himself. There was a small green<br/>light on the side of it and Genma poured some of the contents on his<br/>son returning him to his male form.<p>"Ow! Idiot! That's for making hot tea remember?"<p>Genma was staring at his son with a look of pain on his face as he<br/>danced around in an attempt to cool off his arms and head. "Why didn't<br/>you say so sooner boy?" snapped the man angrily.<p>"Where the hell are we?" snorted Ranma angrily as Ranko walked up<br/>next to him keeping quiet about the whole affair.<p>"Put her away boy! We're going to see an old friend of mine and<br/>you're going to marry his daughter and like it!" snapped the man.<p>"I don't got no time for no stupid girls!" snapped Ranma in retort<br/>as Ranko vanished again.<p>Genma opened the door and something creaked over their heads, both<br/>men looked up as a leak formed on the porch just over their heads<br/>spraying the both of them with a small trickle of water. It wasn't<br/>much, but it was just enough. "Growf," cursed Genma angrily as a young<br/>girl looked at them expectantly.<p>"Hello, can I help you?" she asked in a sweet voice.<p>"Is this the Tendo residence?" said the panda with a sign.<p>"Oh my," replied Kasumi as her sister and her father rushed up<br/>behind her with expectant looks on their faces.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma looked down at the man resting across the floor and sighed<br/>heavily.<p>"This is all your fault daddy!" snapped the middle daughter<br/>angrily.<p>"Well I assumed my friend Genma's son was a boy!" retorted the man<br/>from his place on the floor.<p>"Does this look like a boy to you?" cried the girl as she grabbed<br/>Ranma's chest.<p>Ranma was about to stand up and walk out of the home, she had been<br/>fondled and accosted one to many times by this family and she was<br/>getting tired of it fast. "Stupid old man, they must be some kind of<br/>perverts or somethin; that must be why the old fart like them so<br/>much."<p>"Nabiki! He...she is a guest!" snapped the youngest girl angrily.<br/>She turned towards Ranma and smiled, "My name is Akane, you want to be<br/>friends?"<p>Ranma found herself nodding and decided that it might not be such<br/>a bad idea to stick around after all.<p>++++++++++<p>"This is the dojo," said Akane as they entered the training hall.<br/>"So you study kenpo?"<p>Ranma stopped looking around and nodded sheepishly. "A little."<p>"So let's have a little match then!" cried Akane excitedly. Ranma<br/>could see she was pleased by this revelation. "Don't worry I won't<br/>hurt you."<p>"O...ok," replied the girl shyly. She still was unsure about her<br/>situation.<p>What followed was easily a joke on Ranma's part. Akane started her<br/>attack expecting someone who was good, but still below her own level.<br/>Ranma smiled inwardly as she realized this and dodged with a little<br/>more flash and seeming effortlessness each time she punched.<p>Finally Akane reached the end of her frustrations and charged<br/>forward angrily. "This time for real!" she slammed her fist into the<br/>wall creating a hole there easily.<p>Ranma landed behind her and touched the base of her neck lightly<br/>signaling that she had won the match. The girl was foolish, finesse<br/>always beat out brute strength, but she still seemed nice enough so<br/>far.<p>"Wow, you're pretty good!" exclaimed Akane as she smiled with a<br/>hint of embarrassment in her face.<p>"Yeah," replied the redhead shyly.<p>"I'm just glad you're not a boy," said the Akane as she turned<br/>away.<p>Ranma sucked in a quick breath and stared at her in shock. "Huh?"<p>"It's just that, I'd really hate to lose to a boy."<p>Ranma clenched her jaw slightly as a sudden fear took hold of her.<br/>"What the heck did she mean by that?"<p>Kasumi entered the room and stopped the conversation abruptly, as<br/>she showed Ranma to the room she'd be staying in.<p>The pigtailed girl placed her bag on the ground and looked at the<br/>barren room silently.<p>"Would you like to take a bath now Ranma?" asked the girl sweetly.<p>"Um, no thanks," she said quickly.<p>"You've been exercising haven't you?" chided the girl calmly.<p>"Uhh, yeah," replied Ranma as she realized she was trapped.<p>++++++++++++<p>Once inside the furo Ranma dumped water over her head to rinse<br/>away the soap while Ranko finished scrubbing her back lazily.<p>"Thanks."<p>"No problem," replied the girl as she stood up and lowered herself<br/>into the hot water with her.<p>Ranma looked at her and sighed. "What am I gonna do now?" he sat<br/>back against the tiles and stared at the ceiling.<p>"You're asking me? You're the one in charge remember?" he frowned<br/>slightly at her comment and looked at her.<p>"Come on at least try," he said impatiently.<p>"Ranma, you can't ask me what I think; mostly because you already<br/>know what I think remember?" the girl winked at him and looked down<br/>into the water. "Hey, I can take care of that if you want...it's in my<br/>programming you know," she said calmly.<p>"No! How many times to I have to tell you I don't need your help<br/>with that?" snapped the boy in embarrassment.<p>"I'm also programmed to offer if it happens while we are alone,"<br/>replied the girl with a shrug. "Thinking about that girl out there?"<p>"You shut up! What kind of pervert programmed you?" snapped the<br/>boy bitterly.<p>"It's standard on all female models, especially the more expensive<br/>ones like a fighter-unit," she turned away and looked at the doorway<br/>for a moment. "I was designed to cater to rich males, like you've<br/>become by the way."<p>"Thanks to you, I miss not having money sometimes," replied Ranma<br/>wistfully. He put his head further into the water and moved around a<br/>bit. "What to do though? Should I go out like I am?"<p>"Don't ask me," replied Ranko lazily.<p>"I might as well go out like I am," said Ranma as he stood up.<p>Suddenly, the door opened and there she was standing there staring<br/>at him. He froze in shock and stared at her for a moment with Ranko<br/>getting the exact same expression on her face.<p>"Sorry to intrude," gasped Akane with a deep blush appearing on<br/>her face. She stepped back out of the room and put on her dogi. "Who<br/>was that?" her mind screamed. She thought back and noticed Ranma was<br/>in there with him, "It's none of my business, but honestly in someone<br/>else's house no less!" the blush returned a new and Nabiki looked up<br/>in surprise.<p>"I thought you where going to take a bath," asked the older girl<br/>as she noticed the blush on her sister's face.<p>"Ranma's in there with some guy," replied the girl simply without<br/>stopping as she walked to the other side of the table and poured<br/>herself a cup of tea.<p>"What does that matter you're both gir...what?" Nabiki realized<br/>exactly what her sister had said and froze.<p>Kasumi blushed and put her hand up to her face and blushed deeply.<br/>"Oh, my." They all turned to see a boy dressed in Chinese clothes<br/>looking at the floor in embarrassment as he walked into the room.<p>"Uhh," Akane quickly turned away trying desperately to remove the<br/>mental image from her mind.<p>"Who are you?" asked Nabiki.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome...sorry about this."<p>+++++++++++<p>Liquid Unit Profile: Construction Unit Omnicom Designation:<br/>Un15377 Class: C-2 general use model, variant 27 Description and<br/>General info: Used in the construction industry these units are used<br/>by foremen and workers to perform light menial tasks. While large and<br/>slow they are usually used to operate machinery, perform light tasks,<br/>and mix/heat construction materials for use by the human workers.<p>As with all Units their semi solid form prevents them from doing<br/>any heavy lifting. They can however use hand tools and go places a<br/>normal human being cannot. One unique ability that the worker-class<br/>Units have is the ability to change their relative size to suit the<br/>situation. A six-foot tall worker can easily become a four-foot tall<br/>worker to more easily move in a cramped environment. Because of the<br/>expense of the Unit most workers who wear them are foremen or<br/>extremely trusted employees.<p>This has caused numerous problems for some companies in the past,<br/>as on occasion the employee would quit soon after the unit was<br/>implanted. This problem was solved when construction companies started<br/>using long-term contracts with all employees using the liquid units.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Liquid Fighter Gold<p>Part 2<p>Ranma's secret.<p>+++++++++++++<p>The girls sat around at the table staring at the newcomer, Ranko<br/>sat beside him looking just as embarrassed as he was.<p>Genma smiled as he realized everyone was present and started his<br/>speech.<p>Nabiki was staring at the boy with the suspicion that she knew him<br/>from somewhere and could not quite place her finger on it.<p>"I am Genma Saotome, and this is my son..." he stopped to allow<br/>the boy to introduce himself.<p>"Ranma," finished the boy.<p>"If you're Ranma, then who is this girl?" said Nabiki as she<br/>indicated the red head.<p>"Huh? Oh that's just Ranko," replied the boy.<p>"I could have sworn she called herself Ranma Saotome, what a<br/>relief," said Soun with a laugh. "You never told me you had a daughter<br/>Saotome."<p>"I don't," replied the man simply.<p>The Tendos looked at the pair in confusion, but remained silent.<br/>Soun finally spoke up, "So tell me Saotome, have you been well?"<p>Genma looked at the man and laughed. "I'm fine Tendo, the girl is<br/>Ranko, my son's liquid fighter unit."<p>A sudden understanding seemed to come over the girls as they<br/>looked at the girl. Nabiki definitely had an interest in the pair now,<br/>she could make a lot of money off of this if she played it right.<p>"I knew it, he's a pervert!" snorted Akane in disgust.<p>Ranma turned towards her with a look that told her he didn't quite<br/>understand what she was talking about.<p>"Just what do you think you where doing in our bathroom with that<br/>thing huh? I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that here!" snarled<br/>the girl as she turned away from him.<p>"What the hell are you talkin..." the boy was cut off as Genma<br/>smacked him on the back of the head.<p>"Watch your mouth boy! We're guests here!" chided the elder<br/>Saotome.<p>"Ouch! You stupid old man! She was callin me a pervert for no good<br/>reason!" screamed the boy in retort as he threw his father into the<br/>air and smiled as he landed in the small Koi pond in the back yard.<p>"No good reason?" snapped Akane angrily, she stopped cold when a<br/>large panda emerged from the water and growled at the boy angrily.<p>Ranma charged forward, attacking the animal full force. "We have<br/>to tell them boy!" said the animal with a large sign.<p>"They don't gotta know nothin!" retorted Ranma as he kicked the<br/>beast back.<p>Genma snorted and gave the boy a low sweep that was narrowly<br/>dodged. Ranma flipped back and landed on his feet a few yards away.<p>Soun stood up and looked at the scene in shock. "Saotome?"<p>Genma stopped and turned around sheepishly as he held a sign up.<br/>"Hello Tendo."<p>"What don't we need to know about?" asked Nabiki warily.<p>"Nothin," replied Ranma simply as he sat down at the table while<br/>Genma produced the electric thermos again pouring its contents over<br/>his head.<p>"If that's the way you want it boy, I'll have no part in it,"<br/>snorted the man as he changed back.<p>"Stupid old man," grumbled Ranma as he sat down and crossed his<br/>arms showing disinterest in the whole affair.<p>Nabiki had a revelation and stared at the boy in shock. "I know<br/>him!"<p>Akane looked at her and frowned before dismissing the matter.<p>Soun looked at Genma as the man started his story. "It all started<br/>in China a fateful two months ago..." Genma finished his tale giving<br/>all the particulars of Jusenkyo and how he became a panda. Cutting off<br/>just short of his son falling into the spring of drowned girl after<br/>the boy gave him a warning glare that no one else seemed to notice.<p>"Ah, that explains it," said the Tendo patriarch as he moved<br/>beside Ranma and grabbed him by the shoulder. "These are my daughters,<br/>Kasumi nineteen, Nabiki eighteen, and my youngest daughter Akane,<br/>she's sixteen! Pick anyone you like and she'll be your new fiancee."<p>Ranma turned to stare at him in disbelief and was about to protest<br/>when Kasumi spoke up. "Oh, he want's Akane."<p>"What? Why would I?" started the girl in protest.<p>"No! I'll take him!" cried Nabiki as she felt her opportunity<br/>falling through her fingers.<p>Everyone in the room stared at her in shock. "Are you sure<br/>Nabiki?" asked her elder sister.<p>"Positive," replied the girl as she eyed the expensive clothing<br/>Ranma's father was wearing.<p>"Hey! I ain't got time for no girls!" snapped the boy angrily as<br/>he started for the door. "The Liquid Gold Tournament is only a year<br/>away and I got some training to do, I'm going back to China!" He<br/>started for the door and was stopped by his father's arm.<p>"Have you forgotten what's waiting for you in China boy? Are you<br/>out of your mind?" he snapped bitterly.<p>"If I can last this long I think I can go another year without any<br/>problem, she was an idiot anyway," retorted the boy as he pushed past<br/>him.<p>Akane almost seemed relieved as the boy walked towards the door.<br/>"I don't need to be around no stupid peeping tomboys anyway,"<br/>commented the boy as he walked just within her reach. Almost as a<br/>reflex she found herself crushing him under the weight of the table.<p>"Now that he had coming," replied Genma sagely. No one even<br/>noticed Ranko blink out of existence as her master was knocked out<br/>cold.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma woke up with Kasumi and Nabiki kneeling over him, "Don't<br/>mind Akane, she's really a very sweet girl; it's just that she's a<br/>violent maniac," said the elder girl to the boy.<p>"I noticed," replied the boy as he sat up, Ranko appeared beside<br/>the two girls with a neutral expression on her face.<p>"Oh good Kasumi, that makes a lot of sense," said Nabiki as she<br/>put a towel across his head; she turned her attention towards Ranma<br/>and smiled. "How are you feeling fiancee?"<p>"Don't call me that!" he replied curtly before laying back down.<br/>"I feel like someone hit me over the head with a table."<p>"You'll get over it," said the girl with a knowing smile. Behind<br/>her back was a sports magazine, a local rag that had Ranma on the<br/>cover, his picture was inside a small box on the corner of the page.<br/>If the article on him was even remotely close to the truth he'd be on<br/>the covers of magazines across the world someday. "So tell me Saotome,<br/>how advanced is this thing anyway?" asked Nabiki as she looked the red<br/>head up and down. Ranma sat up and looked at her quizzically, it was<br/>not an unusual question; but hardly one he was expecting given his<br/>current situation.<p>"She's a lower mid-level power unit right now, but her skills are<br/>far above any other know unit of her experience and age."<p>Nabiki nodded and pushed him back down on the floor. "Lay down,<br/>you need your rest."<br/>Ranma didn't like what was going on around him much, Ranko had a<br/>distressed expression on her face as she watched the situation as<br/>well.<p>"I don't like this Ranma," she whispered. He looked at her and<br/>decided that maybe he could use another nap.<p>Akane sat fuming in the living room as the two men laughed and<br/>recalled old memories nearby. A sudden thought hit her. "That jerk was<br/>testing me! He sent that stupid robot to fight me!" It explained why<br/>she had been reluctant to hit her and also why she had been so hard<br/>pressed to connect any of her attacks. The unit wasn't even human, she<br/>never stood a chance against it. Still a surge of pride welled up<br/>inside of her as she realized she had done well against such an<br/>opponent. "I showed that jerk, he'll know better than to mess with<br/>me!" she exclaimed proudly.<p>Soun and Genma turned to look at her with horrified stares, they<br/>thought she was talking about the earlier incident involving the<br/>table.<p>"Tendo, is she all right?" whispered Genma.<p>"To be honest, I'm not sure Saotome," replied his friend as the<br/>turned away from the girl as she laughed maniacally while flexing her<br/>arm in pride.<p>+++++++++++++<p>The next day Genma called his son down to the living room after<br/>their morning practice, it was held a good distance away from the koi<br/>pond almost in the front yard.<p>Ranma sat in front of his father with a confused look on his face.<br/>"School?"<p>"Yes, we are going to be staying a while," replied the man as<br/>pleasantly as he could.<p>"You'll be going to the same school as Akane and me, I think<br/>you'll like it there," said Nabiki as she poked her head around the<br/>corner and smiled at him. There was something he didn't like about it,<br/>but he kept quiet. "Hurry up and get ready so we can walk to school<br/>together."<p>She almost giggled at him and it ran chills down his spine as she<br/>tried her best to look cute. Not that she failed or anything, it just<br/>looked a little faked to him.<p>"Nabiki, are we going or not?" snapped Akane as she ran down the<br/>stairs and past her sister.<p>"No, you go on ahead, I'm going to take him with me," replied the<br/>girl indicating Ranma. Akane scowled at him and turned away on her<br/>heels in disgust.<p>"Now what did you do?" wondered Ranko from beside her counterpart.<p>"I haven't seen her since last night, you tell me," replied the<br/>boy a little sharply.<p>"I guess we should go get ready then," replied the red haired girl<br/>as she stood and a school uniform appeared on her body. "All done."<p>"You know that I hate you," muttered Ranma as pulled his favorite<br/>shirt off the floor where he had discarded it before the morning<br/>practice. Nabiki blinked at this, and turned away.<p>"That's strange," she muttered to herself as she waited patiently.<p>A few moments later the three of them where strolling towards the<br/>school, Ranma walked along the top of the fence with Ranko walking<br/>cheerfully behind him. Nabiki walked just below them and looked up in<br/>surprise, she noted that Ranko was wearing boxers under her skirt for<br/>some strange reason.<p>The trip was relatively silent, occasionally Nabiki would ask a<br/>question and receive either a nod or a shake from the boy's head. He<br/>seemed strangely reserved and closed to her.<p>When they almost reached the school he stopped and stared in<br/>disbelief. "What's going on?"<p>There appeared to be some sort of battle going on at the school.<br/>"Oh that, don't worry about it, this happens every morning," it was<br/>too late though as Ranma dashed forward for a better view.<p>Nabiki sighed as she rushed forward and tried to keep up with his<br/>pace. The pair came to a stop as Akane was finishing up the last of<br/>her morning attackers.<p>He jumped down beside her and surveyed the damage. "Boy, you sure<br/>are popular."<p>"What's it to you?" snapped the girl as she turned towards a large<br/>tree in the courtyard.<p>"Oh what fools these mortals be, each seeks the honor of your<br/>company in the unlikely event that he defeats you," said a new voice<br/>as Akane caught a rose that seemed to appear out of nowhere.<p>Ranko leaned forward and inspected it curiously. "Hey, what's<br/>this?" she asked.<p>"It's a rose!" snapped the girl in disgust.<p>"I know that, but why?" replied Ranko in annoyance.<p>A seventeen year old boy dressed in a kendo uniform stepped from<br/>behind the tree and smirked, it died down as he noticed the two new<br/>faces beside Akane. Nabiki Tendo stood nearby watching cautiously.<p>"Get back or you'll get hurt," warned Akane with a scowl appearing<br/>on her face as she got into a defensive stance.<p>"I'm not worried," replied Ranma with a shrug.<p>The boy turned his attention towards Ranma. "Tell me, who are you<br/>bore?"<p>Ranma blinked and pointed at himself. "Huh? I'm..." he was cut off<br/>as the kendoist continued his speech.<p>"Ah, but is the custom to give one's own name first! Fine then!<br/>Mine I shall give!" cried the boy in what seemed like over dramatic<br/>anger.<p>"If you want," replied Ranma still uncertain about what to do.<p>"I am the rising new star of the high school fencing world, the<br/>sound of my voice sends fear into the hearts of my peers. They call me<br/>The Blue Thunder of Furinkan High! Tatewaki Kuno, age seventeen." The<br/>statement was punctuated by a crash of lightening from above as Ranma<br/>tried to understand exactly what was happening to him.<p>"Ok, Um, I'm staying at the Tendo Dojo..." he started, but the boy<br/>would hear no more.<p>"Under the same roof as Akane? I will not allow it!" he screamed<br/>as he charged forward raising his bokuten. His heart stopped as the<br/>strange red haired girl rushed in front of his target as he slashed<br/>downward. He sucked in a quick breath and tried to stop the strike as<br/>it cut into her body without any resistance. He froze with a look of<br/>complete terror on his face as the blade remained inside her chest,<br/>taunting him.<p>Ranko smiled and laughed at him. "Fool." Kuno looked up just in<br/>time to see a fist come through her head from behind, that slam into<br/>his face, sending him sprawling across the ground in shock.<p>"A liquid fighter?"<p>Ranma stood over him dusting his hands off with a snort of<br/>disgust, Nabiki Tendo walked up to the boy and kicked Kuno in his<br/>ribs.<p>"You leave my fiancee alone!" she said angrily.<p>"Fiancee?" whispered Kuno as the words sunk in. "You mean, he does<br/>not hound Akane?" The remaining students of Furinkan gasped in shock<br/>as the girl's words struck home.<p>Nabiki looked around and cursed herself, she could have charged<br/>money for that information. She still had a lot of ways to do that yet<br/>today, the most important of which involved the boy lying on the<br/>ground in front of her. "Kuno baby, you are such an idiot," she<br/>grabbed the kendoist by his arm and pulled him into the building.<p>+++++++++++<p>Tatewaki sat up and frowned deeply at the thought of this new<br/>development, he shook off Nabiki's grip and stood up. "No doubt he<br/>seeks to take Akane's heart through her sister. I must put a stop to<br/>this evil plot, such a cowardly defense cannot be forgiven either.<br/>Using a woman's body to shield himself cannot be forgiven, it matters<br/>not if she is real." As he stood up and turned towards the school<br/>building a light shower began to fall from the sky. "Vile knave, we<br/>shall see who is worthy of Akane Tendo's heart!"<p>"That we shall master," said a feminine voice from behind him. It<br/>was emotionless, yet somehow produced a sort of pride.<p>"Sakura, I shall need you soon. We shall show this upstart who is<br/>worthy of my love's heart," said the boy as he turned towards the<br/>woman behind him.<p>She looked to be in her twenties, her long brown hair done up into<br/>a pony tail at the top of her head blew in the breeze and yet remained<br/>dry despite the falling rain. She was dressed in a delicate silk<br/>kimono with a katana hanging at her side. Two deep green eyes stared<br/>forward with an almost militaristic stare as she awaited her master's<br/>commands. "It shall be as you say."<p>Kuno ignored her words and started towards the building with her<br/>following closely behind him.<p>Nabiki merely smiled at the scene, and walked into the school.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Nabiki smiled in her seat as she looked towards the boy standing<br/>over her desk. "Set up a match Kuno baby? Why I thought you'd never<br/>ask!"<p>Everything was going according to plan, she had suspected that<br/>Ranma and Kuno would not get along. The Saotome boy's gruff nature and<br/>Kuno's idiotic formality were sure to clash, she wasn't expecting this<br/>quite so soon though. "Oh well, more money for me!"<p>++++++++++++++<p>That night Ranma sat at the table reading the note Kuno had given<br/>Nabiki that morning. "He's challenging me?"<p>Akane smiled, it would be good to see him get a lesson, and<br/>something about him just made her angry. The perverted things she knew<br/>he was doing at night with that thing probably had something to do<br/>with it. She seemed to be with him almost everywhere he went. He<br/>certainly kept her out more than anyone else she knew of with a liquid<br/>unit. It was a short list though so she didn't have much to go on as<br/>far as that was concerned.<p>"Yup, Kuno baby had a liquid unit too, he want's to set up a<br/>match," replied Nabiki calmly. This was the perfect opportunity to<br/>check up on her investment. Her expectations were high, the boy had<br/>easily paid her delivery charge for the letter.<p>"I can take that idiot anytime!" cried Ranko confidently.<p>"That's good to hear, but you haven't even met Sakura yet,"<br/>snorted the girl with a deadpan gaze.<p>Ranko sat down and smiled. "She's got to be at least as stupid as<br/>he is."<p>"She's the regional champion in middle class units," replied the<br/>girl curtly.<p>"Middle class?" said Ranma in shock. "That means..."<p>"Right you are Ranma, she's stronger than Ranko," replied Nabiki<br/>with a smile.<p>"I've always wanted to see how I'd do against a higher class<br/>unit," replied the red head with a shrug.<p>It was the truth, but her air of sure win confidence was now gone.<br/>It was replaced by a hard, and determined gaze as she stared at the<br/>letter; no one else but Nabiki noticed that it mirrored Ranma's face<br/>exactly.<p>Nabiki smiled, if her suspicions where true she could make a<br/>killing tomorrow, regardless of who won.<p>++++++++++++<p>Meanwhile, Inside Tatewaki Kuno's bedroom, Sakura stood before a<br/>chalkboard writing the days lessons from school there flawlessly; it<br/>was even in the teacher's handwriting.<p>Kuno found he rarely had to pay much attention in school since he<br/>could retrieve the lessons from her memory at his leisure. Still,<br/>cheating was beneath him and he still aspired to learn the lessons as<br/>best he could. It was invaluable that he keep his grades up as a roll<br/>model and captain of the kendo club.<p>It also didn't hurt that Sakura was not wearing any clothing at<br/>the moment.<p>He relaxed and lowered his eyes to the book in his hands before<br/>placing it aside and flicking off the light.<p>The liquid unit's voice floated down to him. "Do you wish to<br/>retire? Should I continue the lesson?"<p>"You may stop," replied the boy as he lay on his mat and sighed.<p>"Shall you dream of the Tendo girl tonight master?" she asked as<br/>she kneeled next to him once again clothed in the kimono.<p>"As always my dear Sakura, shall you assist me again?" the whole<br/>event had a strange formality to it and that was just the way he liked<br/>it.<p>The liquid unit seemed to change shape in an instant revealing a<br/>perfect image of Akane Tendo sitting beside him on the bed. "Oh, my<br/>darling Kuno, thank you for saving me from my savage ways and showing<br/>me the path of true honor."<p>"It was as it should be my beloved," he replied looking away<br/>dramatically.<p>"How should I ever repay you?" asked the girl as she removed the<br/>cloth from her shoulders exposing her chest to him.<p>Kuno did not look at her. He merely stood meekly and honorably<br/>looking away. "I cannot accept such a payment."<p>"My darling Kuno, we shall be wed on the morrow! Will you accept<br/>me this night, even if it is premature?" she gasped passionately as<br/>she pulled at his back gently and caressed his shoulders.<p>"It shall be as you say!" said Kuno as he turned slowly to meet<br/>her lips. He broke the kiss and gazed into her eyes. "Tomorrow, I<br/>shall make this a reality as I destroy that dishonorable cur and his<br/>deceitful advance on Akane Tendo."<p>"Yes master, it shall be as you say!" replied Sakura with Akane's<br/>face and voice as she kissed him again.<p>They fell against the mat in passion as the night drew on.<p>++++++++++++<p>Ranma sat in the furo relaxing in the water as he thought about<br/>the coming day. "Do you think we can handle it tomorrow? A medium<br/>class unit is a big power difference."<p>Ranko looked at him from her place beside him and smiled. "That's<br/>all up to you and you know it," was her answer.<p>"I wish you'd stop dumping all this stuff on me," he replied in<br/>annoyance.<p>"Sorry Ranchan, that's the way things are," she said as she handed<br/>him a towel as they emerged from the water.<p>Ranma sighed and walked towards the changing room.<p>He stopped cold as he saw Nabiki standing there in the nude<br/>smiling at him. "Oh, finished already? I was just about to join you."<p>"Wha?" gasped the boy in shock as he backed away with a look of<br/>complete shock and terror on his face.<p>"What are you so jumpy about? We are engaged Saotome," snorted the<br/>girl as she walked by him and sat down on the stool. "Besides I would<br/>think you had some experience before now." She eyed Ranko carefully<br/>and smiled as the unit gave her an uncomprehending look.<p>Ranma quickly removed himself from the room with a completely red<br/>face as he dressed himself and got out as fast as he could. "Man, I<br/>don't know how long I can take this place."<br/>Akane stared at the scene in shock as Ranma walked out of the<br/>bathroom with an odd look on his face.<p>Nabiki had gone in there not moments before and she reasoned that<br/>her sister had thrown the boy out. "You'd better not even think about<br/>it, cause if I find out I'll kill you myself."<br/>Ranma looked at her and turned away wordlessly. Akane merely<br/>smiled to herself thinking he understood what the score was. "What the<br/>hell are these people talking about?" he asked Ranko as they reached<br/>the top of the stairs.<p>"You got me," replied the girl with a shrug. "Maybe it's just that<br/>they're all crazy?"<p>+++++++++++++<p>Liquid Fighter Gold<p>Part three<p>Ranko vs. Sakura.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Ranma Saotome sat in a field waiting patiently for his opponent to<br/>arrive as the sun set. He sighed heavily and turned to face the rather<br/>large crowd that had gathered. Many of them appeared to be students of<br/>Furinkan; many others were older people who held small slips of paper<br/>in their hands. He sighed at the familiarity of the situation and<br/>turned back to await Kuno patiently.<p>Ranko moved about the crowd freely, she took in her surroundings<br/>as best she could while avoiding the mob that had somehow gathered to<br/>observe the fight. The question of how the people had managed to find<br/>out about the fight had been answered when they first arrived an hour<br/>ago and helped Nabiki set up her table.<p>She had started taking bets immediately for those who had arrived<br/>early. Her smile fell slightly as Ranma's fiancee kept giving her odd<br/>looks as she moved among the people and she tried her best to ignore<br/>them.<p>"Hey babe, you here for the fight?" said an unfamiliar boy who<br/>walked up to her casually. He was dressed in a school uniform, but she<br/>didn't recognize him.<p>He was probably from another school. There were quite a few teens<br/>there that she didn't know from her memory files.<p>A small smile formed on her face as she turned towards him. "I<br/>sure am, come to see the show handsome?" she purred.<p>"Sure, wanna sit with me and my buddies? We've got ringside<br/>seats," said the boy, as his smile grew three times larger.<p>"No thanks, I think I'm gonna be a little closer to the action<br/>than you pal," she retorted with a girlish giggle as she started to<br/>walk away.<p>"Come on, please? I want to talk with you a little," pleaded the<br/>boy jokingly.<p>"Sorry honey, I'm with someone," she replied with an apologetic<br/>shrug.<p>"What's he got that I don't have?" snorted the boy confidently as<br/>he struck a ridiculous pose that was meant to show how cool he was.<p>She smiled warmly and turned on her heels. "Me." With that said<br/>she dashed off into the crowd again losing him in an instant.<p>"Hey..." the boy trailed off as he realized that she was a lost<br/>cause. "Lucky guy I guess."<p>Nabiki frowned at her fiancee as he leaned against the table<br/>watching the exchange with mild amusement. "You are a sick man you<br/>know that?"<p>Ranma looked at her and blinked. "What are you talking about?"<p>"I saw what you did to that poor defenseless young man. You are a<br/>cad Ranma Saotome. I kind of like that though." She gave him a playful<br/>wink and turned back to the slowly dwindling line at the table.<p>"What I did?" muttered Ranma in confusion as he turned away from<br/>her and looked towards the red head as she moved over to the food<br/>vendors near the back of the crowd. He turned his attention back<br/>towards the small field and waited patiently for his opponent to<br/>arrive.<p>++++++++++<p>After about a half-hour, a figure slowly walked towards the crowd<br/>with the sun at his back slowly fading into existence as he neared the<br/>battleground. He remained silent with his bokuten resting at his hip,<br/>as his Kendo gear slowly became visible as his features became clear.<p>"I'll say one thing for him, he knows how to make an entrance,"<br/>commented Nabiki dryly.<p>Kuno stopped and frowned as he noticed the spectators around him.<br/>"What is this?"<p>"Nothing Kuno baby, just a few witnesses," said Nabiki as she<br/>waved her hand.<p>The boy ignored her and turned towards Ranma with a cool glare.<br/>"You have turned our battle of honor into a show for the masses? This<br/>is unforgivable Saotome."<p>The boy blinked and took up a defensive posture. "Hey! This wasn't<br/>my idea! Blame her!" He pointed at Nabiki who looked at the two of<br/>them and frowned.<p>"Such cowardice, blaming your own faults on the woman you would<br/>call wife," snorted the boy as he sat on the grass crossing his legs<br/>and leaned against the tree that shades Nabiki's betting table. "For<br/>this offence I shall destroy you quickly."<p>Ranma snorted and looked back towards the crowd. "Whatever, let's<br/>just get this over with."<p>++++++++++++++<p>Ranko stood with a bag of cotton candy in her hands, she ate<br/>cheerfully while chatting with a good sized group of boys who had<br/>surrounded her and started to bombard her with questions. She stopped<br/>suddenly as her cheerful attitude fell away. "Well, looks like I'm on<br/>boys, see you later." In an instant she vanished from in front of them<br/>leaving the air puffed sugar behind leaving them all staring in shock<br/>at the space she had once occupied.<p>"What the hell? She was a liquid unit?" cried one of the boys in<br/>disgusted shock. He and his friends turned and glared daggers at<br/>Ranma, as he stood oblivious too them with his attention on Kuno as<br/>Ranko appeared next to him.<p>"That sick bastard!" snorted another one of the boys angrily.<p>++++++++++++<p>Sakura appeared in a shower of pink flower petals beside her master as<br/>Ranko materialized beside her own. The two girls stood off for a<br/>moment sizing each other up emotionlessly.<p>"Shall we begin?" said Kuno calmly as he sat in the lotus position<br/>and closed his eyes. Ranma looked at him and merely nodded his head.<p>The battle started without formalities, Sakura pulled out her<br/>Katana and sliced at Ranko, who avoided the strike and jumped into the<br/>center of the field. Kuno's unit wasted no time in catching up and<br/>rushed the girl. "You cannot defeat me, I am superior to you."<p>"We'll see about that!" retorted the red head angrily as she<br/>rushed and punched at the girl catching her in the chest and sending<br/>her skidding back a few feet. Kuno smiled as a tiny amount of energy<br/>vanished from his bar.<p>Ranma leaned forward and blinked at the strain the boy seemed to<br/>be having at the moment. "Hey Kuno, you got a headache or somethin?"<br/>he asked in genuine concern.<p>The kendoist opened his eyes and looked up at him for a moment. He<br/>almost fell over in shock, as Ranma did not appear to be paying any<br/>attention to the fight at all.<p>"What trickery is this?" He quickly turned his attention back as<br/>Ranko managed to land another blow knocking off another tiny bit of<br/>his energy.<p>"Your master has skill, it seems I must fight to win this match,"<br/>said the sword wielding unit as she slashed at the air again.<p>Ranko moved skillfully out of the way and countered the blow with<br/>a kick that was blocked. The pigtailed girl rolled away from the<br/>strike that followed and barely managed to escape. She jumped back a<br/>ways and stood in a ready position. "That was too close."<p>"You cannot hope to match me!" screamed her opponent as she<br/>charged forward with her blade becoming a blur.<p>Ranko backed away as the woman charged and gasped as several nicks<br/>and tears appeared in her clothing. She growled between her teeth and<br/>kicked off the ground putting some distance between herself and her<br/>opponent. "Damn!" Her Chinese shirt was in tatters and she only<br/>received a light blow as she escaped from the barrage of strikes.<br/>Still, the amount of energy taken away from her was about the same as<br/>all of the strikes she had managed to land on her opponent.<p>Sakura simply stood calmly and lowered her blade into a low<br/>stance. "You cannot hope to win," she said mechanically.<p>"I can always try," replied the red head simply as she rushed into<br/>the attack again. This time she managed to peg the girl in the face<br/>knocking away even more of her energy.<p>Sakura staggered for a moment as her retaliation strike missed by<br/>a hair's width. The brown haired unit simply stepped forward and took<br/>the offensive again as she charged forward slashing at an amazing<br/>speed with her blade. This time Ranko was not so fortunate, her shirt<br/>split open revealing her breast as the wind blew across the field. She<br/>didn't seem to notice, but a long red mark appeared in her chest as<br/>even more energy was lost.<p>Once again Sakura had taken as much damage from all of her strikes<br/>making their readings almost equal again.<p>Ranma stood watching the fight impassively, occasionally he would<br/>utter a cheer of encouragement towards his unit or jump around<br/>excitedly. At the moment he was dead serious, but still somewhat<br/>distracted.<p>Nabiki glanced over at him in confusion and shook her head before<br/>turning her attention towards the battle again. Either way she would<br/>make a killing, but it would be much more profitable if Ranma won.<p>Everyone hung on the edge of their seats as the pair continued to<br/>trade blows in the field, neither one hit very often, Ranko gained<br/>more blows, but Sakura had the clear advantage.<p>All this went unnoticed by a group of high school boys who<br/>approached Ranma from behind with evil looking grins on their faces.<br/>They spotted the pigtail and smirked as they approached him. He<br/>shifted about excitedly as the battle raged and moved away from Nabiki<br/>towards the center of the spectators.<p>The lead boy smiled as he pulled the lid off of a cup and walked<br/>within two feet of the pigtailed boy. He threw the contents onto his<br/>back sending Ranma into the air. "Hey! That's cold!" she cried as she<br/>spun around to see a familiar group of boys standing behind her.<p>Her eyes narrowed suddenly as they stepped back in shock. "Hey,<br/>that's the girl we were talking to," said one of the boys nervously.<p>"Uh, I'm real sorry Miss Ranko, I thought you were someone else!"<br/>gasped another one of them as he stepped away from her.<p>Ranma growled as she wiped some of the water off of her back. "I'm<br/>soaked you jerk!"<p>"Oh, man. I guess this means you don't want to go out huh?" said<br/>the boy with the now empty cup.<p>Ranma snorted and cracked her knuckles. "You got a strange way of<br/>askin a girl out ya know that?"<p>"Man, she was a real girl," whined another one of the boys as he<br/>backed away as a rather large group of angry women surrounded them.<p>"Perverts! They got her blouse wet! What do you think this is?<br/>Some kind of smutty bar?" screamed various girls within the crowd.<p>Ranma smiled a little evilly at them as a sudden realization and<br/>fear crossed all of their faces. What was about to happen would really<br/>hurt.<p>Nabiki turned away from the fight attracted by the noise as the<br/>men were pounded within an inch of their lives by the angry mob of<br/>girls and women. A familiar looking pigtail caught her attention and<br/>caused her to do a double take.<p>Ranko was in the field fighting, but she was also helping the<br/>feminist club beat the tar out of some unfortunate boys. She turned<br/>and started to speak to Ranma, only to find Kuno, still deep in<br/>concentration, sitting alone. "What the? Ranma?" She glanced around<br/>and noticed her fiance was nowhere to be seen.<p>++++++++++++++<p>Sakura slashed at the girl taking off the last remains of her<br/>shirt, the girl's pants were in tatters as well, but remained mostly<br/>intact. Ranko was still in good shape. She had more than half of her<br/>energy left while managing to whittle Sakura down to about one fourth<br/>of her reserves. They had been fighting for about fifteen minutes so<br/>far.<p>Still, only a few well-placed blows would end the fight for Ranko<br/>rather quickly. She spun into a kick and smirked as the woman<br/>staggered back. "I've got you!"<p>Sakura stood firmly as she regained her balance. "This fight ends<br/>now!"<p>Nabiki stopped her search for Ranma as Kuno suddenly got a huge<br/>grin on his face despite the strain he was putting out. "And so it<br/>ends."<p>"What?" snapped the girl as she turned back towards the battle<br/>again. Sakura's blade flew almost too fast for even Ranko to follow as<br/>she slashed upwards. "Taste the Katana Wave!"<p>A yellow arc of energy flew from the after image of the strike and<br/>slammed into the pigtailed girl's chest sending her sprawling across<br/>the ground with a look of complete shock on her face. Her energy bar<br/>drained in an instant leaving only a sliver behind.<p>One more strike and the match would be over. She struggled back to<br/>her feet while Sakura waited patiently.<p>"What the hell? You're no middle class unit!" she screamed with a<br/>look of horror appearing on her features.<p>"Quite correct, you realize this too late I'm afraid," cried the<br/>woman as she stepped forward slowly.<p>Ranko backed away nervously. Nabiki stared in shock at the<br/>spectacle not ten feet in front of her. "What the hell is this Kuno!<br/>Middle class units can't do that!"<p>"You are quite correct Nabiki Tendo, Sakura was a middle class<br/>unit at my last match. She has improved since that time, she is now a<br/>medium-heavy class unit," replied the boy without opening his eyes.<p>"You've just been playing with her!" said Nabiki as she turned<br/>back towards the pair. Ranma was retreating towards the crowd. She<br/>growled under her breath and cursed, her hopes of making a killing on<br/>the fight had ended abruptly, she how had to settle for merely coming<br/>out a few thousand yen richer. Ranma had easily beaten the spread, so<br/>she was still sitting on quite a nice profit.<p>++++++++++++<p>Sakura jumped into the air raising her blade for the final blow<br/>causing Ranko to retreat further into the crowd, not quite realizing<br/>how close she was to them. After a moment she staggered back falling<br/>on her back amongst the crowd, seeming to vanish into the mass of<br/>spectators.<p>Sakura landed and stood watching calmly as her target seemed to<br/>disappear suddenly. She turned to find her a little ways into the<br/>spectators glaring at a group of badly beaten boys with a rather<br/>satisfied look on her face.<p>"I have you! Die!" screamed a voice from behind Ranma as she<br/>slowly turned around to see Sakura descending on her from above.<p>"Huh?" she managed as she raised her arms up instinctively. The<br/>blade stopped inches from her head as if held back by some invisible<br/>force. She lowered her arm and glared at the woman. "What the hell are<br/>you doing?"<p>"What is this?" cried Kuno in shock as he strained harder<br/>suddenly.<p>Nabiki smiled at him as she realized what had happened. Sakura had<br/>somehow managed to mistake the strange girl as Ranko. She was<br/>continuing the fight, but her safety programming would not allow her<br/>to harm the girl.<p>Ranko stood from her spot on the ground and shook her head<br/>wondering why she wasn't beaten yet. She shakily rose to her feet and<br/>glared at Sakura's back as she struggled to strike Ranma with her<br/>sword and finish off the fight. "Well now, isn't this interesting?"<br/>She charged forward with a huge grin on her face.<p>Ranma blinked as a battle cry erupted from behind the crazy liquid<br/>unit, she spun around, trying to twist out of the way. Sakura grit her<br/>teeth in what appeared to be pure hatred as she struggled even harder<br/>to push the blade down.<p>Ranko was still rushing towards them when Ranma turned and moved<br/>between her and her target, her grin widened as she continued to<br/>charge.<p>After a moment a look of surprise and shock covered Sakura's<br/>features as she jolted forward sailing over Ranma's head as Ranko flew<br/>right through him in a flying sidekick.<p>Ranma smiled slightly and looked at his counterpart. "Hey, good<br/>one," she commented.<p>Ranko stood huffing for a moment before falling to her knees in<br/>exhaustion. "It's over?" Sakura lay on the ground for a moment longer<br/>before she vanished in a ripple of energy.<p>Ranma smiled at Ranko and grabbed her shoulder as her clothes<br/>reverted back to normal. "Hey! We won!"<p>Kuno stood up with a look of shocked horror on his features as<br/>Sakura faded into existence beside him. "This cannot be! How could I<br/>lose? It is impossible!"<p>He turned and gasped as he saw a short red haired girl that<br/>mirrored Ranko exactly standing with the unit with her arm around her<br/>shoulder. "I see, the fiend Saotome's luck is unimaginable."<p>Nabiki glanced around at the scene and frowned. "Where is Ranma<br/>anyway?"<p>"No doubt he has run away lest he face my wrath for such a<br/>dishonorable victory!" cried Kuno as he looked around for the boy. "I<br/>shall not allow this to stand!"<p>"For whatever the reasons Kuno, you lost today," replied Nabiki<br/>with a smirk.<p>"Never! I shall never concede defeat!" screamed the boy as he<br/>rushed off in a mad rage.<br/>"Whatever," commented Nabiki as she completely forgot about the<br/>boy and her fiance after realizing all the money she had made.<p>A very small, and very happy line appeared to collect their<br/>earnings.<p>Moments later a slightly damp Ranma Saotome walked back from the<br/>vendors near the back of the fight, once again in male form.<p>He smiled as many angry people walked by him, occasionally though<br/>someone would congratulate him. He mingled a bit as the crowd<br/>dissipated.<p>+++++++++++++<p>Nearby a lone figure pushed a thin pair of sunglasses up his nose<br/>despite the fact the sun had set about a half-hour ago. He was dressed<br/>in a leather jacket and had spiky black hair. He smiled to himself as<br/>Ranma stood with his unit talking animatedly too her. "This is...<br/>interesting."<p>++++++++++++<p>"Wow, that was great!" said Ranma proudly as he pat the red head<br/>on her back as they walked towards the table where Nabiki cheerfully<br/>counted her earnings.<p>Ranko blushed at this and smiled nervously. "Yeah, but that Kuno<br/>guy seemed a little mad though."<p>When they reached the table Ranma froze in place as his fiancee<br/>gave him a gaze of pure ice and stopped counting her money.<p>"Ranma, who was that girl?"<p>The boy blinked and turned away nervously. "Girl? What girl?"<p>"The one who looked exactly like our friend here? You know, the<br/>one who showed up just after you vanished?"<p>The boy coughed into his hand and stepped back from the table<br/>nervously. "Oh. She's no one. Just someone from China."<p>That caught Nabiki's attention definitely. "China? If there's one<br/>thing I don't like, it's competition." She looked at the pile of money<br/>in front of her and shoved it into the large purse she had brought<br/>with her. "It seems I may have to work harder than I thought to make<br/>sure we work out Ranma Saotome." She whispered to herself as she stood<br/>and walked away from him.<p>"What was that about?" said Ranko.<p>"Got me," replied the boy obliviously, the thought that Nabiki<br/>might see his female form as a possible rival had never even crossed<br/>his mind. "Come on, we've got school tomorrow. I know everyone's gonna<br/>want to hear about this too. Well, maybe not Akane, but I'm sure Pop<br/>and Mr. Tendo will want to know." Without another word Ranma started<br/>to walk after his fiancee.<p>"Hey wait up!" he called.<p>He was only a little surprised when she actually waited for him<br/>and took his arm. He didn't even notice the smile on her face wasn't<br/>one of contentment.<p>"I won't lose to the likes of her, Ranma Saotome is mine. I'm not<br/>going to lose him no matter what now."<p>TBC...<p>Next time: Ranma tells of his victory against Sakura, and the<br/>reactions he gets from his family. Some other crazy stuff happens too,<br/>also the heralding of someone else's arrival.<p>
