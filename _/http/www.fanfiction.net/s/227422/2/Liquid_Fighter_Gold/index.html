</div>Liquid Fighter Gold<p>Part 4<p>Petals in the moonlight.<p>+++++++++++<p>Ranma sat across from his father, grinning proudly, with Ranko at<br/>his side. The two men were sitting at the table, with tea set out<br/>before them. Kasumi was currently in the kitchen, preparing a late<br/>lunch.<p>"So, you won?" said Genma with a small nod.<p>"This is an impressive thing?" said Soun with an inquisitive look<br/>on his face.<p>"It's supposed to be nearly impossible," said Nabiki calmly as she<br/>watched television nearby with a bag of chips in her hands.<p>"Yeah, beating a unit with a superior power level almost never<br/>happens, much less one that's two levels above her," agreed Ranma.<br/>"Ranko did really well."<p>The redhead seemed to puff out her chest in pride for a moment.<p>"Big deal," grumbled Akane irritably as she walked into the room.<p>"Hey! I don't see you doing any better!" snapped Ranma as he<br/>frowned at her for a moment.<p>"Some of us only care about a real fight, not some stupid video<br/>game," snorted the girl as she sat down next to her sister in front of<br/>the television.<p>"It's not a video game!" said Ranma with a frown.<p>"Oh? What is it then?" said the girl in retort, rather smugly too.<p>"Controlling a liquid unit well enough to fight, takes a great<br/>deal of mental discipline, Akane," said Genma sagely.<p>"Then how does that idiot Kuno manage it?" replied the girl with<br/>an unimpressed smirk.<p>"Kuno?" muttered Ranma as he appeared to think about it for a<br/>moment.<p>"He said discipline, not intelligence," pointed out Nabiki. "You<br/>of all people should know, Kuno is focused if nothing else."<p>"Focused on me maybe," grumbled the girl quietly. "That<br/>perverted..."<p>"Oh, so you do understand then?" said Nabiki cheerfully.<p>"What would you know about this anyway? You're not a martial<br/>artist, and you don't have one of those things in your brain," snapped<br/>Akane as she glared at her sister.<p>"Brain?" muttered Ranma in confusion.<p>"It's my business to know these things," said Nabiki lazily. She<br/>had yet to look away from the television throughout the entire<br/>conversation.<p>"Jeez, what a grouch," commented Ranko as she watched Akane fume<br/>for a moment.<p>The girl turned and looked at Ranma. "What did you say to me?"<p>"What?" said the boy in surprise. "I didn't say nuthin! It was<br/>her!" He pointed towards Ranko, who was sitting innocently beside him.<p>"It's the same thing!" snapped Akane.<p>"It isn't!" he retorted as he stood up and backed away.<p>"Actually, it kinda is," said Ranko cheerfully.<p>"You shut up!" said Ranma as he glared at the redhead. She stuck<br/>her tongue out at him and pulled down her eyelid for a moment.<p>"Cute Ranma," commented Nabiki as she looked at them for a moment.<p>"How stupid do you think I am?" snapped Akane as she jumped up and<br/>stalked towards him.<p>"Akane, please don't hit my fiance again," said Nabiki lazily.<br/>"Even if he does deserve it."<p>"Quit callin me that!" protested Ranma, he was ignored by both<br/>girls.<p>Akane growled and looked down at her older sister for a moment.<br/>"What?"<p>"You heard me, even if he is a jerk, and a pervert, it's my<br/>problem, not yours," said the girl lazily. Her eyes narrowed, but she<br/>still did not look away from the television. "I've got to protect my<br/>investment after all, it won't do for Akane to hurt him too much, or<br/>scare him away," she thought to herself.<p>"Who are you callin a pervert?" said Ranma and Ranko in unison.<p>"You! Now stay out of this!" snapped Akane.<p>"Fine! I don't gotta take this crap! Come on Ranko," said Ranma as<br/>he turned away and left the room angrily. He moved outside, towards<br/>the dojo.<p>"I'm glad to see you coming to your fiance's defense, Nabiki,"<br/>commented Soun as he picked up a newspaper.<p>Akane glared daggers at her father for a moment. "What? I can't<br/>believe this!"<p>"Akane, calm down," said Soun sternly. He immediately burst into<br/>tears after that though. "You know it upsets your daddy when you yell<br/>at him that way!"<p>"Honestly!" snarled Akane as she walked away from the scene in<br/>frustration.<p>+++++++++++<p>"So, now what?" asked Ranko as she looked around at the inside of<br/>the dojo almost absently.<p>"What else? We spar," said Ranma as the scowl on his face lessened<br/>slightly.<p>"Ah, well, I can dream can't I?" quipped the girl as her clothes<br/>shifted from a red and black Chinese outfit like the one he was<br/>wearing, into a red dogi.<p>"About what?" said Ranma obliviously. He stood there looking at<br/>her for a moment in confusion.<p>"Never mind," said the girl with a small sigh.<p>"Whatever," he said with a shrug. They bowed to one another, and<br/>stood off in the middle of the dojo. "Ready?"<p>"That depends, are you?" said the girl with her cheery grin<br/>appearing on her face again.<p>"Anytime," said the boy as he jumped forward. She reacted the same<br/>way, and the acrobatic battle began.<p>Ranma and Ranko met each other halfway and seemed to hover for a<br/>moment, exchanging punches and kicks as they passed. Both landed on<br/>their feet opposite one another and quickly turned, facing each other<br/>again.<p>"Not bad," commented Ranko lazily.<p>"I only scored half what you did," he muttered dejectedly.<p>"I'll always be better," commented Ranko cheerfully.<p>"Shut up," he said quietly as he charged forward again. This time,<br/>the pair raced forward, intercepting one another on the ground.<br/>Ranma's arms became a blur as he attacked, Ranko responded by blocking<br/>each blow with her own. Ranma's fists weren't stopped by her defense,<br/>but he could feel each block and frowned deeper for a moment before<br/>spinning into a series of kicks.<p>Ranko dodged around these attacks, weaving in and out of his<br/>attack pattern as easily as he had evaded Akane's maneuvers. She<br/>paused and winked at him. "Ready to turn it up a bit?" she said<br/>cheerily.<p>"Yeah, that's enough warm up," said Ranma as he suddenly got a<br/>strange look in his eyes.<p>"Let's go then!"<p>++++++++++++<p>A battle cry from the dojo caught everyone in the living room's<br/>attention. The Tendo's looked outside in confusion, while Genma merely<br/>sat with his arms crossed, not paying it any mind at all.<p>"Saotome?" said Soun with a slightly worried tone.<p>"It's nothing to worry about, my son is just sparring," said Genma<br/>with a small nod.<p>Nabiki blinked, and looked up the stairs. Akane had gone up to her<br/>room, and there was no way she had gone out into the dojo. Not unless<br/>she had climbed out her window, and that was very unlikely. She looked<br/>towards Genma again. "With who?"<p>Genma chuckled and shook his head for a moment. "With Ranko, of<br/>course."<p>"What?" said Nabiki as her face contorted into an undisguised mask<br/>of shock. "That's impossible!"<p>"Hmm, so I've heard," said Genma with a small nod. He lazily<br/>sipped at his tea and relaxed a bit more.<p>His reply went unheard. Nabiki was already rushing out to the dojo<br/>as fast as she could run. She stopped in the door and simply stared in<br/>a dazed sort of fascination.<p>Ranma and Ranko were moving around the dojo like Ping-Pong balls.<br/>Trading blows at an amazing rate of speed as they moved in and out of<br/>one another's attack range. Ranko was clearly winning, but Ranma was<br/>somehow keeping up with her maddening pace none the less.<p>"Whoa," said Nabiki as she stepped back from the door. She could<br/>hear the sweet sound of a cash register in the back of her mind. Ranma<br/>wasn't just some hotshot kid the way the magazines described him. She<br/>had thought he'd enter a few tournaments, and make a very decent<br/>living fighting. Now, she realized that the Liquid Fighter Gold<br/>tournament was a very real possibility. Give him time, and practice,<br/>and she'd be a rich wife, even if he never won the big fight. She<br/>pushed her back against the outside wall of the dojo, clutching her<br/>hands to her chest with a huge blush forming on her face. "Jackpot."<p>+++++++++++<p>Tatewaki Kuno sat in quiet contemplation. Sakura stood before him,<br/>with what appeared to be mournful tears in her face. She was nude, and<br/>tied up across a low table.<p>He raised his hand again, and brought down the long bamboo cane<br/>across her naked chest once again.<p>"No! Please! No more master! I shall not fail you again!" pleaded<br/>the woman desperately.<p>"Very well, see too it that you do not," said Kuno firmly as he<br/>slid the cane pole across her belly.<p>The woman shuddered as the action irritated the welts that covered the<br/>length of her body. She sobbed pitifully and whimpered a few more<br/>pleas.<p>"Your error has been corrected," said Kuno as he stood up and<br/>turned away from her. "You may leave me now, the sight of you disgusts<br/>me."<p>Sakura's painful and pleading face vanished in an instant,<br/>replaced by the cold indifference once again. "As you wish master."<br/>The welts were gone, and her clothes returned once again. She vanished<br/>in a small shower of sakura petals, leaving him alone with his<br/>thoughts.<p>"Curse the luck of that upstart," growled Kuno bitterly. "How can<br/>Sakura fail me? She has always been victorious before now! I do not<br/>understand where she erred." He looked out at the night sky, gazing<br/>into the stars for a long moment.<p>"Units cannot err, units can only follow commands," said a<br/>slightly metallic sounding singsong voice from the shadows near the<br/>doorway of the room. It seemed almost electronic and childlike at the<br/>same time.<p>"I have asked you not to appear in my chambers," said Kuno, he did<br/>not bother to turn away from the window.<p>"Unit does not recognize the authority of designator," said the<br/>voice in reply.<p>"Why are you here?" said Kuno.<p>"To observe, mistress has asked Unit to observe why sibling is<br/>upset. Now Unit knows," said the voice. It giggled almost madly at<br/>him.<p>"Go and give your report then. I have no desire for your company,"<br/>said Kuno as he turned to look at the thing at last, he saw only<br/>darkness.<p>"Unit does not require instruction to do so," replied the thing<br/>giddily.<p>Kuno narrowed his eyes, he searched the room for a moment.<br/>Finally, he spotted it. A single white spot in the far corner. It was<br/>vaguely face shaped and appeared to have a black smile, and a painted<br/>black tear under its right eye. Finally, a child like body seemed to<br/>melt away from the shadows, clad completely in black. It looked like a<br/>small clown, a harlequin. It appeared to be female, but had a wiry<br/>thin body, and black jester's hood that completely covered its head,<br/>accept for the face.<p>"You are still here?"<p>"Protocol one, Unit must contradict orders from sibling," said the<br/>thing with a small shrug. The sound of bells jingling accompanied this<br/>action.<p>"Demon! I said be gone!" roared Kuno as he pulled one of his<br/>bokuten from the wall. "Desist this maddening annoyance and leave my<br/>bedchambers at once!" He pointed the weapon at the thing angrily.<p>"Unit cannot be harmed by such weapons," said the thing calmly.<p>"Then there is truly no justice in this world," said Kuno as he<br/>lowered the blade, keeping his gaze trained on the thing. "If any<br/>blade can smite such a creature, it is the sword of the Blue Thunder!"<br/>He charged forward and hacked at the thing angrily, destroying a<br/>dresser in the process.<p>"Unit still feels nothing, and sibling has lost another dresser,"<br/>commented the clown as it looked over its shoulder calmly.<p>"Cur!" roared Kuno.<p>"Sibling has now lost a bed roll as well, and two large<br/>photographs of his lowly wench," said the clown as it simply stood in<br/>the path of the strikes.<p>Kuno frowned. "You have destroyed my honorable shrine of the<br/>goddess, Akane Tendo? You shall be punished! You are not worthy to be<br/>smitten by my own hands! Sakura! Before me!"<p>"Yes master?" said Sakura as she appeared beside him, in another<br/>shower of flower petals.<p>"Take care of this lowly creature, I will not have it disturbing<br/>my meditation!" snarled Kuno as he pointed into the shadows.<p>"Designated target not found," said Sakura as she merely stood<br/>there.<p>Kuno blinked and looked around his room. There was nothing there<br/>any longer; it had left immediately after Sakura had been summoned.<br/>"No doubt it feared my prowess."<p>"Indeed, there are none who would not," agreed Sakura.<p>++++++++++++++<p>The sky was dark, the stars were out, and Nabiki Tendo, could not<br/>sleep.<p>"Dang," she muttered lazily. She stood up and walked out of her<br/>room, there wasn't much she could do really. She decided to go down<br/>and have a cup of warm milk, to perhaps help her rest a bit.<p>"Hello Nabiki," said a familiar voice.<p>The girl froze, and slowly turned around. "Wha?"<p>Ranko was looking at her, with a small smile on her face. She<br/>looked cheerful as always, and walked up beside her. "What are you<br/>doing up at this hour?"<p>"I uh, couldn't sleep. Is Ranma awake?" said Nabiki with a<br/>slightly nervous tone.<p>"No," replied the redhead with a small shrug.<p>"Then...how?" stammered Nabiki with the worry creeping into her<br/>tone a bit more.<p>"He's in REM sleep. His brain is active, so I'm available, so to<br/>speak," replied the girl with a small shrug.<p>"Oh. You can do that?" said Nabiki as she started walking down the<br/>stairs towards the kitchen.<p>Ranko followed close behind her, looking rather bored. "Yeah, I'm<br/>programmed to do things. Like clean the house, or something. Ranma<br/>doesn't like me to do things like that for him, and Kasumi keeps the<br/>rest of the house clean, so I just sit up and watch him most of the<br/>time. I heard you moving around, and came out to check on what the<br/>noise was."<p>"Weird," commented Nabiki. "Kinda like a burglar alarm or<br/>something?"<p>"I suppose. I don't have anything else to do though, it's pretty<br/>boring," said the redhead with a shrug.<p>"I've heard that, he remembers what you see," said Nabiki as she<br/>opened the refrigerator and pulled out a carton of milk. "Is that<br/>true?"<p>"Not exactly remembers," said Ranko as she sat on the counter and<br/>watched the girl make her drink. "It's kinda hard to describe, but if<br/>I see or hear something, he knows about it. It isn't a memory though."<p>"So, I couldn't keep a secret from him if I told you. Right?" said<br/>Nabiki with a smirk appearing on her face for a moment.<p>"It only works when he's awake, you could say anything you wanted<br/>right now, and he won't remember a thing," said Ranko cheerfully.<p>"Really? Great!" said Nabiki as she finished heating the milk and<br/>poured it into a cup. "What's he like in bed?"<p>Ranko paused and looked at her for a moment. "Huh?"<p>"Jeez, you actually look surprised," commented Nabiki as she eyed<br/>the girl carefully.<p>"I...dunno," said the redhead.<p>"Really? Dunno as in you aren't sure what good is? Or as in, you<br/>really don't know?" asked Nabiki calmly as she sipped at her drink.<p>"I suppose that it's true I wouldn't really know, but also because<br/>he's never used me for that," said the girl with a small giggle. "I've<br/>offered plenty of times. I'm programmed to react to an erection that<br/>way. He always says no though." Ranko's brow furrowed slightly as she<br/>thought about it. "It's starting to bug me."<p>"Bug you?" said Nabiki with her eyebrow raising slightly.<p>"Well, yeah! I know I'm programmed for it and all, but it's kinda<br/>frustrating to repeatedly throw yourself at someone, and have them<br/>turn you down over and over. I guess it kinda built up over the<br/>years."<p>"How long?" asked Nabiki as she leaned in towards the girl.<p>"Well, he had his first one when he was ten, so...six years or<br/>so," said Ranko with a thoughtful frown appearing on her face.<p>"I was kind of expecting you to give me an exact date. You're not<br/>like the other units I've seen," said Nabiki as she smiled at the<br/>redhead for a moment.<p>"Well, my personality is modeled after his. It happens over time,<br/>and we've been together almost ten years now."<p>Nabiki nodded at this, "Plus, the unusual level of control..." She<br/>was speaking more to herself than Ranko.<p>"I suppose that might have something to do with it," said Ranko<br/>with a small shrug.<p>"Well, I've got to get up tomorrow. See you later Ranko," said<br/>Nabiki as she walked out of the kitchen, leaving the redhead sitting<br/>alone.<p>"Right," said Ranko with a small sigh. She waved her hand at the<br/>girl, and blinked out of existence.<p>+++++++++++<p>"Ranma Saotome," said a man dressed in a black leather jacket. He<br/>was looking at a photo taken during the match with Sakura that had<br/>occurred that morning. "Interesting indeed." He chuckled as he put the<br/>photo into his pocket. He was currently sitting inside a dimly lit<br/>bar, not paying much attention to anything. A shot of something rested<br/>on the counter in front of him. He looked at it for a moment,<br/>realizing that he'd forgotten what he'd ordered.<p>The bartender noticed him move and smirked. "Welcome back, you've<br/>been staring at that photo for about four hours now."<p>"I've been looking for someone, and I think I finally found him,"<br/>said the man calmly.<p>The barkeep frowned. "This ain't that kinda bar. I ain't got<br/>nuthin against you, but if you start bothering my customers..."<p>"What? I don't mean that!" snapped the man defensively.<p>"Just makin sure," said the bartender curtly.<p>"I'm a Liquid Fighter, I've been looking for someone very special<br/>for a long time. I think that this time, I may have actually found<br/>someone who might make the cut. Thing is, they still got a ways to go<br/>yet."<p>"Fighter Class?" asked the barkeep with a slightly odd look in his<br/>eyes.<p>"My name is Ryo, and I'm afraid Inu Musume is a bit out of your<br/>league," he placed a card on the counter and smirked.<p>The barkeep calmed suddenly as he looked at the card. His hand<br/>shrank down to clean the inside of a shot glass in his hand. "I see.<br/>You're a gold competitor."<p>"Yup," said the man with a smirk. He picked up the card and put it<br/>inside his pocket.<p>"We don't get many of your kind in here," commented the barkeep<br/>lazily as he picked up another glass and began to wipe it down.<p>"I imagine not," said the man as he looked around. The bar was<br/>relatively small, and had only a few customers inside it.<p>"This kid, Ranma, could be a major competitor if he keeps up the<br/>way he is. I'd like to meet him," said Ryo lazily. He picked up the<br/>shot glass and downed it in a swift motion. "I'll be keeping my eye on<br/>him in any case."<p>"Hmm," said the barkeep as he picked up the glass, and the money<br/>Ryo had lain on the counter as well.<p>"See you around," said Ryo as he pulled a thin pair of shades out<br/>of his pocket and put them on his face as he started towards the door.<p>The barkeep merely nodded and continued his work.<p>++++++++++<p>Meanwhile...<p>"Where are we?" said a rather well dressed young man who stood in<br/>the middle of the street. He was wearing a dark blue business suit,<br/>and didn't seem very worried about the rather rough looking<br/>neighborhood he had found himself in. Tucked into his jacket lapel,<br/>was a yellow and black handkerchief.<p>"Kyushu," replied a gruff sounding voice from beside him.<p>"Are you sure? We're supposed to be going to Tokyo," said the boy<br/>as he looked up at his companion. It was a semi-human something that<br/>was mostly hidden by the shadows. It was also almost three times his<br/>size, and wearing a long black trench coat and hat.<p>"Most certain master," said the thing with a nod of its head.<p>"Great," muttered the boy as he looked down at the ground. He<br/>flicked some lint off of his pants absently and sighed. "Are we sure<br/>he's in Tokyo?"<p>"According to the last report sir," said the thing.<p>"Great! Ranma Saotome, I've found you at last! I'll finally get my<br/>revenge!" said the boy as he jumped up in the air. "Get ready, Ryoga<br/>Hibiki is coming for you at last!"<p>"Yes, sir," agreed the thing calmly.<p>"Come on, let's get out of here," said Ryoga as he whirled around.<br/>He walked up next to a rather mean looking motorcycle and straddled<br/>it. With a quick flick of his foot, the engine roared to life,<br/>drowning out almost all other sounds on the street.<p>"Are you certain we can't walk, sir?" said the thing as it looked<br/>at Ryoga for a moment.<p>"Huh? Why?" said the boy obliviously.<p>"We've always had an easier time finding things when I've guided<br/>you, sir," replied the thing calmly.<p>"Aw, don't worry about it! I'll get there in no time! This is much<br/>faster than walking!" said Ryoga as he gunned the engine and tore down<br/>the street.<p>The thing sighed for a moment, just before it vanished into thin<br/>air. "Yes, sir."<p>++++++++++++++<p>"Okay, great," muttered Ranma as he looked up at the smiling face<br/>that was directly over his own.<p>"You're not getting up though," said Ranko cheerfully.<p>"That's right," said Ranma with a small frown. He closed his eyes<br/>again and settled back down onto his mat.<p>"You know what the old man is gonna do right?" said Ranko as she<br/>poked his nose lightly.<p>"Throw me out the window again?" muttered Ranma lazily.<p>"Probably," agreed Ranko with a small smirk. "As long as you<br/>already know."<p>At that exact moment, Genma burst into the room. "What are you<br/>still doing asleep boy!"<p>+++++++++++++<p>Nabiki looked up at the clock as Ranma sailed into the yard from<br/>above, screaming as he fell, and landed rather roughly in the yard.<p>"Right on time, I could almost set my watch to this," commented<br/>Nabiki lazily.<p>"That dope," muttered Akane as she watched from nearby. She was<br/>dressed in her jogging out fit. "I'm going now."<p>"Don't let me stop you," said Nabiki absently as she watched the<br/>houseguests fight amongst themselves in the back yard.<p>"Hiya!" said Ranko lazily as she sat down next to Nabiki at the<br/>table.<p>"Gah!" cried the girl as she clutched her chest in shocked<br/>surprise. "What are you doing here?"<p>"Watching Ranma spar with the old man," said Ranko sunnily.<p>"Right," muttered Nabiki as she turned towards the yard.<p>Ranma sailed through the air and landed on his back, a few feet<br/>away from the koi pond. "Watch it old man! You almost knocked me into<br/>that thing!"<p>"Don't be such a girl!" retorted Genma.<p>"Ranma should have avoided that," said Ranko with her brow<br/>furrowing slightly. "I know he can do better than that."<p>"Maybe so," agreed Nabiki with a light smile.<p>"I know so," said Ranko as she looked over at the girl proudly.<p>"Whatever. Hey Ranko?"<p>"Huh? What?"<p>"How big is it?"<p>"How big is what?"<p>"You know," Nabiki leaned in, jabbing the girl in her ribs<br/>lightly.<p>"Oh! That!" said Ranko as she seemed to understand finally.<p>Ranma fell to the ground in the yard with a look of shock on his<br/>face. Genma paused as his son spun around and rushed towards the<br/>house, his face had gone completely red.<p>"About this long," said Ranko as she held her hands apart.<p>"Hey! Not bad," commented Nabiki.<p>Both girls turned to see Ranma burst into the room. "Don't tell<br/>people about that!"<p>"Huh? Why not?" said Ranko obliviously.<p>"It's none of..." Ranma started, he was cut off by Nabiki.<p>"Excuse me, fiance, but it is my business to know," she said and<br/>gave him a small wink. Her smile hid something more, now she was sure,<br/>what Ranko had told him the night before was true. She'd have to watch<br/>what she said around the redhead, but it could become a useful tool<br/>for her if she played her cards right.<p>"It ain't!" snapped Ranma.<p>"What are you doing boy? Get back out here!" said Genma as he<br/>walked in behind his son.<p>"Fine! Take this old man!" cried Ranma as he jumped into his<br/>father's chest, forcing the man to back out of the home.<p>"Oh well, at least he's got something to vent his frustrations<br/>on," commented Ranko.<p>"Right," said Nabiki with a disinterested shrug.<p>++++++++++++<p>TBC...<p>Next Time: P-chan rides into town...<p>
