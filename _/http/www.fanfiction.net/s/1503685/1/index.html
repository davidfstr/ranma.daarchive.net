</div><p>Retribution for the Damned</p><p>by DigiSim</p><p>Prologue</p><p>Kasumi Tendo was pissed.</p><p>This fact in and of itself would generally seem to be an  impossibility. Usually it is for the simple truth that Kasumi is the sweetest  and kindest person on the planet. That may be true in some cases; however it  didn't apply just now. She had been running for her life for a while now.  Kasumi was tired, she was edgy and she was running out of ammo.</p><p><i>Not</i> a good  combination.</p><p>Many years ago, when Kasumi still lived in Nerima, a  terrible incident occurred. Usually it's the death of Kimiko Tendo that alters  the rest of the Tendo family. That event in her life had already come and gone.  By the time the eldest Tendo daughter was 12, Soun Tendo had made a big  mistake. He followed the advice of his middle child, a precocious young cutie  named Nabiki who had a knack for numbers. The advice wasn't <i>bad</i>, said advice being to invest in a  pharmaceutical company; it was the <i>people</i>  who ran the company that caused the trouble.</p><p>Kasumi's father, the head of the Tendo School of Anything  Goes Martial Arts, was first and foremost, not all there. He had done many disreputable  things while training. Lying, cheating and stealing had been done <i>'in the name of the Art.'</i> His best  skills were quietly breaking into places he wasn't supposed to be, a talent he  later passed on to his daughters but not on purpose. Somehow, the skill shifted  to them. Too bad for him that he was usually discovered, most times while going  through some woman's panty drawer.</p><p>During his training trip, Soun made the wrong people mad.  His friend, a stocky man by the name of Genma Saotome, and he had entered a  town with their 'Dread Master' and through brow beating, the shriveled up  little pervert threatened them into raiding some houses. Soun and Genma however  did not like the way the town <i>'felt.'</i>  The old pervert just thought they were slacking off, but kept the idea to  himself that he felt they were right about the town. It was like an open sore  in the earth, one that never fully healed or perhaps was enforced to fester and  rot. There were creeping terrors in that vile little village that haunted the  three men's dreams and waking hours for years to come. Soun had snuck into one particular  house and discovered a safe that was filled with information that would have  given a lesser man a heart attack on the spot. The horrid and graphic details  were scarred on his psyche for life but the effects weren't revealed till the  death of his wife years later whenever his emotions ran rampant.</p><p>Without knowing it, he had painted a huge target on himself  and his family just by reading those documents. They all described secret plots  or medical descriptions of the abominations of nature that were residing there  and in other towns worldwide. He never made the connection to the secret  organization and the pharmaceutical company until it was too late. By then, the  shock troops of the Umbrella Corporation razed the dojo to the ground and Soun,  along with Akane and Nabiki, was never heard from again.</p><p>It was Genma that had found Kasumi at the ruins of her home.  He had planned to take his son on a ten year training trip to get him away from  the softening influence of his mother. He tried to convince her that it had to  be done and had even written up a seppuku pledge to prove it. She 'convinced'  him <i>[she beat the ever-loving snot out of  him]</i> that he was mistaken. He quickly saw the wisdom of her logic, in other  words, he crumbled like a sandcastle in a tsunami. She did let him go out with  Ranma every other year but made him promise to come back so he would be trained  by her. Since this was a Nodoka year, Genma didn't really have anything to do. He  had to admit that his wife's plan was sound though. He had never been more fit  in his life thanks to a diet she made him adhere to and had a full head of hair  along with a newly grown beard and moustache. Someday they might even decide to  have more children so Ranma wouldn't grow up alone.</p><p>Genma was particularly bored that day so he had decided to  go visit his old training partner. He also had to tell Soun that the plan for  uniting the schools <i>[Nodoka found out  about the engagement and beat him worse than when he showed her the seppuku  pledge]</i> needed to be changed. When he got to the dojo, the unnatural quiet  of the neighborhood put him on edge. As he walked through the gate, the sight  of smoldering rubble took him by surprise. Kneeling where the step to the front  door would have been was a young girl with her back to him. She had a canvas sack  dropped unceremoniously next to her and was obviously crying. He could see  there was an unbroken bottle of soy sauce tipped over on its side and resting  against her ankle but that was the farthest thing from her mind at the moment. She  had been shopping for groceries and had come home to discover her family and  home gone. Without prompting, he knelt down next to her and gathered her in his  arms. She almost ran off screaming until she saw it was her Uncle Genma, though  he was a little hairier than she remembered, and she started sobbing into his  chest.</p><p>Genma took Kasumi back to his home, carrying her for most of  the way because she cried herself to sleep. He had his suspicions on what had  happened being connected to that dead town. The only reason he or his family  weren't targeted was due to the fact that Soun was the one caught on a security  camera going through the safe. Nodoka of course needed no convincing to let  Kasumi stay with them, especially after what Genma told her about what had  happened at what once was the Tendo home. As time went on, Kasumi adjusted to  life with the Saotomes. She even got training from the both of them, just like  Ranma. Whenever it was a Genma year, both she and Ranma would head out and  train. During one such trip, the both of them met up with one Ukyo Kuonji,  Okonomiyaki Martial Artist in training. She and her father had set up shop near  the American Army base in Nagasaki  and were doing quite well for themselves.</p><p>It took Ranma a while to realize that this girl Ukyo was his  childhood friend Ucchan. Back when they first met, he had thought she was a he.  They had almost become engaged back then but Genma didn't go along with it. He  had to wonder what type of man would sell his daughter's future for just a  simple yatai. Though nothing came of Kuonji-sans attempt, a friendship was  started that would last a lifetime. The three wanderers were grateful to see  the Kuonjis for the simple reason being, they were starving. Because of their  connections with the base personnel, Kuonji-san and his daughter were able to  get the trio access so they could train. Besides hand to hand combat, they also  gained weapons training. Ranma and Kasumi were both quite skilled with the  Glock 9mm as well as rifle style weapons, such as the AK-47. Of course, they  needed practice to hit the targets right, but they were both quick studies.  Even Genma took to the training, proving himself to be adept as well.</p><p>While at the base, Genma met a man named Trent.  He was a mysterious sort, but Genma felt he could trust him. When he wasn't  training with Kasumi, Ranma or both of them, he spent what time he could with Trent.  It was like Soun had come back in a way, in the form of this strange man.</p><p>One night, while Genma and Trent were at the Officer's Club  swapping stories, Ranma and Kasumi were in their on base home swapping spit.  The two had grown close over the three years that Kasumi had spent with the  Saotomes. The fact that Kasumi was fifteen and Ranma twelve didn't really  bother them in the least. Hormones will be hormones. Kasumi and Ranma had been  each other's First Kiss back when Ranma turned ten. Over time, they  experimented with each other but never got farther than topless groping or  fondling each others privates with their pants and underwear down around their  knees. There was one night that Kasumi was filled with a surge of boldness and  suckled Ranma's manhood till he ejaculated in her mouth. The reason they never  removed their pants and underwear completely was in case they would get caught.  It made oral sex a little difficult but fun nonetheless. It was a needless  precaution however since they never did get caught. That night, with Genma and  Trent gone, Kasumi and Ranma gave up their virginity to each other totally and  willingly.</p><p>The two lay nude on the couch in each other's arms, kissing  with passion, as if each kiss would be their last. Ranma's prick was aching and  stiff, the constant rubbing against Kasumi's hot and shaved bare mound nearly  drove him over the edge as their movement grew more heated. Soon, Kasumi spread  her legs under him and guided him to her soaking entrance. Their gasp of  pleasure as the head of Ranma's young cock slid between Kasumi's labia was like  a rifle shot in the otherwise quiet house. The only things of Ranmas that had  entered her down there before were usually his questing fingers or his hungry  tongue. As he slid in deeper, he encountered a barrier. He knew it was her  hymen thanks to his mother teaching him the things his father would not. Gazing  into Kasumi's eyes, he silently asked her if she was ready for him. With a  little fear in her own, she answered back that she was.</p><p>With a quick thrust, he broke through all the way till their  pubic areas were mashed together. If their earlier gasp was like a rifle shot,  Kasumis cry of pain was like a hand grenade going off. After some reassuring  kisses from both parties, the two got into an easy sliding rhythm that brought  them both over the edge quickly. As Ranmas semen splattered against Kasumis  vaginal walls, it triggered an explosive orgasm deep in her soul. While her orgasm  continued, the walls of her vagina massaged and milked Ranmas shaft which  triggered an explosion of soul light that nearly made him faint. After resting  for a few minutes, the young lovers resumed their activities. Half an hour  later, Ranma had his second orgasm of the night and Kasumi had her ninth. When  they finished resting a while more, the two got off the couch and shared a  shower that turned into Ranma's third and fourth as well as Kasumi's fourteenth  soul light explosion that night.</p><p>When Genma and Trent returned later that night, they never  suspected what had happened. Unfortunately, the couch would never be the same  again.</p><p>Shaking off the memories for the moment, Kasumi spotted a  door up ahead. "Thank God," she muttered as she ran towards it. Once on the  other side, she slammed it closed and locked it. Hearing her pursuers banging  ineffectually against it on the other side gave her a sense of relief. Pretty  soon, she heard them shuffle off and she let out a sigh. Grateful that the door  was made of solid steel, she turned around to check out where she was. It was a  warehouse of some sort. Down a very short flight of metal steps was an eighteen  wheeler's cargo hauler. Off to her direct left was a cement walkway that ended  in another flight of stairs, these went up however. There was also what  appeared to be a sort of office up there. As she took one step forward to check  out the trailer, she heard a scream of fright.</p><p>"D-don't come any closer! I'm warning you!"</p><p>Kasumi was surprised to see a man brandishing an iron bar at  her. "Relax sir, I'm a human." The man sagged visibly and nearly dropped the  bar. "Oh thank God. I thought you were one of them. What is going on in this  town?"</p><p>"That's a little complicated. By the way, I'm Kasumi. Kasumi  Tendo. Who are you?" Straightening up, the man replied, "I'm George. George Romero.  My family and I were driving through town when some maniac jumped out in front  of our car. I wasn't able to stop in time and I hit him. Cracked the damn  windshield and everything. My wife would have called for an ambulance but there  were no payphones nearby and our cell phones don't seem to work here. While we  were arguing about who we should try to call, the guy I hit attacked one of my  kids. They both got out of the car to see him and he grabbed Melissa by the  throat and he…<i>Oh God!</i>"</p><p>Kasumi watched as George bent over an open barrel and  vomited. She guessed that the guy he hit must have done something terrible to  his daughter to warrant this reaction, even if it is just from a memory.  "George, are you alright?"</p><p>"Am I <i>alright?</i>  What kind of stupid question <i>is</i> that?  Of <i>course</i> I'm not alright! I saw some  freak <i>EAT MY DAUGHTER'S FACE!</i> He,  he pulled her down to him and bit into her forehead and ri-ripped her face off  with his teeth! It happened so damn fast, we couldn't <i>do</i> anything. When my wife and I finally unfroze, it was too late. I  beat that bastard with the tire iron I keep in the trunk but he just wouldn't  stop moving. I had to cave in his skull for him to stop. Luckily, I kicked him  off of Mel before I started. If I had been paying attention, Annie would have  survived at least."</p><p>With a look of horror on her face, Kasumi asked him what had  happened to Annie. He told her that another sicko came out of nowhere and  grabbed his other daughter. His wife was quick enough to wrest her away from  the creep but grabbed her. He then bit her neck and chewed. George was too late  to save his wife Annie, but he and his other daughter Jennifer got away. He  went on to tell her about how the two of them tried to get out of town. The car  was almost out of gas. It wouldn't make it out of town, let alone the next five  blocks. As they were walking away, a semi tanker drove by and sideswiped the  car, turning it into a mangled wreck. George went on to tell Kasumi how he and  Jennifer got separated briefly and when he found her again, she had become  another victim. He wrapped up his story by telling her that he had found this  warehouse and decided to hide in the trailer till he felt like leaving.</p><p>"It's like everybody in town has gone insane. They're all  cannibals or something. What is going on? And why do they look like they're  rotting?" Kasumi told him of the T-Virus and how it turned people into flesh-eating  zombies. "<i>Zombies?</i> Do you <i>really</i> expect me to believe that? This  isn't some horror movie, this is real life. Look, if you're not going to help  me then just leave me alone." George then turned around and ran to the back of  the trailer. He climbed in and shut the doors behind himself, locking them from  the inside. Kasumi just sighed and headed back up the metal stairs. She would  check out the area a little later for any supplies that might be lying around. She  then went to the office, hoping that she could get a little rest and maybe find  some ammo as well. For some reason, ever since this whole mess started,  handgun, shotgun and rifle ammo was a little easier to come by sometimes. Even  normal and strange rounds for grenade launchers could be found. She didn't  understand it, but she wasn't complaining. As Kasumi sat in the office chair,  her mind wandered back to her past, and what lead her to where she currently  was in her life.</p><p>"<i>America</i><i>?</i> What do you mean we're moving to America?"</p><p>Nodoka Saotome, wife and mother of Genma and Ranma Saotome  respectively, was confused. Her husband had just dropped a bombshell on the  family by casually mentioning a move to another country. It was obvious by  everybody's attitude around the dinner table that this would be no ordinary  meal. Kasumi had just blurted out the question that was on Nodoka's, and most  likely Ranma's, mind. She turned her gaze to her husband, patiently awaiting  his answer.</p><p>"As you know Kasumi, I've been in contact with Trent  ever since our trip to Nagasaki.  He's the one that convinced me that a move would be good. I'm thinking of your  and Ranma's future. From what he tells me, there are more opportunities in America  when it comes to either jobs or schooling. Here in Japan,  going to college won't automatically guarantee you a good job. I've finally  learned that the sexist views of Japanese society are just plain wrong. After  all the years of training you and Ranma have gone through, do you want to just  throw it all away by being stuck in some dead-end job as an O.L.?" Kasumi had  to admit that he had a point. Nodoka and Ranma also found they felt he was  right. Ranma, however, was curious about something.</p><p>"Hey Pop, what about our training? I thought Kasumi and I  had farther to go. What about our trips?" Genma turned to his son and said, "I  had been meaning to talk to the two of you about that actually. I feel that you  and Kasumi have progressed far beyond my expectations and faster than I thought  possible. I had decided that we would have gone to China  to continue training but the remarkable skill you two have shown lately makes  it unnecessary. When Trent called  me a few weeks ago, he told me of a job in law enforcement in some place called  Chicago. Since the gun laws are  less strict in America,  I also figure that moving there will help the three of us keep up our handgun  skills. We can't go traipsing off to a military base every time we want to fire  off a few rounds you know."</p><p>When she heard about law enforcement, Kasumi's interest was  piqued. Maybe if she became a detective, she could find out what had happened  to her family all those years ago. Living in Nerima had become a bit of a  struggle lately. The few memories that she still had of her father and sisters,  sometimes brought her to tears, especially when she wandered and found herself  at the sight of the dojo, now a housing development. What kind of name is  Maison Ikkoku anyway? The last Tendo wanted the chance for her heart to heal,  and moving away sounded like the best idea. Revenge, of course, would come  later.</p><p>The move was uneventful and the Saotomes and Kasumi found Chicago  to be a refreshing change to the staid prefecture. Genma almost went back to  his old weight when he discovered deep dish pizza and restaurants like The  Chicago Chop House. Luckily the diet his wife had put him on years ago and his  somewhat active lifestyle put his metabolism on par with his son's. Even Kasumi  had been known to scarf down hefty meals at her favorite Italian restaurant, Lido's.  Of course, her natural grace and charm made it seem like she was eating in a  dignified manner, despite the size of the meals themselves.</p><p>Kasumi's and Ranma's relationship had progressed to the  point where they felt they no longer needed to <i>'sneak around'</i> as it were. When they revealed what they had been  sharing all this time to Ranma's parents, minus any graphic details, they were  stunned that the two elder Saotomes already knew. Nodoka told them that she  knew once they returned from the Nagasaki  trip. "A mother can always tell," she said. Genma found out later by  accidentally walking in on them while they were busy a couple of years later  and just left quietly, so as not to disturb them. With Ranma being a somewhat  genius, no one knew that a life altering choice like moving to another country  would reveal that, he was able to be in the same school as Kasumi. Thanks to  years of training, he looked somewhat older than his actual age, that being  three years Kasumi's junior. The both of them made quite a stir in school.  Everyone thought them to be the perfect couple and it showed. However, once  graduation rolled around, things didn't stay that way. Ranma's wanderlust  reared its ugly head and Kasumi decided to join the police academy. Though they  didn't part with harsh words but actually an intense night of passion, it was  plain to see that they were no longer an item.</p><p>Kasumi soon realized she had found her niche, one of many to  be truthful. The skills she showed at the academy powered her through the  school and landed her a job right off the bat with the Chicago P.D., something  she was immensely proud of. If Ranma had still been there, she would have shown  him how happy she was, but thoughts like that caused a small ache in her heart.  A few months before they moved away, the Saotomes, along with their new  daughter Keiko, took Kasumi out to celebrate. It helped ease the ache somewhat,  but not much. After they moved away, Kasumi slowly rose to the rank of  lieutenant. She was instrumental in the arrest and conviction of many dangerous  criminals during her early years on the force. She soon gained the attention of  the higher-ups and was offered a plum assignment on an elite Special Forces  team. Even though it would mean moving to a new town, she accepted the offer.</p><p>The day she met her new teammates was an interesting one to  be sure. She didn't expect to see a familiar face as she walked into the  office.</p><p>"Uncle Genma? Is that you?"</p><p>Genma looked up from his desk and recognized who she was  right away. "<i>Kasumi!</i> How good to see  you. Come here and give me a hug." The now burly man with a slight graying in  his beard and at the temples stood and opened his arms which Kasumi filled  right away. Slipping into Japanese, Genma asked, "So how have you been  Kasumi-chan? No-chan and I haven't heard from you in a while and Keiko was  wondering about her auntie. What's been going on?" Replying in kind while  finishing the hug and stepping back, Kasumi told Genma of what had happened to  her since her last letter to them and asked about Ranma. He told her that they  hadn't heard from him in a while and assumed that the two of them had gotten  back together. Kasumi was a little saddened by this news but pushed it aside  for the time being. A clearing of a throat behind her caused them both to focus  their attention on the new arrival.</p><p>"So Genma, who's this? Are you seeing someone behind  Nodoka's back? I must admit, she's…" "<i>Don't</i>  finish that thought Brad or you'll be spitting teeth." The brown haired man's  eyes widened slightly in shock at that statement. "This is my niece Kasumi.  Kasumi, meet Brad Vickers. He's one of the pilots for the team." Sticking out  her hand, Kasumi said, "Nice to meet you Brad. Thank you for the almost  compliment." "Uh, no problem. Nice to meet you too. If you'll excuse me, I'll  be over by the communications console." After shaking her hand, he wandered  off. Turning around again, Kasumi gave Genma an inquiring glance. Genma told  her of Brad's somewhat rotten reputation with women and of his nickname <i>'Chicken Heart.'</i> He then explained that  Brad was somewhat of a coward, but the best helicopter pilot and mechanic they  had. Before they could continue their exchange, a new voice interrupted them.</p><p>"Hey Genma, who's this? Don't tell me you have another  daughter that you didn't tell anyone about. Hi, I'm Chris Redfield. And you  are?" On first glance, Kasumi wasn't impressed in the least. Chris seemed to be  an average looking man, slightly muscular and carried himself like a boxer.  Having known Ranma ruined all other men for her because she knew they would  never measure up to him. She figured that Chris would be a good friend and  someone she might be able to trust someday, so she thought she should make a  good first impression. "I'm Kasumi Tendo. It's a pleasure to meet you. Genma is  actually my uncle, but not by blood or marriage. It's a Japanese thing." With a  slight look of confusion, Chris finished shaking Kasumi's hand and welcomed her  to the team. He then sat at his desk to go over a case file there.</p><p>Before she could turn around again, a third person entered  the room. This man was by far the strangest she had ever seen. Dressed in what  seemed to be the standard uniform for the group, it was militarily sharp. His  blond hair was styled in a severe buzz cut which seemed to defy gravity by  sticking straight up. The fact that he was wearing sunglasses indoors wasn't  lost on Kasumi either. <i>'What type of fool  wears sunglasses indoors? He must be trying to compensate for a distinct </i>lack<i> of something if he thinks that makes him  look cool. Who's he trying to impress anyway?'</i> Kasumi's internal dialogue  was interrupted when the man stepped up to her and Genma. Taking the reigns of  conversation, Genma made the introductions. "Kasumi, meet Albert Wesker. He's  the captain. Captain Wesker, meet Kasumi Tendo, my niece."</p><p>"You're Captain Wesker? Then I guess I need to give you  this." Reaching behind herself, Kasumi pulled out a manila envelope and handed  it to the blond-haired man who had yet to say anything. Opening the envelope,  he then skimmed over the papers inside before looking back to her. Opening his  mouth, he spoke the words that would forever seal her fate. "Well, it seems  everything is in order. Welcome to the Special Tactics and Rescue Squad Alpha  Team, also known as S.T.A.R.S. Alpha. I hope you'll enjoy living here in Raccoon   City."</p><p>Author's Notes:</p><p>I've finally finished this damn thing. And here it usually  takes me less time to write a 'Scenes from Nerima' fic. Go figure. Of course, I  own none of the characters here, not even Trent.  For those of you that have read the novelizations of the games by S.D. Perry,  you would know who he is. It's been a while since I've played the games and  read the books, so the time frames may seem skewed. That and I plan to wreak  havoc on the Resident Evil world. [Insert evil boisterous laugh here] ahem My  bad. Anywho, it might be a while before my next chapter comes out, or at least  the first one since this is the prologue. Where I'll be steering this fic, only  my muse knows for sure and she ain't telling.</p><p>As always, reviews are appreciated. It's nice to be  acknowledged. Ranma won't be making an appearance for a while though so don't  expect him to just show up right off the bat. This is my first attempt at a  fusion fic of sorts. With Kasumi playing the role of Jill Valentine and Genma  filling Barry Burton's shoes, it makes you wonder who else from the Ranmaverse  will be taking over somebody's life. Just to make something perfectly clear,  Kuno will not be Alfred Ashford. That guy is loony enough. Shampoo will also not  be Ada Wong. I have someone else in mind for her. Of course, I'm not telling  who I mean. As always, remember my motto, "My fic, my rules." See you in the  funny papers.</p>
