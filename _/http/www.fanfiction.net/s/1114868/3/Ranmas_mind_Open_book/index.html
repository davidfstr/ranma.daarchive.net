</div>I don't own dis', Rumiko Takahashi own dis'<p>-<br/>Chapter 3 - it's getting even more lemon, you've been warned.<p>Onna-Ranma is tied naked to a bed as Akane wearing leather boots and gloves and a studded collar approaches seductively holding a whip and wearing an enormous phallic object strapped to her pelvis, Ranma is terrified at the sight of the huge object, easily a foot in length and 3 inches wide.<p>"a-Akane, no, stay away from me, please, no!"<p>"Ranma, what's wrong, don't you love me?"<p>"It's not that I just.."<p>"Then you won't mind if I enjoy your body, will you?" she asks as she slides across the naked girl's body, she pauses to lick Ranma's nipples, they stiffen in excitement,<p>"Mmmm, ah, wait, please don't stick that thing in me, Mmmm" Ranma pleads<p>"What's that, you want me to stick it in?"<p>"No!" Ranma screams,<p>Akane presses the end of the enormous phallic object against the moist lips of Ranma's pussy.<p>"No Akane, don't!"<p>Ignoring Ranma's protests, Akane gives a strong thrust and buries the entire length inside Ranma's depths.<p>"AAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGE!" Ranma yells as he awakens from the bizarre nightmare,<p>The scream awakens Akane from her peaceful slumber, she sits up in bed and thinks about the pleasant dream she was having.<br/>*Damn, and I was having such a nice dream too, Ranma was tied to a bed naked and I was going to fuck her with an obscenely large strap-on dildo* then she realizes<br/>*Oh I'm such a sick pervert*<p>She then begins to hear Ranma's thoughts again.<p>"Aw man that was the weirdest dream I ever had, like Akane would ever try and stick something that huge up my, erm, thing, she knows I'm really a guy so she wouldn't ah, do that, to me, right?*<p>It is then that Akane realizes they now share dreams aswell.<p>*Another thing to have fun with* she thinks with a grin on her face.<p>-<p>The day begins with Ranma and Genma sparring outside as usual.<p>"You're not focused boy!" Genma yells between blows,<p>"shut up old man!"<p>Ranma launches an aerial attack on his father raining down a hundred blows in a matter of seconds, Genma manages to block most of them but takes a hit in the solar plexus and gets badly winded, then Ranma leaps at his father with his foot outstretched for a fly kick, Genma mysteriously recovers and jumps in the air and in one motion blocks Ranma's kick and manages to plant a foot against his sons face, Ranma continues moving forward with momentum while spinning around and lands in the koi pond, Ranma then pulls herself out of the pond with an angry look on her face.<p>"Hey you tricked me by pretending to be hurt"<p>"Ranma when will you learn that deception is a key element of the anything goes style of martial arts"<p>"That's it, anything goes school of martial arts secret technique, HAPPO 50 YEN SATSU!"<p>"What! You never learned that technique!"<p>As Ranma begins to draw a large circle with the 50 yen piece she seems to fumble with the coin.<p>"Oh I seem to have dropped the 50 yen coin I was going to use"<p>"It's mine!"<p>As Genma dives for the fallen piece of silver his path is obstructed by a knee, which collides with his head and knocks him into the pond.<p>"Geez pop, you're one to talk, gullible fool"<p>"Growf" [That was a dirty trick]<p>-<p>Ranma walks inside for breakfast and sits next to Akane, who scoots over to get a bit closer.<p>"So Ranma, hows was the date late night?" asked Nabiki,<p>"Huh, oh yeah it was, um, real good" she said blushing,<br/>*Akane and I were making out practically all the way through it*<p>"Oh? and what was the movie like?"<p>"Yeah, the movie was great, lots of fighting and stuff"<br/>*I have no idea*<p>"well I'm glad you had such a good time" Nabiki says and then winks at the redhead<p>Akane begins to feel Ranma's thigh with her hand under the table and Ranma starts to get nervous.<p>*What's Akane doing? The whole family is watching*<p>Ranma leans over and whispers in the other girls ear.<p>"Hey, quit it would ya"<p>Ranma grabs Akane's hand and places it in the other girls lap and begins eating, but Akane moves it back to where it was, and moves her hand to Ranma's inner thigh and is slowly creeping upwards...<p>"k-Kasumi, ah, c-could you please get me some hot water" Ranma says nervously,<p>"certainly Ranma-chan, I'll be right back" says Kasumi as she leaves the room to get some hot water.<p>*Akane's getting all touchy feelly, especially when I'm a girl, it's making me nervous, I'd rather not be a girl around her if I can help it*<p>Akane draws her hand away feeling a little hurt at Ranma's thought's.<p>*He thinks I'm a pervert*<p>Kasumi returns and pours hot water over Ranma.<p>"Thanks Kasumi" says the now male Ranma,<p>*Maybe it's just that weird dream that's making me nervous, I don't mind being a girl with Akane, but I'd rather she keep her hands off till we're, in private I guess, heh heh*<p>Akane smiles and starts eating.<p>-<p>Akane enters the dojo and watches while Ranma goes through some Kata's, she can feel his movement, his concentration, and she decides to test something out.<p>"Ranma, will you spar against me?"<p>"You know I don't hit girls Akane"<p>"You don't have to, you can just dodge like you always do, but don't blame me if you get hurt coz you won't fight back"<br/>*I can read all your moves Ranma, you don't stand a chance*<p>"Alright Akane, come at me"<br/>*she seems awfully confident all of a sudden*<p>Akane starts running towards where Ranma is standing and yells as she throws a fist, as usual Ranma dodges, but this time, Akane senses his intended path a split second before he moves and she strikes out where he will be before he gets there, he stops to see a fist coming at him, again he dodges, just barely by flipping over Akane, however, Akane does not sense him above her, rather she senses herself below him, as if from Ranma's perspective, Akane lashes out with spinning kick, as Ranma lands behind her, her foot connects with his right side, Ranma then staggers about and gets in a ready stance.<p>"Akane, how'd you get so good all of a sudden?"<br/>*How the hell is she reading my moves so quick, she's never been this fast*<p>"Wouldn't you like to know"<p>"I just asked didn't I, c'mon, come at me again, this time I'm ready for ya"<p>"Alright Ranma, here I come"<p>Akane once again charges at Ranma wildly throwing fists, this time Ranma stands his ground blocking rather than dodging, not giving Akane a chance to catch him off guard, though she seems to be giving him a run for his money, Akane can no longer hears his thoughts though, however, she instinctively knows where to strike and counter his moves, (this is mind reading on a sub-conscious level folks), however, although she knows how to counter his moves, she is not physically capable of reacting fast enough, suddenly Ranma stops blocking and leans backwards to avoid Akane's fist, Akane goes slightly off balance and Ranma uses this to his advantage, he moves forward and in one motion catches her arm underneath his, and leans his body forward pulling Akane onto his back, he then leaps high in the air with Akane on his back and then contorts his body so that Akane lands on her back with him ontop, sortof like a Wrestling suplex, the entire weight of Ranma's body has smashed Akane into the ground, this all happens within mere seconds. Ranma pry's himself off the barely conscious Akane and helps her to her feet.<p>"Hey Akane, sorry for being so rough, how'd you improve so fast anyways? I haven't seen you training that much"<p>"Uh, Ouch, you're heavy Ranma, that really hurt, anyway, you took me more seriously this time, you actually put some damage on me" she says still in a daze,<p>"Hey, I don't hit girls, I didn't say nuthin about body slammin em'"<br/>*oh man how stupid am I! Body slam! That must've sounded totally perverted*<p>"Hey Ranma, you can body slam me any time, as long as you're gentle" she says stroking his face<p>"Uh..." Ranma gets nervous and starts blushing when he hears her say this, then Akane draws her hand back and makes it into a fist and punches him square in the face, Ranma collapses on the ground gushing blood everywhere,<p>"Geez Ranma, you're so stupid, I can't believe you fell for that" Akane says and starts giggling as she staggers out of the dojo, still sore from Ranma's suplex move.<p>-<p>It's about lunch time and Ranma and Akane are walking to Uchan's to get some Okonomiyaki, on the way they begin to hear a rumbling sound, somewhat like an earthquake, they turn around to see a large dust cloud, at the front of which, is Happosai.<p>"What a haul, what a haul!" he yells with glee,<p>"Gets back here you dirty old man!"<br/>"Give me back my underwear! That was my last pair!"<br/>"You'll pay for this you pervert!"<p>"Awe man it's the freak pillaging panties again" Ranma grumbled,<br/>*For an old guy he sure does have a lot of stamina to out run all those angry women, I think the chase is part of the fun for him, well, too bad the chase is about to end*<p>Ranma leaps out infront of the hoard and extends his leg out to intercept the diminutive old pervert, but Happosai grabs Ranma's foot and hauls himself onto of his leg and runs along it, and then drops some of his prized undergarments on Ranma's head before leaping away.<p>"There you go Ranma, it's a parting gift for your assistance!" The old man yelled as he jumped towards more exposed underwear hanging outside balconies, of course, by assistance, he meant unwittingly diverting attention away from himself,<p>"Hey, that guy has some of our underwear, he must be teaming up with the old man!"<p>"No wait, it's not what you think! I have no interest in stealing womens underwear at all!"<p>They completely ignore his pleads of innocence and commence pummeling the pigtailed boy. Afterwards Akane helps him to his feet and they continue walking.<p>"Are you okay Ranma"<p>"Sure, I've had worse beatings than that" he said dusting himself off,<br/>*That old goat, using me as a diversion, he's always using me for somethin, man, with a master like him I have no need for enemies. But then, without enemies like him, life wouldn't be a constant struggle, I'd have no reason to get stronger, like the Hiryu Shoten Ha, I would've never learnt that technique if Happosai hadn't hit that weakness point, and there are other adversaries, most of which are somehow connected to Jusenkyo, Tarou, Ryoga, Mouse, cologne, my curse and the circumstances that surround it have led me to these people, and I've had to become far stronger because of it, it really is ironic that to become strong, I first had to become weak, maybe it's that yin yang stuff.<br/>"Akane"<p>"Yes Ranma?"<p>"I got a hypothetical question for ya, suppose you could choose between me, and another Ranma from a parallel universe that was exactly like me in every possible way, except that this other Ranma was weaker than me, but didn't have a Jusenkyo curse, who would you pick?"<p>"Well that's simple, I'd pick the one who was the most happy"<p>"Huh?"<p>"I'd pick the one who accept's himself, and loves himself for who he is, because Ranma, you can't expect anyone else to accept you and love you if you can't first accept and love yourself, and also, have you ever thought that if it wasn't for your curse, we might not even be engaged, remember when we first met?"<p>"Yeah"<br/>*You wanted to be my friend and as soon as you found out I was a guy you pushed me away, and it hurt*<p>"I'm...I'm sorry for how I first reacted to your curse, I...I was selfish back then, I didn't take your feelings into consideration, but if it wasn't for your curse, you might've ended up with either of my sisters, you remember how they pushed me into being your fiance, I don't think either of them wanted to marry a man who was a girl half the time, and back then I hated boys, so if you didn't have a curse, you'd most probably be engaged to Nabiki or maybe even Kasumi, did you ever think of that?"<p>"Hey, I guess you're right, I owe a lot to my curse, and not just my strength"<br/>*I'd take you over a cure anyday, hmm, how'd Akane get so smart about relationships anyway, I never new she understood me so well*<p>*Ooooh, I'm so glad I bought that 'how to improve your relationship' guide from the bookstore after school yesterday, now to see if I can remember all the main points, 1. trust 2. communication 3. understanding 4. don't hide feelings and 5. learn to cook! I made up the last one but it really is necessary*<p>*Akane has changed so much in the last couple of days, she's still as fiery as ever, but now she's blossoming into a woman, I love her even more than before, if only I could tell her, I will soon, but I'll wait till the right moment*<p>Akane starts to blush furiously.<p>*He loves me!*<p>They near Uchan's and walk inside, Ranma enters first followed by Akane.<p>"Oh hello Ranchan! Hi Akane" she greets Akane a little less cheerfully when she enters,<p>"Hello Ukyo" Akane says as she sits down<p>"Hey Uchan, so hows things?" Ranma asks in a friendly manner,<p>"Oh just fine Ranchan, business is good, even without my number 1 waitress"<p>"Heh, y'know me, yo Akane what sortof Okonomiyaki you want?"<p>"Um, pork please"<br/>*Hmm, lets see how Ukyo reacts if I move a little closer to 'Ranchan'*<p>Akane shifts her seat over to be closer to Ranma, Ukyo is visibly upset at the display of affection though Ranma doesn't notice.<p>"Umm, Ukyo, I'll pay for Akane's okay" Ranma says<p>"Oh no that's fine Ranchan, you don't have to pay for what Akane eats, it's on the house sugar"<p>"Thanks Uchan, you're a real pal y'know that" Ranma says as a plate of Okonomiaki is placed infront of him and he starts eating,<p>*Hmm, Ranma really does see Ukyo as just a friend, I feel kinda sorry for her, I shouldn't tease her by being so affectionate to Ranma in front of her* Akane thinks as she shifts her seat away from Ranma slightly.<p>Ukyo puts a plate of Okonomiaki infront of Akane and looks her in the eyes with that 'hands off my Ranchan' glare, Akane simply looks back at her Okonomiaki, on it reads 'hands off my Ranchan' Akane seems not to notice and starts eating it.<p>-<p>After lunch Ranma and Akane head in separate directions, Akane goes by train to the inner city to go shopping while Ranma goes home to 'study'. Akane is walking past a row of shops when she notices one which catches her interest, the sign above the store says 'sex toys 'R' us' Akane hesitates to enter, first glancing around to make sure no one is watching, then she quickly slips into the store.<p>-<p>Meanwhile, Ranma has gone to the Nekohanten to talk to Cologne, however he gets stopped by Mousse on the way there.<p>"Ranma Saotome!"<p>"Hey Mousse hows it hangin man, lemme guess you wanna fight me over Shampoo right?"<p>"Ranma, I heard about what you and Akane did you Shampoo at the movie theatre last night, how dare you lay a finger on my precious Shampoo, you vile enemy of women!"<p>"Hey Mousse, if anyone should be sympathetic to the fairer sex it'd be me, how could I be an enemy to women if I _was_ a woman nearly the whole night?"<p>"Enough with your excuses and fight me!" Mousse yelled as he launched himself in the air raining down chained weapons at Ranma.<br/>Ranma simply side stepped to dodge the barrage of chains and casually grabbed one that was still protruding from Mousses bottomless sleeve and yanked on it swiftly bringing the blind Amazon flying toward the ground.<p>"I won't go down that easy!" Mousse yelled just as he descended on Ranma who brought a roaring uppercut toward the other body, which he deflected with a... duck shaped training potty.<p>"Awe man not this lame shit again" Ranma complained,<p>"Don't take me lightly Ranma!" Mousse yelled as again he threw numerous objects on chains flying out of his sleeves, as he did so Ranma circled around him getting closer while ducking and weaving through the chained projectiles, somehow in Mousse's vain attempts at scoring a blow against Ranma he managed to get his chains somewhat tangled, Ranma used this moment to rush in and beat Mousse senseless, Ranma stood next to the fallen Amazon and offered his hand to help the other boy to his feet, Mousse smacked it aside and painfully stood up by himself.<p>"Look Mousse, there aint no point in tryin to beat me, y'ain't never guna win, and anyway, I'm sorry about Shampoo, but that was Akane who knocked her out, you know how that voilent tomboy gets"<p>"Shut up Ranma, I suppose next you'll be saying you have no interest in Shampoo right?"<p>"Well, now that you mention it she is kinda cute, maybe I'll add her to my list of conquests hmm" Mousse is visibly fuming after this comment, " Hey I was just kidding man relax, no I don't got no interest in Shampoo alright"<p>"Then why do you keep her from me Saotome, do you just get some sadistic pleasure from crushing my chances with Shampoo?"<p>"It's not me who's keepin ya apart, it's that stupid Amazon law thingy, hmph, look I could talk all day but the fact is I have some important business to attend to with the old crone alright" Ranma say as he leaps in the dirrection of the Nekohanten. Mousse regains his composure and retreives the Ramen from where he left it and continued on his delivery.<p>"Ranma, I swear that one day I will defeat you and take Shampoo as my rightful bride"<p>-<p>Ranma enters the Nekohanten and walks over to where Cologne is behind the counter.<p>"Why hello future son in law, I'm afraid you can't see Shampoo right now, she has a migraine you see"<p>"Ah, heh heh, that would be Akane's doing, ah, sorry but I didn't come to see Shampoo, I came to see you actually"<p>"Oh, and why would that be future son in law?"<p>"Well, I was wondering if you might share something with me?"<p>"And what would that be?"<p>"Well, future mother in law *cringe* I'm not very experienced with women you see, and I was wondering if there were any secret erm, 'pressure points' which could be used to give, erm, pleasure, umm, I mean when Shampoo and I y'know, do it, I just wanna be good at it y'know"<br/>*Ah man, she doesn't believe of word of this crap, I was really laying it on thick with that mother in law stuff, I'm so transparent*<p>"Well son in law, I never expected you ask something like that, there are many pressure points on the human body which can make a person, how should I put this, more responsive, so you want to be able to please Shampoo, very well then, I will lend you the scrolls with the techniques you request"<p>"Thank you very much future mother in law" Ranma said politely as he bowed to the diminutive Matriarch,<p>"Don't mention it future son in law, you'll make Shampoo very happy" she said as she winked at him<p>Ranma then hastily left the Nekohanten with the scrolls he needed and went back to the Tendo residence.<p>-<p>Akane exits the sex shop with her face beet red.<p>*So that's what they meant by 'toys' how did that clerk manage to sell me all this stuff, as soon as I get home I have to find a place to hide all of this*<p>Akane notices that she hasn't been able to hear Ranma's thoughts for quite some time.<p>*Hmm, must be out of range* She thinks as she makes her way back to the train station.<p>-<p>Ranma is sitting in her room naked with scrolls sprawled over the floor one of which is open to a diagram depicting various pressure points.<p>*Akane's in town, Kasumi is out buying groceries, Nabiki's gone debt collecting, and Tendo and pop are out somewhere, that leaves me all alone to figure out these pressure points, I've already figured out all the 'erogenous' zones on a womans body, and have them well documented* she thinks as she flips through a notebook which is half full with detailed techniques for pleasuring a womans body.<p>"Man, this looks difficult, I gotta hit 3 places at once, I guess I can use these acupuncture needles, ok I put one here, and one here" Ranma is talking to herself as she places acupuncture needles in various places.<br/>"and then I hit this spot above my pelvis with my finger and.." as Ranma hits that magical point her body starts to become incredibly aroused, and Ranma almost compulsively starts fondling herself.<br/>"Mmmm, ah, wait, gotta read on..must..find..Mmmmmm..counter point" as Ranma says this to herself she reaches her hand out to find the passage on the scroll which tells how to counter the arousal point, however before she reaches it she feels the compulsion to alleviate the itching urge between her legs.<p>-<p>Meanwhile a certain perverted old being watches the events unfold on his television.<p>"Ah now this shows finally starting to get good, lets see how the other one is going" he says as he picks up the remote to change channels to see a certain someone riding the train home.<br/>"Awe this show aint no good, perhaps if I push this button" he pushes another button on the remote and waits to see the result.<p>-<p>Akane is still riding the train when suddenly she comes within range of Ranma's thoughts again, and the sensation hits her like a bus.<p>*Ah! Mmmm, I think I'm having some sortof sensory overload! WHERE'S THAT GODDAMN COUNTER POINT! Ah screw it, I'll get myself off first so I can think straight*<p>Akane starts to squirm in her seat when she suddenly becomes aroused and begins to feel the sensations that Ranma is giving her own body. She holds on to the seat to try and control herself and fight the urge to gratify herself, a short moan escapes her lips gaining the attention of all the male passengers, who watch as she shakes uncontrolably while rubbing her thighs together.<p>*Ah! Ranma you BAKA! Mmmm, not now! Please stop*<p>The train comes to a stop and she rushes out to find the nearest public toilet, the seat she was using is left a bit damp.<p>-<p>"AH! AH! Mmmmmm!" Ranma moans as she carresses her pussy, while her other hand fondles her left breast, she feels the pressure building in her loins and then suddenly her body starts convulsing as she orgasms, leaving a small pool of juices just underneath her, she lifts her fingers in front of her face and inspects them.<p>*Eww, smells funny, I should see what it tastes like, for when I erm, do it with Akane*<p>Ranma inserts her sticky didgets in her mouth and coils her tounge around them licking of all of the sticky substance.<p>*hmm, it's not so bad, oh no, it's starting again* she thinks as her body starts to become arroused again.<p>"Oh no, not this time" She says as she picks up the accupuncture needles, she quicky reads the scroll and tends to the various pressure points.<p>"whew, I'd better clean this up and take a bath"<p>-<br/>Whew, I can't be bothered writing anymore, unless everyone who reviews it says they really really really like it.<br/>-
