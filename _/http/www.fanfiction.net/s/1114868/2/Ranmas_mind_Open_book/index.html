</div>*I don't own dis', Rumiko Takahashi own dis'*<p>* = thoughts so j00 not get conf00zed.<p>-<p>Ranma's mind open book chapter 2<p>-<p>Authors notes.<p>Yo, this is my first fic and it has been noted that the first chapter underwent some changes, it's not that I'm trying to please everyones tastes with this fic, with the 3rd rewrite having Ryoga attempt homicide instead of suicide, I just really disliked the direction I pointed it in, this was spose to be funny dammit, and I realized that yes, Ryoga was way out of character, and Akane is too, but in a funny way, so it's good, I'm not trying to write a Hamlet/Ranma crossover here so that's why I changed it, and now that I've hit my stride there will be less mid-story changes to annoy people, and also the main reason Akane is acting different is that she's extremely insecure about herself, she's got like an inferiority complex with Ranma's other fiance's but now that she KNOWS he's got it for her bad, she's more confident and forth coming y'know, well enjoy chapter 2 anyway.<br/>-Luke-<p>-<p>"Akane! Hurry up or we'll be late to the movie!" yelled Ranma from downstairs<br/>*Man it never took me this long to get ready as a girl, she's got no excuse*<br/>"C'mon! I'm dyin of boredom down here!"<p>Akane makes her way down the stairs wearing a mid-length plaid skirt, tight blue blouse and an overcoat, sexy yet modest.<br/>"Honestly Ranma you have no patience at all, so how do I look"<p>"Umm, you look fine lets go" he says nervously,<br/>*SEXY!* is the one word that come to his mind,<p>Akane smiles coyly at Ranma,<br/>*That'll teach you to call me uncute you pervert* she thinks<br/>"Stop staring and lets go Ranma, you're the one who was complaining that we'd be late"<p>Ranma's mind begins to function again and they walk out of the house and head in the direction of the local cinema, Genma and Soun watch on with hopeful expressions, they then turn back to their shoji board.<p>"Saotome, could it be that those two have finally started getting along?"<p>"Tendo, I think that the future of the Saotome and Tendo schools of anything goes martial arts are secure"<p>"That they are Saotome, oh look they're fighting again (points in the general direction they were walking)<p>"What, I don't see anything (looks back at the board) Oh! It seems you have the advantage Tendo, but nonetheless I do plan on.. what's that! (more pieces magically vanish)<p>"What, what is it?" Asks Tendo as the ritual cheating continues.<p>-<p>Shampoo watches Ranma and Akane walk hand in hand down the road along side the canal from a nearby rooftop, she appears quite agitated.<p>"Violent pervert girl no steal Shampoo airen, Shampoo make sure of that" she says to herself as she stealthily moves with catlike grace from one rooftop to another so as to keep the pair in view. She keeps tailing them till they arrive at the cinema.<p>*Hmm, kinda get the feeling someones following us, wouldn't surprise me with the number of people trying to keep me and Akane apart* Ranma thinks to himself, seemingly acquiring a sixth sense of his own, he ignores the nagging feeling in his gut and reluctantly enters the cinema. He pays for the tickets, buys snacks and drink and goes into the cinema and sits next to Akane. Almost as soon as the movie starts his mind begins to wander.<p>*hmm, just yesterday Akane and me were at each others throat, now our relationship is the best it's ever been, Akane's been so nice to me recently, it almost seems like she's a different person, she hasn't hit me once all day or yelled at me or tried to feed me bad food or nuthin*<p>Akane winces at the food comment but quickly eases violent urges. At that moment Ranma sees something peculiar, a man pretending to yawn and then place his arm around the girl next to him as if that was simply where it was meant to go, Ranma considers this carefully.<p>*Hmm, Akane's been real nice and she's been flirting with me a lot recently so I guess I can put my arm around her, she won't mind, right* He continues to ponder this as he takes a sip of his soda, a fat man chose that exact moment to barge through to try and make a hasty exit to the toilet, causing Ranma to spill his soft drink all over himself, turning him into a wet, sticky, and very annoyed redhead.<p>*Great, the soft drink is making my shirt stick against my chest, this is really uncomfortable* she grouses mentally over the situation,<br/>"I'm really sorry Akane, I know you wanted to go on a date with me as a guy"<p>"That's okay Ranma, I'm not worried about what you look like, why don't you just go to the restroom and clean yourself up a bit?"<p>"Okay Akane, I'll be right back okay"<br/>*maybe I'll get lucky and the restroom with have hot water* she thought hopefully<p>No such luck unfortunately, Ranma wet her shirt with water from the sink and then dried her chest under the hand drier, then went back into the theatre and returned to her seat next to Akane.<p>"Hey, I'm back, what happened while I was away?"<p>"That guy played by Jet Lee went to this other dimension so he could kill himself, I don't get why but the martial arts in this is pretty cool"<p>*What a dumb plot, but as long as it has fighting in it..*<p>Ranma witnesses another stealth yawn/shoulder hug and returns to her previous thought.<p>*there ain't no way Akane's guna want me to put my arm around her now, not with me as a girl, I mean what would people think right (looks over at Akane) but then again, who cares what other people think*<p>Ranma then begins the fake yawn tactic she had seen performed twice now, and mid yawn considered simply putting her arms back down at her sides, but Akane grabbed Ranma's arm before she could put it back down and pulled it around her shoulder and affectionately cuddled against the redhead.<p>"um, Akane" Ranma said looking the other girl in the eyes,<p>"Ranma, don't ever hesitate to show me how you feel (she turns her head back towards the screen) anyway, I kinda like you this way Ranma"<p>*Eep, she likes me this way! she really does hate boys!*<p>Akane couldn't help but giggle at that last comment.<p>Shampoo is watching the two from the back row planning her course of action.<p>*violent pervert girl try seduce girl type Ranma, Shampoo no can allow that* thinks the voluptuous Amazon,<p>Shampoo chooses that exact moment to make her move, she takes a water pistol out of her bag and sprays Ranma with it.<p>"What the hell, who did that! eww this stuff smells like sardines" exclaimed the redhead as she stood up angrily, as she did so Shampoo pulled a starving alley cat out of her bag and threw it at the sardine smelling girl.<p>"Arge! c-c-CAT!" Ranma yelled as she leapt into the air to avoid the feline hellspawn, when she fell back down she tumbled over several rows of seats before landing in a mans lap,<p>"Hey there young lady why don't you get comfortable, I'll protect you from that nasty cat" he said while groping the frightened redhead, who's eyes suddenly went red with fury,<p>"YUCK! Stop touching me you ugly disgusting freak!" she said continuously punching him in the face making him even more ugly,<p>The alley cat once more made a wild leap towards the furious redhead who suddenly turned white with fear again, she then jumped up and ran through the rows of seats in a mad dash and then tripped landing in someone elses lap, this time it was an attractive woman in her mid 30's,<p>"Oh my are you alright dear? she asked calmly, Ranma noticed her good looks and blushed before speaking,<p>"Ah, um, g - gomen" she uttered, then stood and ran out of the cinema followed by the ravenous feline hellspawn,<p>*Aiyah! Now Shampoo save Ranma from bad kitty!* Shampoo thought to herself happily,<p>*Meeeeeoooow* the cat growled hungrily as it approached the redhead, and just before it pounced a large mace like weapon impacted the poor ravenous hellspawn, leaving it twitching on the floor.<p>"Aiyah! Shampoo save airen from bad kitty!" Shampoo gleefully exclaimed jumping into the shorter girls arms and glomping onto her with all her strength, Shampoo then started to rub herself up and down against Ranma's body trying to incite a response, "Airen give Shampoo reward for saving from bad kitty yes?"<p>"Ah, Sh-Shampoo I'm sorta with someone y'know I *MMPH*" Ranma is cut off mid-sentence by Shampoo's sudden (french) kiss<br/>"*Mmm*Ah! *gasp*(catches breath) Shampoo why'd you do that!"<p>"RANMA! What're you doing with Shampoo!"<p>*Oh shit she saw!*<br/>"Akane it ain't what it looks like really!" Ranma says while making 'don't hit me' gestures with her hands<p>"Oh Ranma you is too aggressive, Shampoo no expect sudden kiss from airen" says Shampoo still clinging to the shorter girl<p>Akane starts walking towards them and then 'materializes' a huge mallet from nothing.<p>*Oh man, I guess going a whole day without Akane hitting me was asking too much, oh well, I shall resign to my fate, the pain with fade soon enough* Ranma thinks as she closes her eyes readying herself for the pain that will surely come.<p>*WHAM*<p>Ranma opens her eyes to see an irate Akane standing over Shampoo's limp form on the ground.<p>"Stupid Chinese slut! Hands off my man! um, woman, whatever!" Akane yells, though Shampoo isn't likely to hear it, Akane then grabs Ranma by the arm and drags her out of the lobby and back into the movie theatre.<p>"Hey Akane, sure we should just leave her there?"<p>"Someone will come take care of her Ranma, c'mon we have a movie to watch!" Akane is visibly upset,<br/>*Can't even have a normal date with my fiance without someone showing up to ruin it! and she had the nerve to kiss him, and right in front of me no less!*<p>"Um, Akane" Ranma says as they're heading towards the cinema,<p>"What!"<p>"Ah, Aren't you guna hit me, I mean, coz of what just happened with me and Shampoo?"<p>Akane's temper gets the better of her and she turns around and punches Ranma in the face, Ranma's head moves to the side a bit but she doesn't show any sign of pain, just a hurt look in her eyes. Akane looks at her fist against Ranma's face and pulls it away as she begins to cry.<p>"Akane? What's wrong?" Ranma asks<p>"I'm sorry I hit you Ranma, I just can't control myself sometimes" she says sadly,<p>"Hey, you did a better job of controlling yourself than usual, compared to the beatings I usually get that was just a little slap, c'mon, it's okay Akane, don't cry" Ranma says as she comforts the raven haired girl<br/>"C'mon Akane, I actually kinda deserved it, I didn't try to avoid it enough"<br/>*Like the time that asshole Mikado kissed me, yeauch!*<p>Akane giggles as she wipes away her tears.<p>"Hey what's so funny Akane?"<p>"Nothing Ranma, lets just go watch the movie okay"<p>"Okay"<p>They walk back to their seats and Ranma puts her arm back around Akane's shoulder, and Akane once again snuggles up against Ranma as they watch Jet Lee pummel the crap out of himself.<p>*Hmm, that kiss Shampoo gave me, I'm ashamed to admit, felt really good, especially the way her tongue moved in my mouth, if Akane knew that I sortof kissed back, she'd be furious, but I couldn't help it, Shampoo is no doubt sexy, she's well endowed and voluptuous to say the least, oh man, I shouldn't think about this stuff, not while I'm with Akane*<p>Though Ranma can't see the expression on Akane's face from where she rests against her, she radiates barely contained fury.<p>*That, that, JERK! how dare she think of any other girl but me!*<p>"Ranma" Akane says looking slightly upwards at the other girl,<p>"Um, yeah?" Ranma says nervously, seeing Akane's mad yet mischievous expression,<p>"Did you enjoy that kiss Shampoo gave you?" she asks sternly,<p>"Hmm, what? N-no of course not"<p>"Don't lie to me Ranma I can tell when you're lying"<p>"Ah, um, well, you see..."<p>"Ranma, for kissing another girl and lying to me, you have to be punished" she said in a stern yet provocative manner while shaking her finger,<br/>*and also for thinking perverted thoughts about another girl*<p>Akane then slips her hand between Ranma's legs and begins to caress the sensitive area, she then champs onto Ranma's right nipple and squeezes gently.<p>"Ah, Mmmm, Akane, what're you doing?" Ranma asks between noises,<p>"I'm making you suffer you pervert"<p>"Mmm, please, stop it Akane, we're out in public y'know"<br/>*What's gotten into her?*<p>*What has gotten into me?* She hastily shakes the thought aside and returns to 'punishing' Ranma,<br/>"What's the matter Ranma? Afraid?" She asks as she pauses briefly in her ministrations,<p>"What, I ain't afraid of nuthin, other than cats of course" Ranma says almost confidently,<p>"Oh yeah, well I bet you're too scared to fool around with me in public" Akane says, an obvious ploy,<p>"Oh yeah, keep talkin like that and I just might"<p>"I dare you"<p>"Okay, you asked for it"<p>Ranma pulls Akane into an embrace and kisses her passionately, and with one hand fondles her right breast, while Akane returns her hand to Ranma's crotch, they both move and grind against eachother while moaning barely loud enough for it to be audible over the sound effects of the movie, several male eye's have caught the display.<p>"Hey dude would you check out those two chicks making out over there"<p>"what, chicks makin out, where? Oh man they're both sexy as hell, what I wouldn't give to get a piece of that action"<p>"Yeah right man, they're both dykes, like they'd ever go for an ugly ass mofo like you"<p>"Hey a guy can dream right"<p>Though Ranma's mind is barely able to function whilst being intoxicated by pleasure, a single thought manages to permeate through her head,<br/>*we're both girls, this is perverted!*<p>Akane pulls away from Ranma and stares the shorter redhead in the eyes, they're are both beet red and flustered after making out so brazenly in public.<p>"Um, Ranma, I don't know what's come over me recently, I've been acting so, perverted"<p>"It's okay Akane, I like you better this way, now we're both perverts, and ummm, I really enjoyed what we we're, umm, doing just now" Ranma says as she fidgets and presses her index fingers together,<br/>"It felt really good"<br/>*Oh man I am so embarrassed what's Akane guna think, ARGE, I'm a sex fiend!*<p>"Umm, Ranma, ah, if you like we can kiss some more"<p>"oh, okay"<p>They continue kissing and fondling each other till the movie has finished, a large portion of the male movie goers now realized that they wore pants which were far too tight, and are a little annoyed at missing nearly the entire movie.<p>-<p>Ranma and Akane have returned home and Akane is sitting in her room pondering her odd behaviour.<p>*Why have I been acting so perverted lately, can it all be because of the wish I made*<p>Akane thinks back over the events of last night, and the wish she had made.<p>'I just wish I knew how he truly feels'<br/>*That's what I said when I saw that shooting star, and now I can't seem to stop myself from touching Ranma's body, hmm, 'how he truly feels' OH MY GOD, what if, what if what ever being granted my wish didn't know whether I meant 'how he feels' emotionally or 'how he feels' physically..*<p>She pounds her fist into her hand.<p>*That's it! all my sexual inhibitions have been removed, I used to be so shy about expressing my feelings towards Ranma, and now I'm all over him, even when he's been a girl, oh I'm such a temptress* she smiles at the thought of tempting Ranma with her feminine wiles, and then prepares to go to sleep, all the while hearing Ranma's lustful thoughts about her, she turns off the light and slips into bed.<p>A perverted old malevolent being watches things from a tiny peep hole in the fabric of reality.<br/>"Heh heh, you got yer wish girly, and then some, HEH HEH HEH HErk* *Cough*Ack* goes into a coughing fit,<br/>"Hmm, I wonder how long till they do it, heh heh"<p>-<p>Ranma has slipped into the furo for a quick soak and is thinking over the days events.<br/>*Oh man, tonight was..weird, Akane is like a totally different person, since yesterday she's changed into a horny sex kitten, and the way she felt me up, even with me as a girl! I want her to touch me like that more often, I want to feel her naked sweaty body against mine, I want to feel her body tremble as I bring us both toward ecstasy, with the way she is now, that's a definite possibility* He thought with a grin,<br/>*I'm just so studly how can any girl resist me, heh heh, and even as a girl they still want me* Yes, Ranma has a big ego.<p>-<br/>**Hey heyyy, I just gave Akane a reason to be a whole lot sleazier, oh I'm guna have fun with this, though it may have to convert to an 'R' rating, feh, whatever, hope j00 orl lieked this chapter anyway.**
