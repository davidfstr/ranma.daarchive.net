</div>        Valley of the Wind Productions presents...<br/>Power<br/>A Ranma 1/2 Fanfic by Intrasonic<p>&gt; brackets denote Chinese speech<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;">Part 6</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The young child obediently knelt before the  father, quietly taking in ever word being spoken. The father was idly fingering  a thin, worn-through book, although his lecturing seemed not to include  it as a reference at the moment.<br/>The child's state of health looked rather  poor, to say the least. From their feet to their arms to their face, there  was scarcely a spot devoid of cuts or scratches. It was mere speculation  how far beneath the half-shredded training gi the injuries extended. Large  stains of dried blood were still visible across the clothing, although  it would be guessed that most of it had been cleaned off the child's skin.  The eyes were bloodshot, as though they had gone far too long without meaningful  sleep. Even now, they were darting back and forth nervously, as though  expecting to spot some unseen danger in the room.<br/>"A martial artist must be prepared to give  his life for The Art," the father was saying, his tone of voice suggesting  that it was an oft-repeated mantra. "In the quest for excellence, they  do not fear for themselves. The Art comes first, last and always. The Art  is everything."<br/>"Yes, father."<br/>"Then why are you afraid?"<br/>"I... I..." A small tear trickled down the  child's check unbidden, quickly brushed away. "I'm not... afraid," they  whispered quietly.<br/>The father was unmoved. "I didn't hear you."<br/>"I'm not afraid," the child repeated, louder  this time.<br/>"I don't think you believe it."<br/>"I'm not afraid!" the child retorted, now  standing. Their face winced as the sudden movement aggravated the scores  of injuries across their body. "I'm not afraid!"<br/>The father smiled thinly. "Then why don't  you trust me? I'm only doing my best to make you the strongest martial  artist in the world."<br/>The child swallowed, but remained in place.<br/>Almost hypnotically, the father continued  to speak. "You cannot be the strongest without overcoming your fears. You  must be strong and face whatever holds you back. Only then can you truly  master The Art. Do you understand?"<br/>The child nodded, more resolve now evident  in their stance.<br/>In response, the father produced something  from a bag and held it out for the child to take. A string of fish-cakes.<br/>Instinctively, the child backed up a step,  arms tensed, as though to ward off the offending object. From beyond the  two, a hole in the floor yawned, almost as though waiting to be fed. Occasionally,  a muffled caterwaul echoed upwards, prompting the child to cringe at the  sound.<br/>"You must overcome your fears," the father  repeated. "Persistence and sacrifice are the keys to perfection of The  Art."<br/>Hesitantly, the child reached out their hand  to accept the fish-cakes.<br/>"Only by persisting will you succeed in learning  this technique."<br/>Slowly, the fingers grasped the string holding  the various cakes together.<br/>"True power does not come easily. But a true  martial artist understands this and presses ahead nonetheless. In the end,  only The Art matters."<br/>Trembling, the child wrapped the cakes around  their legs, waist, shoulders and arms, until the entire length was used  up. Straightening again, they looked beseechingly towards their father.<br/>In reply, the father's face was expressionless,  nodding curtly before glancing meaningfully towards the hole in the floor.  "I told you before. Don't give up, and the cats will teach you the Nekoken."<br/>The child was standing before the pit now.  Below, glowing eyes peered up from the darkness, the smells of the fish  slowly beginning to reach downwards. "T-they... didn't want to teach me  last time... or the time before..."<br/>"That's because you hadn't proved yourself  worthy. You must persevere, and prove yourself their better!"<br/>The cats were beginning to wake up, their  yowls getting louder. The boy shivered, exerting all his will-power to  keep from running away from the hole.<br/>The father approached, alongside the child.  "I've devoted myself to training you to be the best martial artist in the  world. I believe you can do it, with all my heart. Can't you trust me in  return?"<br/>The child slowly nodded, new resolve coming  into their eyes. Taking a deep breath and a purposeful step forwards into  the space above the pit... the resolve shattered again.<br/>"N-NOOOO! DADDYYyyyy..."<br/>The child's shrieks were quickly lost amidst  the cries and yowls of a hundred starving cats.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>It was early afternoon that Cologne first heard  signs of stirring from the bedroom of her Great-granddaughter. Quietly  ascending the steps, the aged matriarch pushed open the door to the sleeping  quarters.<br/>Shampoo was still sleeping, although she was  haphazardly wrapped in her bed sheets, and now lying on the floor. Even  now, she would twist or thrash in a way that suggested a less than peaceful  sleep.<br/>Xian Pu, wake up, &gt; Cologne whispered,  tapping the girl on the shoulder.<br/>The reaction was immediate. With a shriek,  Shampoo launched herself at Cologne, her right hand lashing out violently.<br/>By this time, the matriarch had already moved  out of reach, allowing Shampoo's hand to merely rip out a section of the  wall before she was tripped up by her own bedsheets.<br/>Urgh... &gt;<br/>Awake now? &gt; Cologne inquired, once again  approaching her great-granddaughter.<br/>Shampoo was hugging herself, shivering despite  the warm room. I... was having a nightmare... I think. &gt;<br/>Cologne's smile was somewhat wry. I would  like to think that you wouldn't normally attack me like that. What  sort of dream did you have? &gt;<br/>It was... strange. I was only a child...  and I was in a pit... full of cats... &gt;<br/>Sounds like you were learning the Nekoken  in your dream. That <i>could</i> be considered rather traumatic. &gt;<br/>But I was never taught the Nekoken. &gt;  Shampoo abruptly swallowed. But Ranma was... &gt;<br/>Quite true. The technique is supposed  to render the trainees permanently insane. I was always impressed that  Ranma survived it so well. &gt;<br/>The younger amazon's face was suddenly nervous.   Great-grandmother... about the technique Ranma and myself were practising...  &gt;<br/>What about it? &gt;<br/>What if... we both tried it at the same  time? &gt; The worry in her voice suggested that it was perhaps more than  just an idle question.<br/>Cologne shrugged in reply, permitting the  question to remain abstract. I suppose if you had done it at the exact  same time, it is possible that you might have both picked up stray thoughts  from the other. Perhaps you should only attempt it one at a time from now  on. &gt;<br/>Shampoo nodded, getting to her feet.   Perhaps you are right. It... was a terrifying dream. I never realized how  terrible an experience it must have been for him. &gt;<br/>Really, when you consider what you went  through to become the warrior that you are... is it so surprising what  he went through to become even stronger than you? &gt;<br/>Shampoo had no answer to that.<br/>Do not let it disturb you too much, &gt;  Cologne admonished soothingly. By now, those thoughts should have  all but faded away. &gt;<br/>I... hope so. It is strange to fear something  that I turn into... &gt;<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Ranma?"<br/>After placing her ear to the door, and hearing  no response, Akane deliberated on what to do next. Ranma being Ranma, he  was always happy to eat. But he had to be awake and at the table to do  that. And lunch was about to be served right now. Normally, she would have  simply barged in and soaked him into the land of the awake.<br/>But things were a little different right now.  The two of them were... friendlier than they had been for a long time.  To be specific, they were about to go on a mutual outing tonight, to watch  a movie and grab a bite to eat together. Not a date, but still an outing.  And the last thing she wanted during that outing was for him to be angry  about her dumping water on him.<br/>"...even better," Nabiki was continuing, "wouldn't  you love for him to be grateful to you, for waking him up for lunch?"<br/>Akane gave her older sister a patient glare.  "I get the idea, Nabiki. No need to overdo the advice, okay?"<br/>Nabiki gave a thin smile. "Right. So wake  up him up. Nicely."<br/>Akane nodded, deliberating on various options  before slowly turning back to Nabiki. "Um... what do you think would be  the best way?"<br/>Resisting the urge to laugh, Nabiki merely  smiled again. "This is where you walk in, find Ranma in some rather compromising  situation, don't give him a chance to explain, completely loose your temper,  then belt him out the window into the pond. And have him mad at you all  day."<br/>"Right. I'll do that... hey!"<br/>"So to <i>prevent</i> that from happening,  why don't you first take a slow peek into his room and see if he's still  sleeping?"<br/>"Oh. Okay."<br/>Before Akane was able to nudge the door open,  a loud yell came from the room. Followed by several loud crashes. Followed  by one big crash. Followed by silence, then a splash outside.<br/>Nervously, Akane turned back to her sister.  "What do I do now?"<br/>"This, little sister, is where you <i>screw</i>  subtlety, go in and try to figure out what the heck is going on."<br/>Akane immediately did so. "What's going on,  Ranma?"<br/>"He's not in the room," Nabiki pointed out  after a moment. "And there's a big hole in the wall. And we heard a splash.  He's probably in the pond right now."<br/>"Oh. Right."<br/>Even as both went to examine the rather obvious  point of exit. Peering through it, a clear picture of the backyard pond  was visible, complete with a sputtering redhead in the middle of it. Ranma  was wearing the same clothing she had left the house in yesterday, which  suggested that she had come home tired enough to sleep in them.<br/>Ranma looked around in bewilderment before  looking up at the two girls looking down at her. "Whadya do <i>that</i>  for?" she demanded.<br/>"I didn't do anything!" Akane retorted.<br/>"Then how'd I get <i>here</i>?"<br/>"You did that yourself," Nabiki quickly interjected,  before the arguing could escalate any further. "Akane was about to wake  you up for LUNCH, actually."<br/>The word 'lunch' was normally a suitable distraction  where Ranma was concerned, but strangely enough, it didn't seem to be this  time. "Uh... I think I'll pass on lunch."<br/>Akane swallowed. "I... I'm not cooking this  time. Kasumi is..."<br/>Ranma nodded idly, getting to her feet. "That's  okay. I'm not really hungry right now. I'm just gonna go for a walk."<br/>As though to solidify her point, Ranma emerged  from the pond, shaking the water off herself as best she could. That failing,  she did the sensible thing and took off her shirt to wring it out. Sensible,  if not especially appropriate.<br/>Akane's glared downwards. "Do you mifphghgph..."<br/>Nabiki removed her hand from Akane's mouth.  "What you <i>meant</i> to ask him," she whispered, "was 'Did you have some  sort of dream last night?'."<br/>"Um... right. Did you have some sort of dream  last night, Ranma?"<br/>The redhead looked up from wringing her shirt  out. "Uh... yeah. It's nothing."<br/>"Well... you were yelling in your sleep. And  you broke a hole in the wall."<br/>"Just... a nightmare. That's all. How come  you're so concerned?"<br/>"I'm not conmfpghghgh..."<br/>Once again, Nabiki clamped a hand over her  sister's mouth and pulled her away from the window. "Think first, talk  second," she admonished quietly. "Now try again."<br/>Akane's head reappeared again. "I was just...  making sure you're okay."<br/>Ranma briefly raised an eyebrow and she put  her shirt back on again. "Er... thanks. I'm just gonna be gone for awhile."<br/>"Okay. Um... have a nice walk." The two girls  watched Ranma vault over the backyard wall, then turned to face each other.<br/>"Getting better, little sister."<br/>"Would you quit interrupting me, Nabiki?"<br/>"Akane, I can see your insults coming a mile  away. You've got to stop saying the first thing that comes to your head.  You're going to a movie tonight. I'm not going to be there for you. You  have to make a conscious effort to think things over, <i>then</i> talk."<br/>"But he just walked off, even after I said  nice things!"<br/>"He was going to walk off no matter what,  Akane. But right now, he's walking off with a few things on his mind. Such  as the fact that you were going to wake him up for lunch. And the fact  that you wanted to know why he woke up so roughly. And that you wanted  to know that he was okay. And the longer he walks around, the longer he's  going to think about those things."<br/>"Oh. I never thought of things that way."<br/>"Trust me, little sister, I did. Now if you  really want to score a few points before tonight, let's try planning ahead  a little. Ranma's missing lunch now."<br/>"He said it was okay..."<br/>"Akane, this is Ranma we're talking about.  He's a bottomless pit on his good days. Right now, he's been training his  brains out. Whatever nightmare he had is probably bothering him more than  his stomach. But when he gets back in an hour or so..."<br/>"He'll be asking when supper is."<br/>"Right. So what would be a good thing to do?  That he would appreciate?"<br/>Akane looked thoughtful, before finally brightening.  "I could... make an extra meal for him!"<br/>Nabiki resisted the urge to groan. "Uh...  yes, you could. But there's something else you could do, that's even easier  to do. What do you think that would be?"<br/>"I... could... set aside a plate for him!"<br/>Nabiki resisted the urge to jump for joy.  "Why, that's an <i>excellent</i> idea, little sister. Maybe you should  do that before Mr. Saotome eats his son's share."<br/>"Right!"<br/>Nabiki watched Akane race down towards the  table, gently thumping her head against the wall. Were they even related?  How could someone be so ignorantly one-minded? And this was only one-half  of the equation. Ranma's big mouth was possibly even worse than Akane's  impulsive reacting. And they were supposed to go to a movie together? And  watch the whole thing without hating each other? And eventually get <i>married</i>?<br/>Perhaps it was time for desperate measures.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>It was with an unhurried pace that Ranma slowly  progressed down the street, having stopped only at a restaurant for a glass  of hot water. Whether it was by luck or subconscious intent, he continued  on a path that kept him well away from the dwellings of any of his rivals  or fiancees. Which was just as well, as he had other things on his mind.<br/>He hadn't lied to Akane. He <i>had</i> woken  up from a dream. But he wasn't entirely certain what to make of the dream.  It hadn't seemed... quite real. Enough to honestly scare the hell out of  him, yet somewhat surreal from the onset. And unlike a lot of dreams,  he could still remember this one fairly well...<p>The dense jungle seemed to continue on without  end. Stepping over fallen trees, pushing through patches of overgrown leaves  and grass, and slogging through pools of mud. These, along with countless  other obstacles, sought to halt forward progress. But all were cross and  mastered, footprints and flattened vegetation serving as proof to any who  would follow her.<br/>Her? Ranma shrugged off the observation with  practised ease. He had long been able to tell whether he was male or female  without actually looking at himself or hearing himself talk. Although her  body seemed... smaller. Weaker. Shorter. Even for his female body. Like  he was just a child.<br/>A scramble up a small rock face made the situation  clearer as he occasionally was forced to look at his various limbs to make  sure they had found a secure purchase. He <i>was</i> just a child at the  moment. Young enough that his body was still fairly<br/>androgynous, yet not so young that he wasn't able to detect a slightly  lower centre of gravity and a distinct lack of something between his legs.  So he was definitely a young, female child at the moment.<br/>This information was regulated to a background  knowledge as he crested the rock face and continued onwards without even  stopping to take a breath. A large object was strapped to her back, although  its identity was unknown. The whole time, her gaze was constantly shifting,  viewing the surroundings with suspicion. Every bush, patch of grass, boulder  or low-hanging tree branch was suspect as a hiding place. The ground was  ruthlessly analysed for betraying footprints or telltale tufts of orange  and black fur.<br/>That information jolted Ranma. She was hunting?  Or running away? The idea of running was unconsciously and violently rejected.  Running was absolutely not an option. Better to die a thousand deaths before  running away. Right now, she was most certainly the hunter. Hunting what?  A formidable hunter in its own right, something that had orange and black  fur...<br/>Fear began to gnaw at the edges of Ranma's  mind as her mind filled her in on the journey's objective. Ridiculous.  Impossible. She was just a child. No matter how skilled, she was just a  child. And she was going to single-handedly kill a... TIGER?<br/>Frantically, Ranma tried to change her course.  She ordered her legs to stop moving, to turn around and return to... wherever  she had come from. She didn't have a prayer the way things stood. Maybe  in a few years. But right now, against a giant beast like a tiger, with  long sharp claws and teeth and fangs and...<br/>Ranma renewed her efforts to backpedal. For  kami's sake, it was a CAT! She'd go into conniptions before she even caught  sight of it. Just the knowledge of its presence would make her freeze up,  never mind actually <i>seeing</i> it. The beast would have its huge canines  clamped around her throat in seconds, and she'd be twitching like a helpless  doll the whole time.<br/>The fear was most certainly there, Ranma knew.  It was frantically trying to penetrate her mind in full force, to prompt  her body into motions that would result in escape. Unfortunately, for some  reason, her body was simply choosing to ignore it in full force. And that  was going to prove to be a very bad thing soon, Ranma was positive...<br/>A snarl caught her attention.<br/>Right in the middle of the pseudo-pathway,  her quarry was waiting. Kami-knew-how-many-hundred pounds of solid muscle,  bone and fur, with five out of six ends possessing surgically-sharp cutting  instruments. Two thin slits eyed her with disdain, clearly not viewing  her as anything beyond a possible meal. And not a very large one at that.<br/>For her part, Ranma froze wide-eyed in her  tracks. Her feet felt rooted to the ground, her arms rigid at her side.  Even her mouth didn't budge, caught in a half open gape. As big as she  might have known her prey to be, knowledge failed to do justice to what  was before her. Her previous estimations of who the predator and who the  prey were quickly began to be thrown into question...<br/>Ranma frantically ordered her body to turn  and runrunrun-<br/>In response, her teeth finally clamped down  together, even as she bent her limbs into a ready position. Reaching behind  her back, she took hold of the object strapped to it and brought it forth.  Several yards of cloth fell to the ground, revealing a double-handed sword  that was longer than she was tall. The metal surface looked mildly tarnished,  save for the recently sharpened edge. Shifting her stance slightly to accommodate  the oversized weapon's weight, she levelled the point between hers and  the tiger's eyes.<br/>-runrunrunrunrunrun-<br/>Even as the animal sprang towards her with  deadly intent, Ranma felt herself mirroring the lunge, screaming out a  cry of challenge as her arms strained to bring the blade around in a wide  arc...<p>Ranma shuddered at the memory of his dream,  absent-mindedly turning a corner and continuing down another street. So  lifelike... as though he had actually been there, hunting through  the jungle, confronting the tiger, swinging the sword...<br/>But he knew it wasn't real. Not by a long  shot. Too many things wrong with it. For starters, he would never have  been using such a weapon. He was capable of using weapons, of course, but  he'd always felt that they were limiting and inflexible for real combat.  Secondly, he had been a young girl in the dream. He hadn't had his encounter  with Jusenkyou until he was sixteen years old.<br/>But most significant of all was the encounter  with the tiger. He hadn't run away. Certainly he had frozen up in fear.  He'd been completely paralysed for a time. But then it had gone away, and  he'd attacked. That wasn't supposed to happen. He should have simply stood  there, possibly losing his mind and fighting like a cat.<br/>He'd had dreams involving the Nekoken before.  They had been very scarce over the past few years, usually only after he'd  gotten into some fix involving it. There had definitely been no Nekoken  in this dream. So where had the dream come from?<p>A small pebble bounced off Ranma's head, jolting  him from his thoughts. Briefly halting his walk, his turned his head in  the direction it had come to from.<br/>From between two close buildings, a head was  peering out warily. Wreathed in her blue hair, Shampoo's face was immediately  recognizable. Beckoning him with her hand, she withdrew behind the wall  again.<br/>Looking around briefly, Ranma noticed that  the few people on the street were otherwise occupied. Sidestepping, he  was soon behind the wall, next to the Amazon.<br/>"How come you're hiding?" he wanted to know.<br/>Shampoo shook her head. "We train secret,  yes? Not want people see together."<br/>"Gotcha. So what's up?"<br/>Judging from the troubled look on Shampoo's  face, he thought he might have an idea what exactly was up. Her opening  words confirmed it. "Ranma have dream last night?"<br/>"Uh... yeah. You could say that. You know  anything about it?"<br/>"Shampoo talk with Great-grandmother. She  say it okay. Happen because try at same time. Okay if try one at time."<br/>Ranma breathed a sigh of relief. "That's good."<br/>Shampoo was nodding in agreement.<br/>They stood facing each other in silence for  several moments, ignoring and being ignored by several passerbyers. As  for what was going on in their heads...<br/>"WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?" Ranma finally  exploded.<br/>"WHY YOU LISTEN TO STUPID FATHER?" Shampoo  demanded, just as vehement.<br/>They trailed off into several more moments  of silence before winding up again.<br/>"You tryin' to get yourself killed?" Ranma  continued. "Goin' after a tiger when you're just a little kid? You must  be crazy!"<br/>"Shampoo not crazy! Shampoo think <i>Ranma</i>  crazy! Listen to stupid father and cover in fish and go down in hole full  of hungry cat!"<br/>"I was TRAINING!"<br/>"Shampoo TRAIN!"<br/>"A martial artist must be prepared to lay  down his life for the art!"<br/>"Amazon warrior never afraid to die!"<br/>Another period of silence ensued between the  two.<br/>Ranma finally spoke, his voice quieter. "I...  I guess you beat the tiger, huh?"<br/>Shampoo's voice was also more subdued. "Shampoo...  kill tiger. Very bad hurt. Almost die when try go back to village. Take  long time to recover. See Ranma not crazy after learn Nekoken?"<br/>"Well... I was... pretty messed up after the  third time. Those c-c-animals are nasty when they're hungry. But, yeah,  I guess I got over it and got training again."<br/>"Great-grandmother say thoughts go away."<br/>"That's good. It sure was weird, imagining  myself attacking a c-cat like that..."<br/>Shampoo nodded. "Shampoo never afraid of own  curse before."<br/>"No kidding. Anyway, I gotta get back to the  dojo."<br/>"We practice tonight?"<br/>"Yeah. I'm gonna be a little late, but I'll  be there."<br/>"Ranma remember promise to be man when fight?"<br/>He didn't quite remember <i>promising</i>  that, but... "Uh... yeah, okay."<br/>"Is good. See tonight." That said, Shampoo  took off down the alleyway, heading back towards the Nekohanten. For his  part, Ranma simply exited the alleyway, resuming his walk down the street.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Yum! This sure beats your cooking by a long  shot!"<br/>Akane gritted her teeth and clenched her fists  until her knuckles whitened. "You... you... you just wait until I've had  a little more practice."<br/>"That'll be a few years, for sure."<br/>"That's what you thought about martial arts  too! And I can kick <i>your</i> butt easily!"<br/>"Hold!"<br/>Akane sighed. "What now?"<br/>Nabiki shook her head. "Bad answer. That's  a sore point with Ranma. You don't want to remind him like that."<br/>"I'm not going to be a doormat!"<br/>"Of course not. But you could have phrased  that better. A lot better."<br/>"How?"<br/>"You could have said 'Maybe, but it's just  like martial arts. Practice makes perfect'."<br/>Akane reluctantly nodded her head. "Okay."<br/>Nabiki nodded approvingly. It wasn't easy,  but she had high hopes that this 'training' would pay off in the long run.  She couldn't very well do anything about Ranma and his amazing ability  to say the exact wrong thing at any given time. But she could do plenty  about Akane's amazing ability to misinterpret anything in the worst possible  way. And she was doing that right now.<br/>For the past hour, she had gone through the  bulk of what Ranma was likely to say at any given time, and showed Akane  how to diffuse any possible conflicts before they even started. It was  tiring work, but like most martial artists, Ranma was a predictable person.  And so were his insults.<br/>"Alright," she decided. "Let's say that you've  just gotten out of the movie. And you both feel like a quick bite to eat  before going back home."<br/>"So we go to a restaurant?"<br/>"And Ranma says 'Hey, Ucchan's is just a few  blocks away'."<br/>Akane frowned. "The only reason he'd say that  was if he planned on trying to make me jealous!"<br/>"Ahem."<br/>"I mean... 'I don't want to eat there'."<br/>"So Ranma says 'How come?'"<br/>Akane let out an exasperated breath. "I don't  know!"<br/>Nabiki sighed. "You have to think about these  things, little sister. I would suggest something along the lines of 'We'd  never eat our meal in peace if we ate there. Ukyou would think we're on  a date or something'."<br/>"Why would I say that?"<br/>"One, Ranma will love the idea of no fighting  happening. Two, he'll agree with the idea that the two of you aren't on  a date. Three, there's plenty of other places to eat at near that theatre."<br/>"Oh. I guess that makes sense."<br/>"Of course it does. Now... try this one. Ranma  orders too much food, and realizes that he can't pay for it. So he tries  to borrow some money from you. What do you do?"<br/>"Tell him to find someone else to borrow money  from... I mean, say no?"<br/>"Keep trying, Akane."<br/>"I'm not just going to give him money! I'm  not exactly rich, you know."<br/>"So you lend it to him. And to let him keep  his pride, you say that he can pay you back whenever he's able to. And  that's the end of the problem. You finish your meal and you go home. What's  the last thing you have to do?"<br/>Akane blushed. "I'm not going to <i>kiss</i>  him!"<br/>Nabiki groaned. "You've been watching too  many romance movies, Akane. Any kissing on this outing either means that  things went <i>really</i> well, or that someone is moving too fast. Try  again."<br/>"Uh... Remind him to pay me back?"<br/>"No, you split up, and go home separately,  so no one suspects anything. Do I have to explain why?"<br/>"No, I understand that."<br/>Nabiki stood up wearily. "Alright then. That  should cover all the worst case scenarios. You two should both arrive home  alive."<br/>"I still don't get why <i>I</i> have to do  all this, and he doesn't."<br/>"Once you start, I'll bet that he'll reciprocate  and act just as nice. You just have to set a good example. And once he  gets <i>really</i> interested, I'll be happy to offer a little advice to  him. For a price, of course."<br/>Akane laughed at that. "Of course."<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;">end part 6</p>
