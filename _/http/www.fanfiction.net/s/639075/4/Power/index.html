</div>        Valley of the Wind Productions presents...<br/>Power<br/>A Ranma 1/2 Fanfic by Intrasonic<p>&gt; brackets denote Chinese speech<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;">Part 4</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>It was with a great deal of apprehension that  Ranma was undertaking his stretching routines. He was presently at his  newly designated practice location, one that was within short distance  to home, yet well hidden enough to avoid discovery by anyone else. The  fact that it was late at night would also help. The last thing he needed  was for Akane to get wind that he was training with-<br/>"Nihao!"<br/>-Shampoo. "Hi Shampoo," he greeted neutrally.<br/>The Amazon quietly made her way into the clearing,  smiling and flexing her fingers. "Ranma ready fight?"<br/>Ranma sucked in his breath. "Yeah, I'm ready.  But I'm fightin' as a girl!"<br/>Shampoo narrowed her eyes. "Ranma say that  girl weak?"<br/>Ranma took another breath. He'd trained hard  for this conversation, and he'd expected this accusation. "I'm saying that  <i>my</i> girl form is weaker than <i>my</i> guy form. So it's better practice  for me. That's all."<br/>A good answer. Worth the hour it had taken  to put it together, judging by the satisfied nod on the Amazon's face.  "Shampoo not care which form Ranma in. She want get better."<br/>"Right," Ranma agreed, glad that the crisis  point was past. Soaking himself with the water bottle he'd brought along,  he let the mild disorientation leave him as he was left with a smaller  body. "Alright, if I'm gonna help you get better, I gotta know where you're  at."<br/>Shampoo looked bewildered as she approached  Ranma. "Where Shampoo at? Shampoo here."<br/>Ranma groaned. "I mean, I gotta know how good  you are-URK!"<br/>Shampoo withdrew her fist with a smirk. "Shampoo  understand."<br/>Ranma rubbed her forehead where Shampoo had  hit her. Well, she couldn't very well accuse Shampoo of no arm-strength.  If Shampoo wanted to play that way... "Not bad. Did you see that, <i>Akane</i>?"<br/>Shampoo's eyes shot open as she spun around.  "Where Violent-girl-AIEEE!"<br/>Ranma mirrored Shampoo's smirk as the Amazon  tumbled head over heels several times before skipping to her feet. "Two  can play <i>that</i> game!"<br/>Shampoo dusted herself off. "Shampoo think  hold back against weak girl-Ranma, but she not show mercy now."<br/>"Hah! You think I'm <i>weak</i>! I can take  you in <i>any</i> form!"<br/>"Ranma just try!"<br/>Even as Ranma lunged towards her, Shampoo  couldn't help but smile. Her Great-grandmother had been right. Prodding  Ranma's arrogance was a good way 'help' him put aside reservations about  hitting girls. He was far better than her, of course. But this would be  a fun fight.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>It was over an hour later that the two combatants  finally stepped back from each other to catch their breath.<br/>Shampoo resisted the urge to sink to her knees.  Her entire body was aching and her heart was threatening to burst right  out of her chest. If she hadn't already known it, she never would have  believed it. Ranma's endurance was absolutely inhuman. Even as a female.  "Ranma... okay," she granted.<br/>Ranma smirked. The redhead was breathing heavily,  and had several bruises, but she looked to have plenty more fight in her.  "Heh. This is training, right? You won't get any better unless you push  yourself to the limit. If you don't think you can handle it..."<br/>Shampoo glared evilly at him. "Shampoo never  give up! If Ranma not tired, maybe he not try hard enough!"<br/>"That wasn't what I meant!"<br/>"Then what Ranma mean? He hold back, Shampoo  know!"<br/>"Well, whadaya expect? The only people I don't  hold back against are people like Ryouga or Happousai!"<br/>That subdued Shampoo a little. She didn't  think she had any desire to experience the Chestnut Fist or the Hiryuu  Shoten Ha any time soon. But just the same...<br/>"You think Shampoo afraid get hurt?"<br/>"No. But I ain't gonna be the one who does  it."<br/>Her brows furrowed again. Time to play the  wild card. "Ranma prefer Violent-girl hurt Shampoo instead?"<br/>Ranma's jaw dropped. "What is <i>that</i>  supposed to mean?"<br/>"Get hurt part of training, ne? Better get  little hurt when train. Then no get big hurt in real fight."<br/>Ranma scowled, a sure indication of the inability  to directly refute the point. "Yeah, but even still..."<br/>"Maybe Shampoo try learn Bakusai Tenketsu."<br/>"You can't be serious! That's for pig-headed  idiots like Ryouga!"<br/>"It for people who not have other person to  practice with!"<br/>The two glared at each other for a few moments  in silence.<br/>Shampoo finally cracked her knuckles. "Shampoo  rest long enough. Train more."<br/>Ranma kept her eyes locked on Shampoo. She  finally shrugged. "Fine. You wanna train some more, I'm game for that."<br/>Shampoo was already moving, her fists moving  in a random pattern that she had pieced together back when she had been  on Ranma's trail. But she was still tired from the past hour, she knew.  And her movements were slower as a result.<br/>Ranma saw the movements long before they reached  her, twisting and jumping with wild abandon as every single attempt grazed  nothing but air. Another series of attacks resulted in the same.<br/>Shampoo backed off angrily. "Ranma make fun  of Shampoo!"<br/>"I ain't!" she protested. "I'm just practising  dodging!"<br/>"Why you no fight back?"<br/>"Cuz you're too tired right now. Besides,  it's all practice!"<br/>Shampoo bit her tongue to stifle a retort.  Ranma considered this practice? "Then Shampoo make Ranma tired too!"<br/>"Bring it on!" Ranma invited. "I ain't tired  at all!"<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Yet another hour later, the two combatants  backed off again.<br/>Shampoo was hyperventilating by now. "Sh-sham...  poo not... d-done... yet!"<br/>Ranma was breathing heavily. "Well... I ain't...  done yet.. either!"<br/>Gritting her teeth, Shampoo got to her feet  again. Her legs felt like ramen that had been boiled for an hour, barely  supporting her weight right now. But she forced herself to ignore the feeling.  She would <i>not</i> give Ranma the satisfaction of seeing her give up  now.<br/>"Keep... training," she informed him.<br/>"Keep... training," Ranma agreed.<br/>Shampoo approached her cautiously this time,  knowing that she had no energy to spare for wasted moves. She wasn't sure  she had energy for useful moves, actually.<br/>It was with some satisfaction that she noted  that Ranma was finally beginning to show signs of tiredness. It was about  time... she just had to keep the redhead off balance. Fight unexpectedly,  she admonished herself.<br/>Even as she plotted her approach, Ranma did  a very surprising thing. She collapsed.<br/>"Ranma?" Shampoo inquired, not letting her  guard down. She didn't doubt that Ranma was fully capable of trying such  a move to get her to lower her defenses. After several moments, she realized  that Ranma's breathing had slowed as well. A quiet snore came from the  motionless body.<br/>Cautiously, Shampoo prodded the redhead's  shoulder with her toe. "Ranma sleep?"<br/>No response.<br/>Taking a deep breath, Shampoo summoned her  remaining strength and delivered a kick to Ranma's side. Ranma grunted  and rolled over, still completely out.<br/>A smile came over Shampoo's face as the situation  came into focus. For whatever reason, Ranma had just fallen! She had won!  Against all odds, somehow, she had triumphed over her superior opponent!  Wouldn't her Great-grandmother be proud of her!<br/>The earth-shattering revelation complete,  Shampoo then proceeded to unceremoniously collapse on the ground herself.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Shampoo didn't know how long she rested for,  but when she awoke, the moon was still overhead, informing her that it  was still nighttime. Her entire body ached, but in a fashion she was more  used to. The kind of aching that was meant as a reminder of how hard the  body had been worked recently.<br/>Propping her body up on her elbows, she looked  around in the darkness. Her eyes quickly fell upon Ranma's female form,  presently engaged in doing one-armed pushups. Obviously Ranma had recovered  much faster than she had.<br/>"Ranma awake?" she asked, getting to her feet.<br/>Ranma flipped backwards, landing on her feet.  "You're finally awake."<br/>"Shampoo win!"<br/>Ranma made a sour face. "Ya got lucky! Real  lucky!"<br/>A smile formed on Shampoo's face. This was  great! Time to rub some salt in the wounds. "Shampoo think Ranma just weak!"<br/>"I ain't weak! You just got lucky!"<br/>"Ranma prove."<br/>"Alright, I'll prove it to you! I used a special  technique when I was fighting."<br/>"Special technique?"<br/>"Yeah. It lets you fight at full strength  longer. But you get tired a lot faster. I ain't gonna use it next time!"<br/>As much as she hated to admit it, Ranma's  explanation made sense. No wonder the redhead had gone for so long without  even breaking a sweat. A good way to keep an opponent from knowing how  tired you were. Which left only one question. "How do technique?"<br/>"It's not a real technique. With practice,  you learn how to draw upon your strength better, even when it's running  out. No real easy way to learn it."<br/>Shampoo made a face. Oh well. Perhaps her  Great-grandmother was right. She would simply have to work at all-around  improvement.<br/>Ranma wasn't finished yet, perhaps suffering  from more than a small amount of wounded pride. "But next time we fight,  I ain't gonna bother usin' it! So don't go thinkin' that you're <i>ever</i>  gonna beat me again!"<br/>Oh yes, his pride was wounded, Shampoo noted  with some satisfaction. It made every ache and pain worth it. And what  had he said? <i>Next</i> time? "Ranma still think Shampoo weak girl?"<br/>Ranma swallowed. "Uh... well... you're still  a girl and all..."<br/>"We meet tomorrow?"<br/>Ranma nodded. "Get some sleep. Cuz tomorrow  I'm gonna be serious!"<br/>"Then Shampoo train at home during day."<br/>The two locked gazes briefly. Ranma finally  shrugged. "Okay, do that. Ask the Ol' Ghoul if she knows any tricks that  might come in handy too. It might be a couple of weeks at this rate before  we're good enough to take on Akane."<br/>"Then practice for couple weeks."<br/>Ranma nodded. "Right. I gotta get back to  the dojo. Don't tell anybody 'bout this place, got it? I'm tryin' to keep  it a secret from Akane. She doesn't know that I'm practising like this."<br/>"Shampoo not tell. except Great-grandmother.  It be surprise."<br/>"Right. See ya' tomorrow." The redhead ran  off.<br/>Shampoo waved goodbye before sprinting away  through the forest herself. The route was somewhat circular, to ensure  that if anyone saw her running at this time of night, they would be hard  pressed to track her back to the forest. She couldn't wait to tell her  Great-grandmother about it all!<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>It was noon the next day when Ranma finally  awoke. His entire body was still aching, but he shrugged it off with a  ease born of long experience. Nevertheless, the hot bath brought welcome  relief of the pain.<br/>Ranma let himself sink down into the water,  relishing the soothing feeling. The training was rough, but he knew it  was making him better. Perhaps it was fortunate that Shampoo wasn't slowing  him down as much as he'd feared. She wasn't nearly as good as he was, but  with a few modifications, he was able to bring himself down to her level,  which meant both of them got a good workout. At the very least, he had  to give her credit for sticking it out so long. She was clearly determined  to improve herself. Crazy amazon pride...<p>A knock on the door jolted him from his thoughts.  "Ranma?"<br/>Akane. "Uh, yeah?"<br/>"Are you going to be down soon? Kasumi's going  to have lunch ready in five minutes."<br/>Lunch sounded good. Considering that he'd  missed breakfast. "Yeah, I'll be right out. Aren't you supposed to be in  school?"<br/>"It's Saturday."<br/>"Oh."<br/>"What time did you get home last night? You  must be really tired."<br/>"I dunno. Real late."<br/>"Oh. I was starting to wor-wonder, that's  all," Akane answered, sounding a little hasty. "Uh... well, don't be late  for lunch."<br/>Ranma heard her rapidly walking away. She  sounded... agitated for some reason. Although he couldn't begin to imagine  why...<br/>His stomach growled, providing a more concrete  notion to contemplate. Getting out of the water, he dried himself off quickly.  Lunchtime it was. Right now, even Akane's cooking seemed welcome.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"So what do you think?"<br/>Ranma chewed a few times experimentally. Honestly,  if he hadn't lost that stupid fight against her, and been <i>forced</i>  to eat her cooking...<br/>"Well?" Akane repeated after a few moments.<br/>Ranma finally swallowed. Surprisingly enough,  it was pretty good. He could still taste what had to be at least ten times  the required amount of salt. And he wasn't sure how vinegar had gotten  into the rice. And this wasn't the first time it had happened... "Not...  too bad, I guess."<br/>Akane's face lit up like a cherub. "Really?  You really mean that?"<br/>"Well... yeah..."<br/>"Really, Akane," Nabiki chided with a smirk.  "Hasn't speaking his mind <i>always</i> been Ranma's strong point? I think  you can trust him."<br/>Ranma wasn't sure whether to take that as  a vote of support or an insult. Knowing Nabiki, probably both at the same  time. "Uh... what she said, I guess."<br/>"Great! Help yourself!"<br/>Ranma's stomach was still growling. He shrugged  inwardly. He was starving, and it seemed that this was one meal that wouldn't  actually put him out of commission. His training would be much more effective  if it had some nourishment to work with.<br/>"Pile it on," he invited.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>It was about half an hour later that Akane  was reclining on the her bed, still relishing the euphoric feeling of hearing  her fiancé compliment her cooking. It had been the source of countless  arguments. So many rejections and insults over just that... but today had  made it all worth it! Just hearing Ranma ask for <i>more</i>. And she knew  he hadn't been lying, because she'd even watched his face for any discolouration.  And he'd swallowed every bite!<br/>Her giddy smile returned in full as her mind  rapidly cycled through meal possibilities for supper. Why, the cookbook  was full of ideas for her to try. Her cooking had obviously improved. By  the end of the week, Ranma would be <i>begging</i> her to cook<br/>things for him!<br/>"Come down from cloud nine yet?"<br/>Akane started as she recognized Nabiki's voice.  "Oh, hi, Nabiki."<br/>"It looks like you're really improving in  the kitchen, little sister."<br/>"Well, practice makes perfect."<br/>"I don't doubt it. Keep this up, and Ranma  is going to run out of insults for you."<br/>"He doesn't insult me anymore, anyway."<br/>Nabiki nodded in agreement. "He doesn't, does  he? I wonder why?"<br/>Akane heard rather than saw the smirk on Nabiki's  face. "You're the expert on judging people, Nabiki, aren't you?"<br/>"That sounds harsh. I prefer to think that  I'm just good at understanding what they're <i>not</i> saying."<br/>"So what <i>isn't</i> Ranma saying?"<br/>"For starters, the meal certainly wasn't perfect.  It was obviously an improvement, but you're still not Kasumi, if you follow  what I'm saying."<br/>"<i>Nobody</i> could ever cook like Kasumi."<br/>"So what's for supper?"<br/>"I'm not sure yet. I'm trying to decide."<br/>"Want some advice?"<br/>"About <i>cooking</i>?"<br/>Nabiki shrugged. "There's a big difference  between knowing about something and actually doing it, little sister. It  would be a good idea for you to remember that."<br/>"So what else <i>isn't</i> Ranma saying?"<br/>Nabiki feigned ignorance. "About what?"<br/>Akane turned a little red. "About... you know..."<br/>"You'll have to be more descriptive than that,  I'm afraid..."<br/>Akane scowled as her face reddened further.  "About what Ranma thinks of me!"<br/>Nabiki smiled. "Oh, <i>that</i>. Well... that's  hard to say. Men can a little hard to read sometimes. But I'd say Ranma's  curious, if you catch my meaning. Still thinking of trying the shoe on?"<br/>The colour of Akane's face deepened even more.  "I wasn't talking about <i>that</i>! I just want to know..." she trailed  off, not trusting herself to finish the statement.<br/>"If he loves you?" Nabiki finished matter-of-factly.<br/>"Well... kinda... yeah..."<br/>"There's no reason to be ashamed of wanting  to know that."<br/>"R-really? You don't think so?"<br/>Nabiki waved aside the issue. "Of course not.  <i>Shoes</i> aside... it's only natural to wonder if you and him are on  the same wavelength."<br/>"So... what do you think?"<br/>Nabiki's eyebrows narrowed. "Well... I'll  make you a deal. You tell me the honest truth about how you feel about  him... and I'll tell you how to make good on it."<br/>Akane recoiled somewhat. "W-what is <i>that</i>  supposed to mean?"<br/>"There's no sense in me giving you all this  advice without knowing where you stand on it all."<br/>"Well... I... Ranma... he's been really nice  lately..."<br/>"But how do you <i>feel</i> about him?"<br/>"I don't know!"<br/>"If you don't know, then how can I help you?"<br/>"I... <i>like</i> him, I guess..." She  looked hopefully at Nabiki.<br/>Her sister shrugged. "Is that all? Well, in  that case, just keep working on the cooking. Good luck."<br/>"<i>Nabiki!</i>"<br/>Nabiki slid closer to Akane, her eyes fixing  Akane in her spot. "Little sister... I'm dead serious. If you only <i>like</i>  Ranma, then what point is there in me giving you romantic advice? I don't  think you quite appreciate what kind of advice I can give. I may not have  boyfriend or fiancee myself, but you'd better believe that I know about  relationships. I've been hired to both make and break them, and I'm quite  good at it. Like I said, there's a difference between knowing and doing  something. I think you'll be hard pressed to find anyone around who knows  about relationships better than I do."<br/>Akane looked away. "Why are you being so helpful  all of a sudden?"<br/>A smirk. "What? You expect that I'm going  to charge you for this help? Give me some credit, little sister. I draw  a line between family and business. I'll help you do whatever you want  with him. I can help you not fight each other. Or I can get you two naked  under the sheets. Or anything in-between. I've arranged it <i>all</i> before,  trust me."<br/>Nabiki turned Akane's face back to looking  at her own. "So what do you think? Are you sure that you only <i>like</i>  Ranma?"<br/>Akane lowered her head. "Well... I... guess...  I'm curious."<br/>"Go on."<br/>She swallowed. "I... guess... I'd like to  know if it... could all work out."<br/>Nabiki patted her sister on the back. "Very  good. That wasn't so hard to admit, was it? You like Ranma, and you're  curious about whether anything more serious could come of it, right?"<br/>Akane swallowed again. "Y-yes..."<br/>"Okay. No problem. So we've got you, then  we've got Ranma. On your side, we've got someone who's open to the idea  of romance, correct?"<br/>A nod.<br/>"And on the other hand, we've got Ranma."<br/>"What about Ranma?"<br/>"Well, you can't have a relationship with  only one person. It takes at least two. Let's think about what we're dealing  with. Ranma is the same age as you, also a martial artist, goes to the  same school, and lives under the same roof as you. Those are all good things.<br/>"On the bad side, you two have a history of  arguing, fighting and insulting each other. A rather long one, too. That's  not so good."<br/>"We haven't done any of that lately!"<br/>"That's a <i>good</i> thing. Keep doing that,  and you're halfway there."<br/>Akane looked doubtful. "You... really think  it's that easy?"<br/>Nabiki gave a knowing smile. "Akane... think  about it. We're talking about Ranma. He's got three other love interests,  and two of them are fairly sane, good-looking martial artists who are perfectly  willing to admit they love him and drape themselves over him. And then  he's got you, who he's always been fighting and arguing with. Yet  after all this time, he still hasn't gone for either of the other  two. <i>Why not?</i>"<br/>"I... don't know."<br/>"I think you might want to consider that he's  also curious. About you."<br/>Akane's heart sped up a few beats. "You...  think so?"<br/>"Why not? You're wondering whether or not  the relationship could work. I think he's also wondering about that too.  Maybe more than he'd ever admit. On one hand, he's got Ukyou or Shampoo.  On the other hand, he's got you. He hasn't made a choice, but he will.  Our strategy is simply going to be to make it very easy for him to choose  you."<br/>"How... will we do that?"<br/>Nabiki smiled. "Not too hard, little sister.  You've already got his interest. Now all you have to do is take advantage  of that. For starters, your cooking. Don't try anything harder yet. If  I wanted to get back into martial arts, I would start out at the bottom  right? If you want to improve your cooking, you've got to take it slow.  You can't build the castle until you've laid the foundation. And with every  meal that Ranma eats - even if it's not a ten course dinner - he'll be  reminded that you <i>can</i> cook, and are getting better all the time.  He's the type that appreciates determination, you'll find."<br/>Akane nodded. "So I shouldn't do anything  complicated yet."<br/>"Right. Next, I think you and him should go  out on a date."<br/>"<i>WHAT</i>!"<br/>Nabiki smiled. "Well, you don't have to <i>call</i>  it that. Perhaps we'll arrange for the two of you to go somewhere public  where you can both enjoy an event, and make a little small-talk on the  side."<br/>"Such as?"<br/>Two tickets were thrust in her face. "The  latest Jackie-Chan movie, presently sold out. And Ranma was too lazy to  wait in line, so he's going to have to wait months and months until it  comes out on video tape..."<br/>"How did <i>you</i> get these?"<br/>"I have my ways. But they're for tomorrow  night. Think Ranma would be interested?"<br/>"He'd kill for one of those."<br/>"Well, he doesn't have to kill anyone. All  he has to do is take you up on your offer to go see the movie with you.  You can each pay your own way for food on this one, and with this type  of movie, you don't have to worry about any mushy stuff."<br/>Akane swallowed. It <i>did</i> seem like a  good idea. It wasn't a date of course. Just... two people going to watch  a movie at the same time. Perfectly innocent.<br/>Nabiki voiced Akane's thoughts. "Perfectly  innocent for both for both of you, right? Yet it's a perfect chance for  you two to get a little more comfortable with each other."<br/>A slow nod. "And... we can even leave separately  so that daddy and Mr. Saotome don't know..."<br/>"You've got the idea. By incredible coincidence,  the Ucchan's and the Nekohaten will still be open. So you don't need to  worry about Ukyou or Shampoo coming around to interfere. Kunou and Kodachi  shouldn't be a problem, since both have a habit of going to bed early on  Sundays. Mousse would only wish you the best if he sees Ranma with anyone  aside from Shampoo."<br/>"That... makes sense."<br/>"Of course it does. I know a few things about  this type of business, you know."<br/>"You're <i>positive</i> this is all for free?"<br/>Nabiki smiled. "For my little sister, no charge.  I'll even throw in the tickets for this one. You can tell Ranma that you  won a bet against me. Just make the most of it, and I think you'll see  Ranma paying a little more attention to you, and a lot less towards anybody  else. Sound good?"<br/>Akane nodded again, aware that she was blushing.<br/>Nabiki stood up, heading towards the door.  "I thought it would. I suggest you ask Ranma after supper today. It'll  give him something to think about while he's training tonight. And the  more he thinks about you..." she let the thought trail off, quietly closing  the door behind her.<br/>Akane resumed lying back on her bed, exactly  as she had been a few minutes ago. But her thoughts were far from the same.  A date with Ranma? No, not a date. Just... an opportunity to test the waters.  To see if there was any possibility...<br/>She shivered slightly, but a soft smile was  on her face. Was there <i>really</i> a chance for something to happen?  Nabiki had sounded certain. When Nabiki was certain about something, she  was almost always right. And the explanation had made sense. And even if  things weren't perfect, what did she have to loose? She would have gotten  a free movie for the night, and she would know for certain about Ranma.<p>She <i>really</i> hoped things worked out.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Nabiki let out a satisfied smile as she headed  into her own room. So far, so good.<br/>She didn't pretend to understand everything  that had happened lately. But she knew a few things that Akane didn't.  Such as the fact that Ranma's recent good behaviour was largely an act.  And that he knew Akane was lying about something. That alone was a problem,  since Akane's present behaviour and interest towards him seemed to be genuine.  The situation was a powder keg, just waiting for a spark to set it off.<br/>But that didn't mean things were hopeless.  With some good advice and a little manipulation, she didn't think it was  that far-fetched to believe that some genuine understanding could come  of the recent cease-fire. With the surprising amount of patience they had  been giving each other lately, the atmosphere was as good as it was going  to get. The trick would be to bring about that 'genuine understanding'  before Ranma tried to directly confront Akane about whatever it was that  she was hiding.<br/>Or rather, the <i>real</i> trick was to get  <i>Akane</i> to do that.<br/>Yes, she had her work cut out for her.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"That make sense?"<br/>Akane took the paper full of mathematical  scribbling, noting the decided absence of doodling on it. Ranma's face  seemed surprisingly serious, compared to other instances she could remember.  It was possible that this was the first time he'd <i>ever</i> taken homework  seriously since arriving in Nerima. And it was with <i>her</i>...<br/>Realizing that Ranma was beginning to give  her a curious look, she quickly looked away, towards the paper. After a  moment... "No, you can't do that."<br/>"Do what?"<br/>"When you're differentiating exponential equations,  you have to remember that you can't work directly with them when both the  base and the exponent are variables. You have to break it down into something  else first."<br/>Ranma made a face. "Okay... so..." His forehead  screwed up in thought. "Use that logarithmic stuff to take it apart?"<br/>Akane nodded. "Right."<br/>"Okay. Lemme at it again."<br/>He took the paper from her, immediately resuming  his work. Akane looked at him with no small amount of amazement. Ranma...  was actually working on his homework. Would wonders never cease?<br/>But perhaps the most surprising thing was  the results. His knowledge was... spotty, she could tell. It was probably  an exact parallel to the amount of class time he'd slept through, really.  But even the past hour had shown amazing improvement. She had yet to explain  anything twice, and he was actually extrapolating from it at a rate that  would impress even Nabiki.<br/>Another way of looking at it would be to admit  that her justification for calling him an 'idiot' had one less leg to stand  on. It was perhaps fortunate that she hadn't had to call him that lately.  So why was he suddenly so willing to learn like this?<br/>A thought crossed her mind, from her discussion  with Nabiki. Was it possible... that Ranma really was curious? She could  name any number of times that various friends had gone out of their way  to tutor members of the opposite sex. Or to be tutored by them. Was it  possible that Ranma was using such a ploy himself?<br/>She played with the thought for a few moments.  She supposed it was possible... his sudden attentiveness could be explained  that way. Maybe he was trying to get on her good side more? Or maybe-<br/>"-Akane?"<br/>She blinked back to reality. "Um, yes?"<br/>"You okay?" Ranma asked, giving her a strange  look.<br/>She'd gotten distracted. With a mild blush,  Akane realized that she'd probably been staring right at him the whole  time. "Y-yes."<br/>"Does this look okay?"<br/>Akane took the sheet from him, quickly scanning  the calculations that Ranma had made during her zoning-out. "That's...  right."<br/>"Really? Great!"<br/>She rolled her eyes at him. "You must have  already learned it up in your sleep."<br/>Ranma quickly donned one of his trademark  arrogant smirks. "Well... guess I can do this stuff in my sleep!"<br/>"Next question," Akane decided, deliberately  pointing towards the longest question on the textbook page.<br/>The smirk quickly disappeared. "That's gonna  take me <i>years</i>!"<br/>"Too much to handle?" Akane challenged. Inwardly,  she knew he'd squirm his way out of it. In about five seconds, he was going  to announce that he had to go to the bathroom. It was inevitable, really.<br/>"Yeah, yeah, okay," Ranma agreed, taking up  a clean sheet of a paper.<br/>"Just hurry up," she admonished. She blinked  as Ranma's words finally registered. "What?"<br/>"I'm working as fast as I can," he muttered.<br/>Akane nodded. "I mean, yes. Good. I mean-"  She shut her mouth tightly before any more gibberish leaked out. It was  fortunate that Ranma seemed not to have noticed.<br/>She regarded his mask of concentration briefly.  It didn't seem quite... right. Ranma should have tried to avoid the issue.  He should have done just about anything <i>except</i> agree.<br/>Which gave credibility to the second possibility.  He was trying to score points with her through the Homework Tutor strategy.  But that didn't seem quite right. All the stories her friends had told  her about involved a half-hearted attempt at the work, alongside a whole-hearted  attempt at being over-friendly to the tutor. Whereas Ranma seemed unaware  she even existed at this moment in time. Strange.<br/>Then again, Ranma wasn't exactly an average  person to begin with. He'd spent most of his life training in martial arts.  Obsessing in the martial arts, really. With that kind of a mindset, maybe  he thought the best way to impress her would be to do likewise to his homework.<br/>She smiled. She wouldn't discourage that,  since it made homework much easier to do. But it was a good sign nonetheless.  Perhaps Nabiki's idea had some merit to it after all-<br/>"-Akane?"<br/>She recovered faster this time, thankful that  she hadn't been staring at him this time. "Yes?"<br/>"How's that?"<br/>Akane blinked. "You're done already?"<br/>Looking the sheet over for several moments  revealed a distinct lack of errors. And a <i>very </i>short solution to  boot. And to top it off, a correct answer. She looked at him. "What's this?"<br/>"I used that rule. The Hospital rule."<br/>"You mean 'l'Hospital's Rule'?"<br/>"Yeah, that one. But it works, doesn't it?"<br/>Akane blinked. "But... that's cheating!"<br/>"Why? I'd be at the problem all day if I didn't  use it."<br/>"Uh... well... I guess it's okay. I... didn't  expect you to do it that way." Heck, she'd never thought of doing it that  way before.<br/>"Well, you explained it before. You gotta  use everything technique you know! Just like Anything-Goes fighting."<br/>Akane smiled inwardly. Trust Ranma to apply  martial arts towards math homework. "Anything-Goes Mathematics?"<br/>Ranma didn't seem to have a problem with the  notion. "Sure. Why not? You mean, you did the question the long way?"<br/>Well, she <i>had</i>. Time for a quick topic  change. "By the way, I meant to ask you something, Ranma."<br/>"What?"<br/>"Are you busy tomorrow evening?"<br/>"Uh... I... don't think so. How come?"<br/>Akane rummaged through her drawer, producing  two pieces of paper that she held up to his face.<br/>Ranma read the writing, allowing a moment  of silence before letting his jaw hit the floor. "H-hey! Those're for the  latest Jackie Chan movie! How'd you get those?"<br/>Akane smiled. "I actually won a bet against  Nabiki for once. Anyway, most of my friends don't really like that kind  of movie. You feel like using the other ticket?"<br/>Ranma head nodded so fast it was almost a  blur. Then he caught himself. "Waaaait a minute... what's the catch?"<br/>"No catch. But this is the first time  I can remember really winning a bet against my sister, so I didn't want  the tickets to go to waste, right?"<br/>"Oh. Well, I mean... sure... this some kinda..."  He looked just a little suspicious. "Did our dads set this up or somethin'?"<br/>Akane made an honestly disgusted face. "No  way! And if you want this a ticket, you can't say <i>anything</i> to them  about it!"<br/><i>That</i> seemed to relax Ranma. He nodded  firmly. "Uh, right. Not a word to 'em."<br/>Akane nodded. So far so good. Ranma seemed  open to the idea, but not overwhelmingly happy. Perhaps Nabiki was right  when she suggested that Ranma felt the same way as her. Not actually in  love, just curious...<br/>"Meet me at the theatre at 7:00," she told  him. "If we leave separately, we don't have to put up with our fathers."<br/>"Gotcha. 7:00."<br/>Only twenty-two hours away, Akane noted, glancing  at the clock on her wall.<br/>Ranma followed her glance to the clock. His  eyes shot open. "Aw, geez! I lost track of the time! I gotta get training!"<br/>Akane nodded reluctantly. Really, Ranma's  father was such a slave-driver where training was concerned. "Well, okay.  7:00 tomorrow, right?"<br/>"Right. See ya there."<br/>Akane allowed herself a small smile as Ranma  bolted out the door. He'd forgotten to pack up his homework, he was in  such a rush. And there was precious little that could <i>ever</i> make  him concerned about punctuality. He must have <i>really</i> lost track  of the time.<br/>She giggled quietly as she lay back on her  bed. Maybe it had been <i>her</i> that had distracted him. Maybe.<br/>A knock on the door got her attention. Before  she could say anything, a folded piece of paper was pushed under the doorway,  followed by silence.<br/>Akane slid off her bed, retrieving the piece  of paper and opening it.<br/>'Good job, little sister. Have fun tomorrow  night.'<br/>Akane laughed quietly as she tossed the message  in the garbage. Trust her sister to listen in on the conversation. But  she would let it pass this time. Nabiki was on her side this time.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;">end part 4</p>
