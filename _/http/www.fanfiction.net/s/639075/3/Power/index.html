</div>        Valley of the Wind Productions presents...<br/>Power<br/>A Ranma 1/2 Fanfic by Intrasonic<p>&gt; brackets denote Chinese speech<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Part 3<hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Thank-you for buying Cat Cafe."<br/>Shampoo accepted the generous tip given to  her by the house's owner, deliberately ignoring the murderous glare the  owner's girlfriend was giving her. Was it her fault that she was so much  better-looking? If the girlfriend wanted to go through a lifetime of Amazon  training, she was welcome to it. But for her, physical fitness was only  a small benefit of the lifestyle she had been born into.<br/>Unburdened of her late afternoon delivery,  it was a simple matter for her to toss her bike into the air, leaping  up after it. A quick twist, and the bike had been set upon the fence, with  her as its rider, effortlessly maintaining the required balance. Travelling  by fence-top was faster and eliminated the danger posed by numerous stray  water sources. It was also a small source of practice during her otherwise  mundane workday.<br/>Despite her calm and carefree appearance,  she was anything but. She had deliberately taken a slightly longer route  back to the restaurant. One that happened to take her close to Furinken  High School, incidentally. But for once, she wasn't looking for her beloved.  Certainly it would nice to see him. To admire his beautifully sculpted  body with its graceful yet impossibly rugged nature. To gaze upon his face,  one that hadn't a care in the entire world. One that extruded an air of  confidence that dictated that no matter what opposition he went up against,  whether he _would_ triumph would never be an issue, only the matter of  _when_ being a variable.<br/>But she resigned herself to delaying that  for another time. Today, she was looking for someone else entirely. She  still hadn't understood why her Great-grandmother had grilled her last  night on the codes of the Amazon warrior.<br/>An Amazon does not run away. An Amazon does  not admit defeat. An Amazon does not surrender. An Amazon never yields  to an inferior. An Amazon fights to her last breath.<br/>It was the code that she had grown up on.  She believed and lived it with all her heart. And she _had_ been tested  on occasion. Amazon-to-Amazon fighting rarely went to such extreme, but  the wilderness of China had brought her close enough to dying on occasion  before, especially when she was younger and more brash. She was forced  to admit that while she was probably no less heedless now, she was much  more capable of taking care of herself.<br/>Did her Great-grandmother doubt her now? Shampoo  honestly wasn't sure. She loved her Great-grandmother with all her heart,  and didn't doubt the return of that love. But she was sometimes forced  to admit that the workings and the schemes of the old woman's mind were  beyond her. There had been numerous instances in the past where Cologne  had deliberately gone against her. Shampoo had matured from those instances,  and could now admit that they had been in her best interests. But they  were _never_ predictable. Like now, perhaps.<br/>Which was why she was looking for Akane Tendou.  Why she was supposed to encourage the girl to get in a fight was  beyond her. Did her Great-grandmother doubt her to the point where she  thought even _Akane_ could beat her? Shampoo shook her head, absent-mindedly  turning the fence corner with a graceful ease that defied what a bicycle  was ever meant to do. If that was all Cologne was worried about, Shampoo  would set her mind at rest soon enough.<br/>As soon as she happened to run into Akane,  anyway.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"See? You shouldn't have missed yesterday's  classes."<br/>"Well, I had to train!"<br/>"Is that all you think about?" Akane asked  in disbelief. "There's lots of things besides training, you know."<br/>Ranma shrugged. "I had to train."<br/>Akane bit her tongue. Honestly, Ranma was  so stubborn sometimes. Why couldn't he just accept his defeat? He could  beat everybody else, couldn't he? Was it that hard for him to accept that  there was one person who was capable of beating him?<br/>Ranma sucked in a breath. "Hey, Akane?"<br/>"Yes?"<br/>"I was wonderin'-"<br/>"Hey Akane!"<br/>Akane turned to face one of her friends. "Yuki?"<br/>"You still want to go see the movie?"<br/>Akane's face registered mild surprise. "I  forgot about that!"<br/>"Well? Are you coming? The movie starts in  ten minutes."<br/>Akane glanced at Ranma. "Catch up with you  later?"<br/>"Uh... sure, no prob," he agreed. "Catch ya  later."<br/>"You can come watch it with us if you want,"  Yuki invited. "Right, Akane?"<br/>Akane felt her throat close up as she struggled  to come up with a reply. She knew that her friend was deliberately trying  to set something up.<br/>Ranma was already answering. "T-that's okay,  Yuki. I gotta get home for training. Uh... enjoy the movie."<br/>"Well, okay," Yuki agreed, still smiling.  "Don't train too hard, right?"<br/>Ranma waved goodbye as he headed back to the  dojo.<br/>"I can't believe you!" Yuki exclaimed in disbelief.  "You could've had the cutest guy in the world escorting you to the movies!  But you went silent on me!"<br/>"It's nothing like that!" Akane protested.  "Besides, he hates those kind of movies! All he likes are martial arts  movies!"<br/>"It's different when a guy sees a romantic  movie with his girlfriend! It's a perfect excuse to cuddle up together!"<br/>Akane flushed. "We're not like that! Just  because he's finally started acting civil to me..."<br/>"So why can't you act civil and invite him  to a movie?"<br/>"Give it up, Yuki. We'll be late if we don't  get moving. I don't want to get stuck with a bad seat."<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Thank-you for buying Cat Cafe."<br/>Shampoo accepted the generous tip given to  her by the apartment's owner, expressing hope that he would enjoy his supper.  As the door closed before her, she was already leaving at a brisk pace.  Disdaining the slowness of the elevator, she instead<br/>exited at the nearest fire escape and jumped the four stories down  to land beside her bike.<br/>Over the handlebars of her bike, a sign was  draped over it, reading, "Belong to Shampoo". An effective anti-theft deterrent,  really. Anybody who even remotely knew of her would think twice before  laying a finger on something that belonged to an<br/>Amazon.<br/>It irked her that she hadn't yet found Akane.  How was she supposed to pick a fight with someone she couldn't even find?  It was not unlike her experiences when chasing Ranma's female form at first.  The redhead and her panda's trail would disappear for days on end. In retrospect,  she knew it was because they had managed to find hot water, but it had  been incredibly confusing for her at the time. So where was Akane now?<br/>Shaking her head, she headed back to the Nekohanten,  hoping that the next delivery would yield fruit for her search.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"That was _soooo_ romantic!"<br/>"I wish I had a boyfriend like that."<br/>"It doesn't happen in real life. That's why  we have to go to movies to see it."<br/>"I bet Ranma would come close..."<br/>Akane burst out laughing after a moment.<br/>Yuki looked mystified. "What?"<br/>Akane was still giggling. "The idea of Ranma...  doing _that_!"<br/>"What's so strange about it? Just imagine  it... 'Akane, my love, my soul could never hope to live apart from your  sweet presence...'"<br/>"Whatever!" Akane mocked. "It would probably  sound a little more like, 'Uh, Akane, you're um, pretty swell and all...'"<br/>Both girls laughed at her imitation of Ranma's  voice.<br/>"Just the same, wouldn't you love to hear  that?"<br/>"I don't know. Maybe I'll stick to going to  movies."<br/>"You're just saying that because he hasn't  said it yet. So when are you and Ranma going to go on your first _real_  date?"<br/>"Maybe never."<br/>"You can't fool me. You're thinking about  it, aren't you?"<br/>Akane flushed a little. "Maybe. But there's  no sense in rushing things. He's been acting really nice. I'm not going  to hurry things up. If it's good, then it's good."<br/>"You shouldn't act too timid. What with those  other fiancees..."<br/>Akane smiled. "That reminds me. I've got to  deal with Shampoo."<br/>"With _her_? But she'll..." Yuki trailed off.<br/>"Ranma can beat her. And I can beat Ranma,"  Akane reminded her. "Once she understands who's on top, I won't have anybody  interfering with me."<br/>"You mean, with you _and_ Ranma, right?"<br/>Akane smiled thinly. "You know what I mean."<br/>"Speak of the devil..." Yuki whispered, pointing.<br/>Akane looked down the street, her eyes narrowing.  "Shampoo..."<br/>"What's she doing down this way? I didn't  think the Nekohanten delivered in this part of town."<br/>"Well, no time like the present," Akane decided,  picking up a stray rock on the ground. "I think it's time to _deliver_  something to the Nekohanten..."<br/>With that, she wound up and heaved the rock  at the bicycle riding Amazon. It was a good throw, reminiscent of her track-record  in baseball. With an audible thump, it bounced off Shampoo's head, knocking  both her and her bike for a loop.<br/>Shampoo was barely able to grab the edge of  the fence, swinging her and her bike around to land on the dry ground.  By the time she had landed, she was already looking around for the source  of the rock.<br/>Akane smiled to Yuki. "See you tomorrow at  school?"<br/>Yuki was looking a little nervous. "Uh...  yeah. Tomorrow."<br/>"Hey, some things you just have to do if you  want some peace and quiet, right?"<br/>The other girl smiled at that. "Some peace  and quiet with _Ranma_, you mean."<br/>"You know what I mean."<br/>The girl nodded, turning off. "Tomorrow. Have  fun. Don't be too rough with her, right?"<br/>Akane didn't reply as she approached the Amazon.  It was payback time.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The instant the rock hit her in the head, Shampoo  had already begun to react. The first concern was to avoid falling into  the drainage ditch and getting wet. A firm hold on the fence top let her  swing herself around, her feet holding the bike so that she didn't have  trouble retrieving it later on.<br/>Touching down on the ground, she noticed the  rock out of the corner of her eye. Rather large. Whoever had displayed  the nerve to throw such a rock... she'd pound their face into the concrete  and maybe break the arm they'd used to throw it too!<br/>The thrower hadn't made any secret of who  they were. Shampoo's gaze quickly focussed on another girl coming towards  her with a smirk on her face. Akane. Shampoo blinked to make sure that  she wasn't mistaken. Akane had just picked a fight<br/>with _her_?<br/>No matter, Shampoo decided. At least it saved  her the trouble of picking a fight with Akane. It was really too bad for  Akane that an Amazon _never_ ran away from a fight.<br/>"Violent-girl have good reason before Shampoo  make eat ground?"<br/>Akane laughed quietly. "I was just a little  tired of seeing your ugly face around town, that's all. And I think that  Ranma needs a break from you. Good enough for you?"<br/>Yes, Akane was definitely picking a fight,  Shampoo decided, cracking her knuckles. "Violent-girl have bad memory?  She no touch Shampoo last time. She lucky Ranma save her."<br/>Akane looked around. "Oh dear, it looks like  Ranma isn't around. Too bad for you, because that means he won't be able  to save you. Before I knock you senseless, just let me warn you that I  won't be so nice if you come bothering me or Ranma a second<br/>time."<br/>Shampoo briefly looked around, but saw no  one nearby to back Akane up. "Violent-girl's head in clouds? Shampoo bring  down to ground again."<br/>Akane just laughed. "Then just try it, you  bimbo."<br/>Well, that made it official.<br/>Akane wasn't even prepared for the attack.  Shampoo lunged forwards, fist already aiming for Akane's face. Akane's  eyes opened wide in surprise.<br/>Then Shampoo felt an impact in her stomach,  knocking her sideways. Rolling, she got to her feet in time to see Akane  withdraw her fist. How had... she stood up, deciding that it was time to  take the challenge seriously. Akane shouldn't have gotten even _one_ hit  in, let alone that had knocked her down.<br/>"Tsk, tsk," Akane taunted. "You're really  slow today, Shampoo? Something wrong?"<br/>"Violent-girl not walk for week when Shampoo  done with!"<br/>"Just try it, Amazon!"<br/>Shampoo tried.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>**SMASH**<br/>Shampoo gagged as she staggered to her feet  again. She didn't understand what was happening. The stupid, slow, temperamental  girl that she had always been able to dance circles around was... winning.<br/>_An Amazon does not admit defeat._<br/>No, Akane was not winning. She merely had  the advantage right now, Shampoo corrected, facing off her opponent. Her  entire body was screaming in pain now. Several gouges and cracks in the  pavement attested as to the reasons.<br/>"Still standing?" Akane laughed.<br/>"You never beat Shampoo!"<br/>"That's what I'm doing now, isn't-"<br/>Even while Akane had been replying, Shampoo  had taken advantage of the distraction. Ignoring the protests her body  sent her brain, she darted forwards. Skirting around just outside Akane's  reach, she flipped forwards, planting her hands on the ground and using  the leverage to whip her leg around.<br/>Akane, who had moved her gaze to follow Shampoo's  hands, never saw the kick coming for her head. It struck solidly, knocking  her back a step. But that was it.<br/>She shook her head and regarded the Amazon  with distaste. "Is that the best you can do? That didn't even hurt a bit!"<br/>Shampoo allowed herself to feel a small amount  of worry. Even someone like Ranma would have been sent reeling from such  a kick. But Akane had only been knocked back a step. How on Earth...<br/>"Give it up before I really have to hurt you,"  Akane suggested.<br/>_An Amazon does not surrender._<br/>"Shampoo not beat yet!"<br/>"I'm getting bored of this," Akane decided.  "Time to put you down for good!"<br/>Shampoo never even had a chance to dodge.  In the blink on an eye, Akane had crossed the distance between them and  dealt a hard blow across Shampoo's face that sent the Amazon reeling.<br/>Shampoo got to her feet again, only to receive  another hit to the stomach that staggered her backwards. Another hit to  the shoulder. Her body was screaming in pain. How was Akane so fast and  strong? An uppercut to the chin. It wasn't possible...<br/>_An Amazon does not yield to an inferior._<br/>The next blow struck her just above the chest,  knocking her right off her feet, hard enough for her to leave an impression  in the wall behind her. Shampoo began to slump to the ground, only sheer  will enabling her to stop the descent and stand up again, using the wall  for support.<br/>Akane closed the distance between them, looking  the Amazon in the face, her expression clearly mocking. "Well? Not so smart  now, are you? Ready to give up yet?"<br/>Shampoo could taste blood in her mouth. She  swallowed, her jaw aching beyond description, yet only a shadow of what  the rest of her body was feeling. Her vision was getting blurry...<br/>Akane's left hand pinned Shampoo against the  wall by her neck. "_Well?_ Say 'Akane, I give up'. Go ahead... say it."<br/>_An Amazon fights to her last breath._<br/>Shampoo tried to make her mouth work, but  it didn't want to respond to her demands. Her entire body was in a similar  state.<br/>"I can't hear anything," Akane growled, drawing  back her right hand in a fist.<br/>Finally, her mouth obeyed her commands. Taking  a deep breath, Shampoo opened her mouth.<br/>Akane recoiled as something wet splashed over  her face. Touching it gingerly, her hand came away red. That... Amazon  had just spit _blood_ on her, she realized, her face growing red.<br/>Shampoo smiled mockingly, ignoring the pain  the motion ignited in her. "Am-zon... ne-ver... su-ren-der..."<br/>"Be that way," Akane agreed, her right fist  beginning to move...<br/>Mercifully, the last spike of pain that Shampoo  felt also brought darkness with it.<br/>Akane sighed in mock-disappointment, letting  the body slump to the ground. "Not so tough now, are you, you stupid bimbo?"<br/>Without another word, she turned and left  for home, pausing only to wipe her face clean. Now that Shampoo had gotten  the message, she would be free to take things with Ranma at her own pace.  Things were just peachy these days, she decided.<p>Even as she rounded the corner, a small figure  landed noiselessly on the ground next to Shampoo. Looking the unconscious  and bleeding girl over with a careful eye, a grunt of satisfaction was  emitted.<br/>"Well done, Great-granddaughter. Well done,  indeed."<br/>Without another word, Cologne hefted Shampoo's  inert form over her shoulder and began to head back to the restaurant.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"I'm home!"<br/>"Hello, Akane," Kasumi greeted. "How was the  movie?"<br/>"It was really good. By the way, I cut myself  today and got some blood on my blouse."<br/>"Oh my," Kasumi observed, taking Akane's jacket.  "Are you okay?"<br/>"I'm fine," Akane assured her older sister.<br/>"Nasty cut, I'd say," Nabiki observed, suddenly  behind and looking at the blood stain on Akane's school uniform. "What  did you do? Lean on a knife?"<br/>"None of your business."<br/>"You've got some blood on your face too,"  Nabiki pointed out.<br/>Akane's eyes opened wide as she quickly wiped  her face.<br/>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "Ah ha! So there  _was_ blood on your face, I see."<br/>Akane realized that her sleeve had come up  dry. "Why you-"<br/>"So who'd you beat up?"<br/>"That's none of-" Akane's eyes narrowed as  she saw her sister's widening smile. "I mean, what makes you think that  I-"<br/>"I thought so. So who'd you beat up? Shampoo?"<br/>"I didn't-"<br/>"I thought so."<br/>Akane glared at Nabiki. "Do you mind?"<br/>"I'm just asking how your day went, little  sister," Nabiki protested innocently. "Are you telling me that you're _ashamed_  or something...?"<br/>"NO!"<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>NO! &gt;<br/>Cologne regarded the surprisingly defiant  individual. No, _what_? &gt;<br/>The bruised and ragged figure in the bed regarded  her stonily. No, you will _not_ tell Ranma! &gt;<br/>Why not? &gt;<br/>Shampoo's fists clenched, accidentally shattering  the cup of juice she had been drinking. Because I'd sooner DIE than  let him see me like this! &gt;<br/>Tsk, tsk. So you lost miserably to little  Akane Tendou. What's so bad about that? &gt;<br/>Cologne ducked as the remnants of the glass  flew over her head to shatter further against the far wall.<br/>I'll kill her! I'll tear her limb from  limb! &gt;<br/>Cologne shook her head. But why? You  weren't this mad before you left to chase after Ranma's female form. &gt;<br/>That was different! He-she... was a good  fighter! But Akane... &gt;<br/>What about her? &gt;<br/>The life seemed to seep from Shampoo as she  slumped down under her bedcovers, all her injuries complaining anew to  her. How can I face Ranma after this? Me, a proud Amazon warrior,  defeated by that little... _upstart_.&gt;<br/>Cologne sighed, laying a hand on Shampoo's  arm, careful not to touch any of the bandages. "Come now, Great-granddaughter.  I watched you face down Akane with resolve that would make our ancestors  proud. To the very end, you refused to back down. Where is that determination  now?"<br/>Shampoo said nothing.<br/>"Do you love Ranma?" Cologne asked.<br/>A nod.<br/>"What do you love about him?"<br/>"Everything."<br/>"_Everything_? Even though he's an insensitive  jerk who doesn't care about others?"<br/>"_THAT A LIE!_"<br/>Cologne smirked. "Prove it. I'm going to let  Ranma know about this. If he's as you seem to think..."<br/>Shampoo glowered. "Great-grandmother wrong!  Ranma very nice!"<br/>"Well, since you seem so sure of it, see you  later."<br/>"WAIT!"<br/>Too late, Cologne had already left the room.  Shampoo sunk down even further, face already beginning to burn with shame.  She would kill her Great-grandmother for this. She couldn't even move out  of the bed right now. Her hair was still matted with blood and her entire  body was lined with gashes and bruises, each one aching to the point where  she couldn't even move. Apparently she had a few fractures in her legs,  so she didn't dare try to walk anywhere. And she had been completely undressed  to tend to the wounds, so there was no way she could leave the restaurant.  And to have Ranma see her this way...<br/>She would make her Great-grandmother pay for  this, she vowed.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The sign to the bathroom door had been flipped  to indicate occupancy, but Nabiki pushed the door open anyway, noiselessly  positioning herself on the back side of the dividing panel.<br/>"Still been training hard, Saotome?" she inquired.<br/>A brief choke indicated that Ranma hadn't  noticed her presence before. "Nabiki? What are-"<br/>She shut the door behind her. "You certainly  seem to be putting a lot of time in training, you know."<br/>"I already told you! A martial artist-"<br/>"-must rise to every challenge, I know," she  agreed. "You told me that already. But I seem to get the impression that  you're trying to get on my little sister's good side. Why, you're so polite  that I'd swear the real Ranma's been replaced by his good-<br/>twin."<br/>"Har har. None of your business."<br/>"But you _have_ been rather... nice to Akane  lately, haven't you?"<br/>"So? What if I have? Just actin' polite."<br/>"Of course. That must be it."<br/>**SPLASH**<br/>"Hey! What are ya' doing?"<br/>Nabiki raised an eyebrow as the sounds of  commotion filtered through the dividing wall. What was going on?<br/>"Good evening, Son-in-Law. I'm not disturbing  anything, I hope?"<br/>"Do you _mind_? I'm havin' a bath!"<br/>Nabiki's face screwed up in a strange smile.  My, but this was looking interesting...<br/>"I can see that much."<br/>"Well, GET LOST!"<br/>Nabiki pushed aside the screen, entering the  bath portion of the room. "Why, hello Cologne. Nice to see you."<br/>"Hey!" Ranma protested, immediately trying  to sink even lower into the tub.<br/>"Nice to see you too, Nabiki Tendou. I wasn't  interrupting anything, was I?"<br/>"Darn right you were!" Ranma growled.<br/>Nabiki nodded. "He's right, you know. Ranma  and I have been having a secret affair for some time now. It seems that  the only time we can be alone together is when he has a bath."<br/>Ranma's eyes shot open in disbelief. "Wha-HEY!"<br/>"Well, I can't say I blame you," Cologne agreed  soberly. "He's certainly a... well-built young man. I wish you two the  best."<br/>"Now just a darn minute here-"<br/>Nabiki kept her expression neutral. "Thank-you.  I think it could work. But honestly, Ranma. What's she doing here? Have  you been seeing her behind my back?"<br/>Ranma's face began to take on a sick shade  of green.<br/>Cologne took no notice. "Well, my Great-granddaughter  has said that she doesn't mind sharing him..."<br/>Ranma began to sink into the water, prompting  both females to burst out laughing at him.<br/>"You're such a tease, Ranma," Nabiki mocked.<br/>"Indeed you are, Son-in-law," Cologne cackled.<br/>Ranma recovered enough to leap out of the  tub and wrap his towel around himself. He glared daggers at them both.  "Do you two mind?"<br/>"I won't keep you long," Cologne assured him.  "I simply wanted to ask a favor of you, that's all."<br/>"A favor?" Ranma looked at her as if she'd  grown a second and third head.<br/>"Yes, a favor. Put simply, since you seem  to be on such good terms with Akane Tendou, I was wondering if you would  talk to her for me. I don't quite approve of her abusing my Great-granddaughter  as such."<br/>"What?"<br/>"Akane beat Shampoo up today," Nabiki filled  in.<br/>Cologne nodded. "I don't mind some friendly  fighting between fellow martial artists, but one has to draw the line somewhere."<br/>Ranma tensed up. "Akane... beat up Shampoo?"<br/>"And for once, my Great-granddaughter didn't  start the fight," Cologne confirmed grimly.<br/>"Is... Shampoo okay?"<br/>"Well... I'm afraid that Akane worked her  over rather... _severely_."<br/>Ranma's expression looked rather scared. Obviously,  he fully remembered how well he'd done against Akane. "Oh man... is Shampoo  gonna be okay?"<br/>"She should be alright in a few days."<br/>"A few _days_?"<br/>Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "I thought you martial  artists always healed overnight or something like that?"<br/>"We _DO!_" Ranma exclaimed. "How bad did  Akane..."<br/>Cologne looked a little downcast. "I'm afraid  that my Great-granddaughter never was the type to stay down after being  hit..."<br/>A rush of wind was all that Nabiki saw as  Ranma rushed out the bathroom door. A moment of silence ensued between  the two remaining occupants of the bathroom.<br/>"I didn't realize that he would go look for  Akane so quickly," Cologne observed in surprise.<br/>"Go figure," Nabiki agreed. "He sure took  that hard."<br/>The slamming of the front door informed them  otherwise.<br/>"Oh dear," Cologne muttered. "Maybe he's not  going after Akane after all. I don't think Shampoo is going to be in the  mood for company... until later, Tendou."<br/>"See you around," Nabiki agreed, eyes narrowing.  Did Cologne take her for an naïve idiot? If there was anything she'd  learned about the old Amazon, it was that _nothing_ ever surprised her.  And no mention about a Kiss of Death?<br/>She frowned, leaving the bathroom. Cologne  requesting protection for Shampoo? That didn't fit with anything that she  knew about Amazons and their rather over-inflated sense of pride. It was  one thing when Akane made a laughingstock of Ranma.<br/>But if Akane had actually gone so far as to pick a fight with Shampoo...<br/>She scowled. This whole business was completely  wrong. And it irked her that she didn't yet know why.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>A knock sounded at the door.<br/>Shampoo huddled under the covers. "Great-grandmother?"<br/>"Hey, Shampoo?"<br/>Damn. It _would_ be him, she cursed, wishing  a colourful array of plagues and disasters to befall her Great-grandmother  in the near future.<br/>"Hey, you in there?"<br/>She kept silent.<br/>"Uh... I'm, uh, coming in, okay?"<br/>In tandem with the declaration, the door creaked  open.<br/>An implement hummed through the air, embedding  itself in the wall with an audible thump. By this time, Ranma was  already bent over backwards, now staring upwards at the comb.<br/>"Uh, I..." Having a comb thrown at you hard  enough to go into the wall usually meant you weren't welcome, he mentally  decided.<br/>"Go!" the muffled voice yelled from under  the covers.<br/>"I just wanna know if you're okay!" Ranma  protested.<br/>"I fine!"<br/>"The Ol' Ghoul said you weren't gonna be okay  for a few days! That Tomboy musta done somethin' bad!"<br/>"Go!"<br/>"Geez, how come you gotta be so stubborn!"  Ranma muttered, coming up to the Shampoo-sized lump formed under the covers.  A stray tail of blue hair hadn't quite made it under the covers with its  owner. And it was covered in blood. There was also a pile of bandages and  wrappings in the wastebasket, all with a sizeable amount of blood on them.<br/>"Oh my..." Ranma's eyes shot open as the smell  of antiseptic finally reached his nostrils. "WHAT THE HECK DID SHE _DO_?"<br/>Without any further ado, he yanked the covers  off the bed. "How bad are you-URK!"<br/>The fist caught him straight in the forehead,  knocking him off his feet.<br/>"I'm sorry!" Ranma apologized, covering his  eyes. "I didn't see nothin'!"<br/>Shampoo could already feel tears coming to  her eyes as she saw him frantically covering his eyes. She must look absolutely  terrible for him to deny it so forcefully. A proud Amazon warrior brought  so low... damn her Great-grandmother and her<br/>wretched ideas...<br/>"I didn't see nothin'!" Ranma was still protesting.  "I didn't see you naked or- I mean, I didn't know that you were-I mean...  I'm sorry!"<br/>Shampoo stared at him in disbelief and looked  back in the mirror. Then she began to smile. The idiot. The complete idiot.  He didn't understand anything, as usual.<br/>"_Why_ you sorry?" she asked dangerously.<br/>"I dunno! Whatever you want me to be sorry  for!"<br/>Shampoo began to laugh quietly as she lay  back down on the bed. "Ranma idiot," she whispered. "Ranma big idiot."<br/>"Uh... okay," Ranma was agreeing, his back  still turned. "Are you... uh, still mad?"<br/>"Shampoo not mad."<br/>Ranma sighed in relief, rubbing his forehead  where he'd been hit. "Whew! That's good-URK! Put somethin' on!"<br/>She hadn't gotten under the covers yet, Shampoo  realized. Ranma could be such a prude in his own charming little way, she  decided, slipping under the covers. "Shampoo under blanket now."<br/>Ranma looked back cautiously. "Uh, that's  good. Uh, you're not gonna hit me again? I got 'nuff problems with that  from Akane."<br/>"Shampoo no hit."<br/>He sighed with relief, cautiously taking a  step or two closer. "You okay? The Ol' Ghoul said you got it pretty  bad."<br/>Shampoo felt her shame welling up all over  again. "Shampoo... lose to... Violent-girl bad..."<br/>"No kidding. I didn't think Akane would do  somethin' like that. I mean, she never went that far when she was fightin'  with me. I gotta beat her quick..."<br/>Shampoo stared at him. "Ranma... always beat  Akane?"<br/>Ranma turned red. "Uh... Akane's gotten way  stronger all of a sudden..."<br/>"Akane beat Ranma too..."<br/>"Well, uh... kinda, yeah. But not for long.  Ranma Saotome never loses a fight and he ain't gonna lose this one..."  He cut his battle declaration short as he saw tears beginning to come from  Shampoo's eyes. "Hey, what's wrong-HEY! What're ya<br/>doin'? Stop that-ACK!"<br/>Shampoo had grabbed Ranma in a bear hug and  was squeezing for all she was worth. "Shampoo thought she lose! Shampoo  thought she disgrace to Amazons!"<br/>Ranma tried to pry her away, but couldn't  seem to find anything safe to push on. That option extinguished, he held  his hands behind him as far as he could. "Uh... yeah, I guess you didn't  know that Akane's real strong now..."<br/>"Shampoo so happy!"<br/>Ranma could feel his lungs being compressed.  "H-hey... don't you gotta rest?"<br/>"Shampoo not care!"<br/>"B-but... I can't... breath!"<br/>"Shampoo not care- wait, Shampoo _do_ care  Ranma breath. Why he not say before?"<br/>Ranma sucked in several welcome lung-fulls  of air as he was released. His body had been taking a lot of abuse lately,  he reflected. If it wasn't being pounded on by over-powered Tomboys, it  was being crushed by naked Amazons- "... put some clothes on!"<br/>"Shampoo sorry. She just so happy now..."<br/>"Uh... yeah."<br/>Shampoo looked up at Ranma curiously. "Why  Akane so strong?"<br/>Ranma shrugged, just relieved that things  had calmed down. "I dunno. She says that she was just hidin' it before.  But she's lying."<br/>"Akane eat Super Soba noodle?"<br/>"Already gave her the antidote. Didn't work.  But she'd got no control and she can't anticipate my moves. I've fought  her a few times now."<br/>Shampoo nodded. "Shampoo fool Violent-girl  many time in fight... but she too fast!"<br/>"Right!" Ranma agreed. "So she's got something  makin' her stronger! I just gotta find out what it is and she'll be her  old self again!"<br/>_That_ was the Ranma she loved, Shampoo reflected.  He'd repeatedly challenged Akane and lost, but was still expecting to win.  How could she do less? "Shampoo help."<br/>Ranma looked worried. "But you're all messed  up!"<br/>"Shampoo be good in two days, Great-grandmother  say!"<br/>"Well, I guess you can help a little... but  I don't want you getting' hurt-ACK!"<br/>Shampoo held Ranma firmly by his neck. "You  insult Amazon? Amazon _never_ afraid get hurt! You say Shampoo weak?"<br/>"W-well... right now..."<br/>The hand tightened slightly. "Shampoo help!  Is good?"<br/>When an Amazon has her hand wrapped your neck,  there's only one correct answer. Ranma guessed it this time. "Is good!"<br/>"Shampoo so happy! She get better fast and  help Ranma!"<br/>Ranma nodded, massaging his throat gingerly.  "So... uh, I guess I'll let you rest. I'll get working on beatin' Akane  and soon's you're okay, you can help out."<br/>Shampoo smiled. "Is good. "<br/>Closing the door behind him, Ranma found himself  face to face with the older female Amazon. "Old Ghoul."<br/>"Son-in-Law. So you actually agreed to let  my Great-granddaughter help you out. Most amazing."<br/>Well, it was either that or lose the ability  to breath, Ranma wanted to say. "She seemed okay to me. I mean, except  for the blood and stuff..."<br/>Cologne shook her head. "Adrenaline rush,  I suspect. Foolish young girl. She'll feel it doubly so tonight. Based  on her injuries, I surmise that Akane Tendou was none too picky about where  she hit. Shampoo says that Akane attempted to execute what your style calls  'The Camel's Two Humps'."<br/>Ranma's face darkened. The move was generally  consider taboo, since it basically involved planting one's heel right  in the middle of the opponent's spine as hard as possible. "Akane did _that_?"<br/>"Shampoo has seen the move before and was  able to get away with only a cracked rib."<br/>"Shampoo's gonna be okay?"<br/>"Fortunately, Akane Tendou doesn't use weapons.  I imagine that my Great-granddaughter will get by without even a scar in  a few days. Luck of the Gods, I think. But do you think you could ask her  to leave Shampoo alone?"<br/>"Maybe Shampoo should just stay away from  the Tendou place. I'll, uh... find another place to practice with her."<br/>"A wise idea. I suspect you and her should  be able to do a great deal towards enhancing your skills. I'm afraid that  I can't help you at this time."<br/>Ranma sighed. "Well... keep looking, I guess.  Me and Shampoo will just have to get good enough to beat her."<br/>"I wish you two luck. I would deal with this  myself, but Amazons laws prohibit me actually fighting Akane Tendou, unless  she attacks me first."<br/>"Don't even bother," Ranma declared. "Akane's  just gotten way stronger and faster. Me and Shampoo are both way more skilled,  and we'll take her down if it's the last thing we do!"<br/>Cologne chuckled as the boy left the restaurant.  She could never quite decide which was greater: Ranma's skill or his arrogance.  But she had to admit, the combination of the two always made things interesting.<br/>Pushing open the door to Shampoo's room, she  eased over to the younger's bed.<br/>"Great-granddaughter?"<br/>"Yes, Great-grandmother?"<br/>"How are you feeling?"<br/>"More bad than before."<br/>"That's what you get for jumping around like  a fool while injured like that."<br/>"Shampoo better in few days."<br/>"I don't doubt it. And then you have a great  deal of training to do, you realize. You are extremely good. But Son-in-Law  is much better. If you want to work with him, you'll have to be willing  to earn that right."<br/>"Shampoo earn."<br/>Are you still angry with me for telling  Son-in-Law about what happened to you? &gt;<br/>Not anymore. &gt;<br/>So you take back all the curses I heard  you wishing on me before? &gt;<br/>Shampoo flushed. You heard that? &gt;<br/>I heard everything. He's really is unbelievably  dense sometimes. &gt;<br/>She laughed weakly. He is. I was overcome  with humiliation over my defeat, and all he was concerned about was that  I wasn't wearing any clothes. &gt;<br/>Any Amazon male might think of things  like that. But he has a completely different mentality. That was because  you had no reason to be humiliated. You could learn something from him.  He's been challenging her every night without success. And<br/>yet he doesn't even consider the idea of losing. Many Amazons thinks  that a true warrior never loses a battle. Whereas Ranma simply trains harder  for the rematch. &gt;<br/>I will take some time off from my job.  &gt;<br/>Cologne raised an eyebrow. Isn't that  a little extreme? &gt;<br/>Shampoo shook her head. If I am to be  a worthy partner, I must catch up to him before I can keep pace with him.  &gt;<br/>I'm glad you understand. I think this  restaurant can afford to stay closed for a week. I hope you make the most  of it. &gt;<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The sign to the bathroom door had been flipped  to indicate occupancy, but Nabiki pushed the door open anyway, noiselessly  positioning herself on the back side of the dividing panel.<br/>"Hi, Nabiki."<br/>She smirked. "Goodness. I must be losing my  touch."<br/>"I'm a martial artist. You're quiet, but I  know how you sound now."<br/>"Give yourself a pat on the back, Saotome."<br/>"So what do you want now?"<br/>"Just curious how Shampoo's doing."<br/>"She'll get better."<br/>"My, that sounds pretty serious."<br/>Ranma didn't reply.<br/>"So? How badly did my little sister work our  favourite Amazon over?"<br/>"None of your business, Nabiki. Why dontcha  go ask her yourself?"<br/>"Because I want to walk tomorrow, and I'm  not stupid enough to walk up and ask that to an Amazon with a wounded pride."<br/>Ranma sucked in his breath. "Whoa... so _that's_  why she got so mad..."<br/>She sighed. "_Brilliant_ Saotome. Ladies'  man, _my foot_."<br/>"Hey! I got more of 'em chasing me than you  ever will!"<br/>Nabiki's smirked. "Think carefully, Ranma,  about what you just said."<br/>He coughed, evidently having realized it himself.  "Uh... I mean... I got more girls chasing me than you got guys chasin'  you!"<br/>"You've also got more _guys_ chasing you,  I'd like to point out."<br/>Ranma coughed again. "Hey! That was cheap!"<br/>Nabiki laughed quietly as she left the bathroom.  "Really, Saotome! If you haven't learned better by now..."<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"I'm proud of you, boy!"<br/>"Yeah, yeah, whatever, pop."<br/>Akane looked at the two in confusion. Aside  from the relative respect being shown... "You're _still_ training?"<br/>"That's right!" Genma agreed enthusiastically.  "He's a Saotome to the core! He feels that the owes it to his fiancee to  try and be worthy of her skill."<br/>Ranma grunted and continued eating his meal.<br/>Akane smirked. "Oh come now, Ranma, that's  so nice of you. But why are you training somewhere else?"<br/>"True training cannot be done in a dojo,"  Genma replied, as though bestowing great wisdom upon everyone present.  "It must be done in the openness and vastness of the world. A martial artist  who wishes to fight in the world must also train in the world!"<br/>Nabiki clapped a few times. "Very inspiring,  Uncle Saotome. Maybe you should have been a politician."<br/>"I'll keep that in mind," the man promised,  somehow letting the point completely escape him.<br/>"Anyway, I gotta go," Ranma announced, standing  up from the table.<br/>"Train your hardest, boy! Make your father  proud!"<br/>"Like I'd even care about _that_!" Ranma retorted  as disappeared from the room.<br/>Nabiki watched him go. "My, Akane. He sure  is trying hard to impress you, isn't he?"<br/>Akane looked thoughtful. "You think so?"<br/>"Of course he is!" Soun opinioned. "Such a  well-meaning fiancé. You must be very happy, Akane!"<br/>"Uh... yeah, I guess so..." she agreed, leaving  the room with her dishes.<br/>Nabiki just shook her head. Now _that_ was  as conclusive as any judge and jury. It seemed that Akane really was taking  an interest in Ranma. It was a pity that he seemed to have other motives.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Punch. Kick. Twist. Jump. Kick. Jump and kick.  Spin. Spin and kick and twist and leap and block and slide and chop-<br/>Recover.<br/>Ranma touched down on the ground, breathing  heavily. Virtually flawless in execution, yet somehow completely useless  against his latest opponent. He needed to be faster. Stronger. More agile.  More resilient. More powerful.<br/>Better.<br/>And nothing short of pushing himself beyond  his limits would do that. Maybe he could convince Cologne to spar with  him. She would push him beyond his limits with little hesitation. Of course,  she'd probably try to stick him with some deal about him marrying Shampoo,  and that wasn't what he needed right now.<br/>He still wasn't sure why he'd even agreed  to work with Shampoo. The fact that she'd had a hand clamped around his  neck had been the immediate reason, of course. But the heir to the Anything-Goes  school shouldn't have to get other people to help them win their fights.  When he beat Akane, he wanted to beat her on his own, not in a two-on-one  fight.<br/>Not that Shampoo wasn't a good martial artist.  Ranma was a good enough judge to guess that she'd lay waste to any of his  other fiancees in a real fight. She was probably skilled in more weapons  than even he was, on account of her Amazon heritage. She was certainly  far above Akane's skill level. But she was also below his level, and he  needed somebody who was good enough to really make him strain. Ryouga would  have been nice around now. Or Tarou. Even Happousai would be welcome as  a sparring partner. But Shampoo? She just fell a little short of his caliber  of fighting.<br/>Besides, she was a _girl_. And Ranma Saotome  _didn't_ fight girls.<br/>"What you do out here?"<br/>"Gah!" Ranma froze for a moment as the voice  caught him by surprise.<br/>"Why Ranma scared?"<br/>Ranma spun around to face the accusation.  "I ain't scareda nothing! What are you doin' out here, Shampoo?"<br/>The Amazon still looked a mess, and walked  with a visible limp. But the blood had been cleaned off of her, so she  didn't look nearly as bad as she had before. "Great-grandmother say okay  for Shampoo to try find place to practice. She not know Ranma already find."<br/>"Well, 'kane doesn't know about this place,"  Ranma replied offhandedly. "And it's got more room than the dojo. And the  trees are kinda nice for mid-air practice. A real martial artist doesn't  _need_ a dojo!"<br/>"Great-grandmother say too," Shampoo agreed.  "That why Amazon never make building for practice. Ranma practice now?"<br/>"Well, yeah. I mean, you're too messed up  right now, but I gotta keep practising."<br/>"Is good," Shampoo agreed. "Okay, Shampoo  watch?"<br/>Ranma frowned somewhat. "Well..."<br/>"Shampoo leg very sore. Need rest before walk  home again."<br/>"Alright, alright. Go ahead and watch."<br/>Shampoo smiled and nodded, finding a tree  stump and sitting down on it. It wasn't too often that she got a chance  to watch her beloved practice. What she saw mostly was him defending himself  against Mousse, who was most certainly an inferior<br/>opponent. But now, she knew that Ranma would be pushing himself to  his limits<br/>Making a rather strained effort to ignore  the fact that someone was watching, Ranma positioned himself in a combat  stance in the middle of the clearing. Moving his arms in a slow windmill-like  pattern, he began to move forwards in a pattern which<br/>Shampoo immediately grasped. Not complicated at all, though done with  exceptional smoothness on her beloved's part.<br/>After several moments, he began to increase  the speed of his movements, yet keeping them just as precise and defined  as ever. His face was still calm, suggesting that he was exerting himself  only slightly beyond a brief walk. Even now, he had yet to<br/>initiate anything resembling an attack.<br/>Gradually, his movements began to metamorph  into punches and kicks, each one possessing a formidable mixture of blinding  quickness and minute precision. Yet still he continued to increase the  speed at which he carried them out.<br/>Shampoo soon found herself mesmerized by the  sheer power behind his actions. At times, his arms and legs would fade  into a blur of red and blue streaks as her eyes were no longer able to  register the speed of his attacks. At other times, he would almost  seem to slow to a statue, frozen in a position that should never be feasible.  Then, as smoothly as he had halted, he would accelerate into a frenzy of  chops and spins that seemed almost to keep him aloft of the ground indefinitely.<br/>And then he would touch down, using the brief  contact with the earth to completely redefine his momentum, engaging in  another maelstrom flurry of fist and foot.<br/>Unable to do anything else, Shampoo simply  watched.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>It was almost an hour later that Ranma came  to a halt in the centre of the clearing, touching down silently upon his  left foot before reverting to a more casual stance.<br/>Shampoo sucked in a breath, the motions of  the past hour still vivid in her mind. Only now was it occurring to her  the magnitude of what had been done. Ranma's performance was years beyond  anything she would have been capable of.<br/>"That... much good," she whispered, her Japanese  failing to provide any better adjective for the moment.<br/>All at once, the life seemed to seep out of  Ranma as he sank to his knees, panting heavily.<br/>Briefly heedless of her own injuries, Shampoo  was at his side. "Ranma okay?"<br/>Ranma sank down until he was lying on his  back. His clothing was literally dripping with sweat as he sucked in gasps  of air. "F-fine... be okay... in few minutes..."<br/>"Ranma lie?"<br/>"Honest... just gimme... a few minutes..."<br/>Looking doubtful, but deciding not to argue,  Shampoo say down next to him to wait a few minutes. "Where you learn?"<br/>"Learn... what?"<br/>"What you just do."<br/>"I dunno. Just... made it... up... as I went..."<br/>"You make up? You lie! It look too-too good.  Ranma do much practice before!"<br/>Ranma seemed to have recovered enough to sit  up. "No, I didn't! If it was a pattern, then it wouldn't be much good in  a fight. A master of the Anything-Goes style has to make things up as they  go!"<br/>Shampoo realized that he was being serious.  She sighed, lowering her head. "Great-grandmother teach Shampoo many thing.  But she not teach to make-up practice."<br/>"That's the only way Pop ever taught me. Besides,  your style's different than mine, right? You can't expect to do something  like that right away, right?" He blinked, hoping Shampoo would take the  hint.<br/>Shampoo narrowed her eyes. "No matter. If  Ranma do, then Shampoo learn too!"<br/>Ranma frowned. Shampoo obviously _hadn't_  taken the hint. "Wait a minute here! You don't have any idea what you're  talkin' about! I've been practising since I was just a little kid!"<br/>"Shampoo train since too-too little! Ranma  think he too good for Shampoo?"<br/>"N-no, you've got it all wrong..."<br/>"Then what Ranma mean!"<br/>"Well, it's just that... well..."<br/>Shampoo stood to her full height. "Ranma think  Shampoo WEAK?"<br/>"That's not what I meant!" Ranma retorted,  standing up himself.<br/>"Then tell Shampoo what mean!"<br/>Ranma met her glare. "I just mean that I'm  better than you, okay?"<br/>"Ranma better than all fighter! If Shampoo  so weak, then why Ranma so scared of her when in China?"<br/>"Cause you were tryin' to kill me!"<br/>"People still try kill Ranma now and he not  scared of them! Why he not want to fight Shampoo then?"<br/>"Cause I don't hit girls! Geez, I thought  you knew that by now!"<br/>"Shampoo think Ranma stupid! He try to hit  Great-grandmother lots!"<br/>"She's different! She's a wrinkled old mummy!  She's strong enough to take it!"<br/>"And you say Shampoo not strong? You hit  Mousse!"<br/>"Well..."<br/>"Shampoo much-much stronger than Mousse! If  not, she be wife to him already! Shampoo say that if Ranma hit Mousse,  he hit Shampoo too!"<br/>"I ain't doin' it! I don't hit girls!"<br/>"Then you insult Shampoo!<br/>"I ain't insulting ya!"<br/>"If Ranma not fight with Shampoo, then he  say she weak! He insult Shampoo very much!"<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Hey Pop?"<br/>Genma eyed his son, noting a slightly distracted  tone. "Yes?"<br/>"How come it ain't right to hit girls?"<br/>The older opened his eyes. "Of course! I should  have realized it myself, son! The reason that Akane keeps beating you is  because you're afraid to go all-out against her!"<br/>"Well, actually-"<br/>"It's my own fault, really. I should have  seen it from the start. Time for another lesson from your father, Ranma!"<br/>Ranma's expression was a mixture of disgust  and weariness. "Oh?"<br/>"Yes! I've always taught you the importance  of not hitting women! This is because they are weaker than men! But what  I never taught you is that there _are_ exceptions! Such as your beloved  fiancee. She is strong enough that you don't have to worry about hurting  her. In such a case, you actually _insult_ her when you don't honour her  skill and strength!"<br/>Ranma looked thoughtful. "So... it's okay  to hit girls when they're martial artists too?"<br/>"Exactly, boy! You always were a quick study!"<br/>"But what if I hurt them... uh, in practice?  'Cuz I'm stronger than them?"<br/>"A true martial artist doesn't have to hurt  anyone to improve! You must set other challenges for yourself in the process!  Why, when I trained under the Master, he would make me and Tendou fight  while wearing lead weights! This kept us from injuring each other, but  still pushed us to our limits! If you limit yourself, you can still effectively  train with a weaker opponent!"<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Hey Kasumi?"<br/>"Yes Akane?"<br/>Akane was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.  "Have you seen Ranma anywhere?"<br/>"I think he's practicing at the back of the  house. He was making some straw dummies before."<br/>"Oh. Thanks."<br/>Having been given some direction, Akane immediately  set out locate Ranma. What would he want with straw dummies? She'd done  it herself on occasion, to be sure. But usually it had involved pinning  a pigtail to the back of it. And before Ranma had come, she had stuck a  fake boken to the dummy.<br/>She smiled faintly. She certainly hadn't done  any of _that_ lately! Why, Ranma had been practically perfect lately. It  really wasn't hard to understand why all the other girls were so enamoured  by him. Sure, he was a little thickheaded at times, but once you had his  attention...<br/>She could hear him working out in the backyard.  Peering around the corner, she saw him rapidly pummelling a straw dummy.  He was in his female form for some strange reason, she noted. But the straw  dummy?<br/>Akane blinked as her attention was finally  focussed upon the target. It had a crudely made wig of long hair stuck  to it, and the hair was coloured... blue?<br/>Ranma noticed her observing. "Uh, hi Akane,"  she greeted.<br/>"Hi Ranma," Akane replied, still looking curiously  at the dummy. Blue hair? "Practising?"<br/>"Uh, yeah. Practising."<br/>Was the dummy supposed to be... _Shampoo_?  Akane couldn't quite believe what she was seeing. "You're... practising  hitting... Shampoo?" she finally blurted out.<br/>Ranma gulped. "Uh... well... kinda, yeah..."<br/>Why would he do something like that? Even  Shampoo made no secret of the fact that Ranma was capable of beating her  hands down. And why would want to practice hitting _her_? Unless...<br/>An idea flashed into Akane's head, but she  kept silent about it. If she was right...<br/>"Well, don't push yourself, okay? You've been  training really hard lately." She smiled. "And you've been missing your  sleeping time in class lately too, right?"<br/>Ranma had the grace to look a little guilty,  apparently glad for the subject change. "It's just for a short time!"<br/>"Don't worry about it. You can use my notes  to study for the tests."<br/>"Uh, yeah. Thanks, 'kane."<br/>"Don't mention it. Don't be late for supper.  A martial needs food to keep training, _right_?"<br/>"R-right!" Ranma agreed nervously. Why was  she being so nice all of a sudden? Was it possible that...<br/>"Anyway, don't push yourself, okay?"<br/>"N-no! Of course not!"<br/>Ranma watched Akane leave with a perplexed  look on his face. Akane was certainly acting nice these days... was it  possible she had a nice side? Or was she on to his plan? He _was_ practising  hitting Shampoo. He hadn't lied about that. But he wasn't doing it to beat  the Amazon up. He was just trying... well, he wasn't sure what he was trying  to do, but he knew it had something do with not insulting her and the fact  that it was okay to fight female martial artists who were strong. He hoped  Shampoo appreciated this, because training with her was probably going  to slow down his own training somewhat.<br/>But the alternative was to have Shampoo mad  at him, which tended to be unhealthy and painful as a rule. And to have  her seek revenge against Akane on her own, which could be disastrous. Shampoo  obviously couldn't beat Akane in a head-on fight right now, but Ranma knew  that there were a lot of other indirect ways to seek revenge. And Amazons  considered a few of them perfectly legitimate. If he kept Shampoo busy  training with him, she would have less time to work on _other_ plans.<br/>He hoped Akane appreciated this.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Akane flopped back on her bed with a dreamy  smile. It was incredible! She never would have believed it if she hadn't  seen it with her own eyes. But she had. Ranma was practising fighting Shampoo!  As a girl. And there was only one possible explanation for _that_.<br/>He planned on fighting seriously her sometime  soon. And the only conceivable reason for such a fight would be on account  of Ranma's failure to fulfill the engagement to Shampoo. And the only reason  for him to fulfill his engagement to Shampoo...<br/>would be because he planned on marrying someone else. And as for that  _someone else_...<br/>Akane's smile grew even bigger. Dare she even  hope so? Was he really taking such a liking to her? She really _had_ tried  to be nicer to him. She hadn't mentioned his losing to her for over a day  now. She'd refrained from berating him about his poor class participation.  She was even getting Kasumi to help her with meals so that they tasted  better.<br/>Perhaps Ranma _had_ noticed all this. And  perhaps he planned on meeting her halfway after all. He _did_ have a few  things to clear up, of course. Like Shampoo. And hadn't she just seen him  preparing for that?<br/>Well, never let it be said that she was ungrateful.  She wouldn't stop him from training. She would keep being nice to him.  And eventually, perhaps even get up the nerve to go out on a date. She  might have to do the asking, since Ranma seemed rather hesitant about doing  anything up front. But surely he would jump in once she asked. She would  wait a few more days to make sure.<br/>Yes, life was good. Very good.<p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;">end part 3</p>
