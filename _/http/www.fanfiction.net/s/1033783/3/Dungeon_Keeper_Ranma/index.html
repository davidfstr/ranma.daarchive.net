</div>-<br/>Dungeon Keeper Ranma  Chapter 03: Cleansweep (Edited)<br/>By A-kun  -<p>Ranma had been practicing using a magical sense that he'd   developed. It was similar to how he felt an opponent's ki, only he   could distinctly tell the two types of energy apart. Ki was usually   sensed in the manor of a flame, with it's heat and light evident, while   his magical sense was more of a radar.<br/>With his warlocks now teaching him spells, albeit slowly at   Lundar's request, Ranma's skill at manipulating the Dungeon Hearts was   increasing daily. Similarly, all of Ranma's minions were increasing in   skill as well, now that Ranma was teaching them the basics of martial   arts. Furthermore, Ranma was fairly certain he'd gained the skill to   create as many types of rooms as would be required to continue his   campaign to get all of the Portal Gems.<br/>A week later, as twelve female dark elves and four trolls hired   into his forces, he struck again.<p>Lord Avaricious never knew what hit him. Avaricious was now   acutely aware of how big of a screw up he was as he lay dying on the   floor, several Dark Elven crossbow bolts in his chest, his right hand   seared off by the magical discharge of a sentry cannon, and uncounted   puncture marks in his once proud armor.<br/>He'd frittered away the gold the king had given him to build his   fort. Avaricious had had an inkling that his habit of gambling would   lead to his demise, but he thought that it was going to be as   punishment for not finishing even a third of his fort. It had   defenses, but it was mostly below ground. One could call his fort   "Avaricious' Basement" and one would have a fairly good idea as how far   along his fort had been.<br/>Ranma didn't even believe it was worth holding. But it would be   a waste of all of the hard work his new trolls had done to simply   abandon the cavern. After all, the sentry cannons and the wooden doors   couldn't be moved to a new location. So, the martial artist turned   conquerer had the trolls build a secret door that would prevent anyone   from discovering their tunnels while Horny retrieved the Portal Gem.<p>He'd been wrestling with it for a while, close to two weeks now,   and despite the unusually calm acceptance he felt from his heart, he   couldn't bring himself to accept his mantra anymore. It was time to   talk to Lundar about alternatives to simply killing all of his foes.   He knew the Lords were likely unwilling to cough up the Portal Gems   without dying, but that didn't mean their warriors had to follow them   into the afterlife.<br/>"Lundar, can I talk to you about something?" Ranma inquired.<br/>"What is it, keeper?" Lundar asked.<br/>"I've been doing my level best to get used to this sort of   'obstacles are for killing' sort of mentality we've got going on.   Isn't there some other way we can... I don't know... not kill them, but   not let them rot in a prison?" Ranma requested of his advisor.<br/>"Well, it would require you to be on hand to make sure they   didn't die in the process, but a torture chamber could allow us to   convert most of them to our side. After all, not all of these warriors   are paid or treated as well as they should be and as the saying goes,   'An ally is better than a corpse'." Lundar commented.<br/>Ranma winced inwardly. The idea of a torture chamber brought up   memories of Kodachi. He figured she, of anyone he knew, would have   one. But, as Lundar's saying had pointed out, it was certainly better   to make an ally than more dead bodies.<br/>"It would certainly be better." Ranma answered.<br/>"Then I'll show you how to create a torture chamber tomorrow,   keeper." Lundar replied.<br/>"Thanks." Ranma responded, feeling as thought a weight, one he   never knew had been there, was lifted from his mind.<p>The torture room was actually a lot more... normal looking than   what Ranma expected. From what he'd heard of the European medieval   torture chambers, the stuff in his torture room was almost tame. There   were two means of restraint. There was the chair and then the wheel-<br/>shaped racks.<br/>The chair had two tesla coils extending from the top of the   chair, where, as Lundar explained, electricity would flow into the   strapped in victim for brief seconds. Lundar had to reassure Ranma   that it wasn't lethal, but the reassurance wasn't too convincing.<br/>The wheel racks worked on disorientation with hot coals   underneath. By comparison, the electric chairs sounded almost   compassionate. Along the nearest wall, there were plenty of whips,   spikes and many other nasty and strange torture devices Ranma couldn't   identify.<br/>"Are you sure no one's died from this stuff?" Ranma asked.<br/>Lundar considered that, "Well, unless they're very old, very   young, or you leave them to die, no one has ever died in a torture   room"<br/>Ranma stared at Lundar, who simply shrugged and replied, "You   wanted an honest answer"<br/>"So, how would we go about torturing people?" Ranma asked.<br/>"I haven't a clue. That sort of thing is usually best left to a   Mistress." Lundar responded.<br/>"But how can I have a mistress if I'm not even married?" Ranma   inquired.<br/>"You misunderstand, keeper. I was referring to a professional   torturer. They're usually women and they're referred to as Mistresses   in polite company." Lundar answered.<br/>"OOOOoooh, gotcha." Ranma nodded in understanding, before asking,   "How do we get one"<br/>"We can send an imp to one of the nearby towns with an   advertisement, like we did to recruit the warlocks." Lundar responded.<br/>Ranma took out a piece of paper and began writing the ad, using   one of the reinforced stone walls as a writing surface. He paused as   he neared the completion of the ad, "What's fair pay for this kind of   work"<br/>"I'd say 100 gold a month with free food and lodging." Lundar   answered.<br/>"So, a little more gold than a beginner warlock's salary." Ranma   commented as he finished the ad.<br/>"Yes, but it will be worth it to ease your mind, keeper." Lundar   told him.<br/>Ranma agreed that it would be.<p>The ad hadn't been in the town for more than three hours before   Ranma sensed someone entering his fort through one of his portals.   Minutes later, Ranma turned from watching the daily training exercises   to see an imp escorting a young woman wearing a cloak over to him.<br/>Ranma almost stared. The woman had slightly shorter hair that   was deep red instead of brown, but otherwise Ranma would swear that the   woman before him was a more mature Ukyou Kuonji.<br/>"You're the man asking for a Mistress?" the woman inquired with   sweet and sultry voice that, when coupled with the faint scent of   cinnamon perfume that Ranma could smell from her, made his pants feel   exceedingly tight.<br/>"Yeah, that's me. I have to warn you that we'll probably have a   lot of work for you and any others that sign on." Ranma answered,   struggling to keep his voice from cracking and maintain an aura of   confidence. Lundar had warned him that if he showed any sign of a weak   will before they were hired on, they would probably take every   oppurtunity that they could to walk all over him.<br/>"That's all right. I'm used to HARD labor." the woman teased,   obviously noting Ranma's erection. She giggled briefly as Ranma   blushed. She extended a hand out from underneath her cloak, "I'm   Maidel. I look forward to working with you"<br/>"Ranma Saotome." Ranma answered, shaking her hand in response.   He felt her aura briefly, as Lundar had showed him when he started   hiring goblins and warlocks, making sure that she would be loyal to him   once she was hired. It'd taken some practice at first, but Ranma could   now tell sincerity with a single hand shake. It was one of the few   things Ranma hoped he could keep when he returned home.<br/>As a storm cloud above crackled and boomed to get his attention,   Ranma decided to just come out and tell Maidel about his curse, "I   should probably warn you right now that I've got a rather unusual spell   on me right now. I change into a girl whenever I get splashed with   cold water"<br/>Ranma-chan felt she'd timed that well enough as a sudden downpour   began just as she finished that sentence.<br/>Maidel blinked. If she hadn't seen it, she probably would have   asked if Ranma was joking. As it was, she and Ranma-chan hurried into   the fort for shelter. That course of action was quicky copied by   Ranma's forces.<br/>Ranma-chan did her level best to wring out her favorite shirt   without taking it off, incidentally missing the look Maidel favored her   with. Had she seen it, she probably would have complained about having   another girl chasing after her.<p>The next two lords fell just as swiftly and brutally as   Avaricious. Lord Ludwig and Lord Constantine had both had much more   time to prepare, but they were caught flatfooted as Ranma's forces   attacked suddenly and viciously, tearing down the defenses laid out   before them.<br/>Ranma was very pleased to see the death tolls come down from   'everything that moved' to 'the lords and their most loyal warriors'.   Sure, Maidel and the other three Mistresses he'd hired (Lotus, Mina and   Nausica) were a bit overworked, but he paid and fed them well as their   hard work proved very fruitful.<br/>Apparently, both lords had been in such a panic to build   fortifications after hearing of their fellow lords falling that they'd   severely cut the pay of their own men. The fact that Ranma was yet to   cut a salary was so enticing that nearly every single warrior hauled   back to the torture rooms hired on with Ranma.<br/>Ranma kept silent about the fact that he could sense gold and gem   veins whenever his minions were near said sources of money.<br/>Ranma and Lundar were examining what a loyal firefly had observed   in it's travels through Lord Ironhelm's passageways. Said firefly had   nearly died in the effort, but a quick recovery and healing spell had   kept it from departing to the land of the dead.<br/>The last thing Ranma wanted was for a creature loyal to him die   on a mission, even if it had been a volunteer mission. And   furthermore, Ranma's magical map had recorded everything the firefly   had seen, making it a successful mission.<br/>Lundar motioned to some of the sentry cannons lining a few of   Ironhelm's underground passageways, "Lord Ironhelm's defenses are much   more secure. And unlike Constantine or Ludwig, he has prepared for   this eventuality. We'll have to be more cautious in getting rid of   him"<br/>Ranma agreed. With his newest spell, a poorly named "Sight of   Evil" (the warlocks explained that spying on one's enemy was considered   evil when the spell was named), he'd gathered more information about   Ironhelm's patrols inside his fortress. Ironhelm's defenses were much   more elaborate and would take a lot more time to break down.<br/>Even with his forces now including such odorous yet powerful   creatures as Bile Demons (he had been understanding and whole-heartedly   agreed when his other minions requested that the bile demons have a   separate set of lairs), Salamanders, and Skeletons, Ranma knew better   than to believe that numbers alone could handle anything.<br/>"We'll wait until we've got our forces better trained. I still   want to get a firm grasp on the powers and natural abilities of our new   Salamanders, and we still need to create more efficient team tactics."   Ranma answered.<br/>"I agree, keeper, but we'd best not spend too much time. The   more time we spend gathering our strength is more time the enemy has to   gather their own." Lundar agreed.<br/>"Then we'll strike in three days. That should give us enough   time to find a good angle for attack and allow us time to train."   Ranma declared, before he yawned loudly, "Well, I better hit the sack.   We got a lot of work to do tomorrow to set up the next temp Dungeon   Heart and get some amenities set up"<br/>"Good night, keeper. Pleasant dreams." Lundar told Ranma.<br/>Ranma almost replied in kind before remembering that neither   Lundar nor Horny really required sleep unless they had been using a lot   of magical energy. Still, it didn't feel right to just leave, so Ranma   improvised, "Don't overwork yourself, Lundar. Hate to see you get   sick"<br/>Lundar chuckled, "If that were at all possible, keeper, it would   be an impressive virus indeed"<br/>Ranma smiled and headed back to his new room. His new room used   to be Darius' room, but Ranma had commandeered it for two reasons.   One, it kept his minions from arguing over who was worthy of it, and   two, it made his feel more earthly. In his Keeper-made room, he felt   like he was a god or a fantastically wealthy man. Which he was, but he   didn't feel like he was.<br/>And even Ranma Saotome knew that a swelled head usually coincided   with a painful lesson.<p>SCENE DELETED FOR THE POLICE  Quick Info: Maidel &amp; Ranma boink.<p>Ranma was impressed with their progress. With his minions well   trained, well paid, fed, organized and highly motivated, he'd crushed   Lord Ironhelm and Lord Sigmund both in three days and was beginning his   advance once again. His forces had grown in the last few raids and he   now had close to a hundred and twenty well trained minions ready for   battle.<br/>His relationship with Maidel had cooled a bit, but they both knew   it was because he was busy. But Ranma couldn't help but feel he was   pushing her away because of the feelings of betrayl and regret that he   had that he'd had sex with someone who wasn't a fiancee.<br/>Hell, all he really knew about her was that she'd gone into her   profession out of disgust of what would have been her future husband   had she stayed with her family at the farm she'd grown up on. And that   her favorite color was actually blue, she liked men and women equally   well and she admitted to having a fondess for violin music.<br/>Okay, he knew a bit more about her than he did about most of his   fiancees. But their relationship was currently sex-based only. He   admitted that they had little time for an actual date or anything   romantic.<br/>In truth, it was mostly the little fantasies he'd picked up about   how a relationship was supposed to go that were causing him unease.   And most of those were influenced by either his moronic father, his   over-zealous mother or his oft screwed up attempts at dating one of his   fiancees.<br/>When he'd realized that, he'd chided himself. His relationship   with Maidel was going perfectly fine, present situation considered.   And besides, he thought to himself, it was nice to be thought of as a   participant in the relationship, rather than a prize or a possession.<br/>"Keeper, I'm impressed with your progress." Lundar spoke up   abruptly, snapping Ranma out of his mental wanderings, "But as the   saying goes, 'never eat something bigger than your own head"<br/>"Uh, right. ... what does that mean?" Ranma inquired.<br/>"That you need to slow down. Otherwise you'll overwork all your   creatures." Lundar explained.<br/>Ranma thought about that. He DID need to slow down. He'd just   claimed a third of the continent in roughly a month and a half.   Besides that, he needed to do something other than rigorous training to   get his mind off Maidel.<br/>Then, he realized there were towns above ground. Perhaps he   should see about improving the towns.<p>Ranma was almost aghast. Having traveled through the more remote   parts of China and Japan, he'd seen some cases of bad roads, run down   housing and poor hygiene, but most of the towns in his area of control   were like all of the worst examples combined.<br/>He needed to do something to help those poor people. And he knew   just the way to do it.<p>Next time, Ranma finds that another Keeper is after the portal   gems. Not only that, but has to fight the forces of the lord still   holding the portal gem! It's a three-way royal rumble of battalion   proportions!<p>Easy Cheat: Get access to every spell by pressing CTRL+ALT+C at   the same time, then type in "ispace barbelievespace baritsspace   barmagic".
