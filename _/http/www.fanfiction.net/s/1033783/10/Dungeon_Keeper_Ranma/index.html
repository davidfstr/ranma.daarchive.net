</div>-<br/>Dungeon Keeper Ranma  Chapter 10: Homecoming  By A-kun  -<p>The Gate Gem was an awesomely powerful artifact. It had moved   the lost continent of Atlantis to another dimension and was moving the   now-renamed continent of Harmonia back to Earth. The Gate Gem,   however, modified the tectonic plates so that there would be no   earthquakes or volcanoes erupting along or in the Pacific Rim for eight   hundred years.<br/>The Atlantians who'd created it had wanted to make sure they   weren't on or around a fault line, after all. Because that was one of   the key reasons they'd left.<br/>The continent appeared halfway between Hawaii and Japan. Yet,   despite this, the entire world took no notice, as Ranma had cast a   barrier against detection. The only people who might see the continent  had to view it with their own eyes.<br/>Ranma had advised doing that as he knew the media and governments  of his world would otherwise storm the island. They had to prepare for  the homecoming before they 'appeared' to the world.<br/>To be honest, Ranma wanted to take care of things back in Nerima   first. The last thing he wanted to do was wait around for   applications for diplomatic status to come via Japanese Post, then   having to deal with all of the other nuances of being a diplomat while   trying to see his friends and family in Nerima. He was certain that he  should go alone, though.<br/>However, his ability to teleport refused to get him past the   beaches of Harmonia.<br/>Ranma slapped his forehead as he realized that he hadn't mastered  the actual teleport spell, but rather the ability that his imps had. That  meant he had to create a Dungeon Heart in Japan, which wouldn't be that big  of a problem.<p>"Ah, good ole' Nerima..." Ranma sighed.<br/>He walked around, wondering how long it'd been since he was last   in Nerima. It seemed like a lifetime ago. He noticed he was near the   Ucchan. He wondered if it was still open. He hadn't been in Nerima   for an entire year, so it wasn't too unlikely that some of his fiancees   had moved away.<br/>Circling the corner, he saw it just as it had been when he'd   left. He entered.<br/>Ukyou looked pretty much like she had a year ago. She turned to   see who it was and caught her greeting before she could speak it,   "Ranchan! You're back"<br/>"Ucchan!" Ranma replied as Ukyou leapt towards him and hugged   him. A quick glance told him that she'd just opened.<br/>"How did you get back? Happousai said he'd banished you, but   Cologne was uncertain about what he had done. Apparently, the old man   boofed it pretty bad. Cologne thought that it might have thrown you   into a far country or even out into space!" Ukyou declared,   gesticulating wildly. (No, not MASTURBATING wildly, you perverts)<br/>"Actually, space and country aren't that far away from what   really happened. Sorry that I've been gone a whole year..." Ranma   started.<br/>"A year? What are you talking about? It's only been two   weeks." Ukyou responded.<br/>"Two... weeks?" Ranma asked.<br/>Ukyou nodded and pointed to the calendar. A red circle   surrounded the fifth with the words "Happousai plan". Roughly two   weeks had been marked off.<br/>"I guess time moves differently." Ranma commented.<br/>"So, where did you go?" Ukyou inquired.<br/>"It's a place called 'Harmonia', but it's actually Atlantis.   They took off for another dimension a really long time ago. It took me an  entire year to get back, because I had to con-" Ranma paused   slightly. He wasn't sure if he should tell anyone he went about   conquering entire nations, "-llecting these things called portal gems"<br/>"Conllecting? That's not a word, sugar." Ukyou told him.<br/>"Sorry, I got confused for a second." Ranma apologized.<br/>"You're a terrible liar, hon." Ukyou informed him.<br/>"Well, I'd rather not say what I had to do to get them or else   you'll think badly of me." Ranma told her.<br/>"I don't think I'd ever think too badly of you, sugar." Ukyou   answered.<br/>"Anyway, I met a lot of nice people," Ranma started, trying to   evade the fact that he met them after he'd conquered a land, "had some   fights," brutally murdered a few keepers, lords and their loyal guards   and banished numerous keepers, "and made some money while I was at it"<br/>"Really? How much?" Ukyou asked.<br/>"Well, this isn't a scratch." Ranma said, producing a bag of   golden coins and dropping it on the table. Ukyou looked at the coins,   which would have been easily worth between nine hundred thousand to two  million in yen.<br/>"You made more than this?" Ukyou asked, trying to pick her   metaphysical jaw off the ground.<br/>Ranma nodded.<br/>"How in the world..." Ukyou began, picking up a coin with a dragon  emblem.<br/>"It was after the fights." Ranma white-lied. It was the truth for  the most part, the coins actually were from the fortresses that he'd  conquered. His own gold had his mark on it, which was why he didn't bring  that along, "I also became close to the king and his children"<br/>"That's so amazing..." Ukyou said.<br/>Ranma was ready for more praise. He liked it from everyone, but   especially those who knew him before he'd become a keeper. It startled him  when she began crying.<br/>"Ucchan? What's wrong?" Ranma asked.<br/>"I... I don't deserve you..." Ukyou whimpered.<br/>"Huh? Where the heck did this come from?" Ranma inquired.<br/>"You've come back so handsome, strong, confident... and now   you're rich. I... I..." Ukyou tried to explain.<br/>Ranma realized what it was. He had feared, when everyone saw his   new powers, that he would be seen as some sort of god. His men had   grown to have the same mind set. Ranma didn't like being seen as some   sort of diety. He was still Ranma Saotome. He was just a lot more   now.<br/>For Ukyou, though, it was the wealth. If she continued to pursue   Ranma, she was inwardly doubting if it was truly him or his money. To   prevent herself from being too tempted, she was willing to break up   with him.<br/>Ranma hugged Ukyou, letting her sob against his chest.   "Ukyou, listen. You aren't shallow for desiring the money that I   have. In fact, that you were willing to give up on me because you   feared all that I had makes you a much better person." Ranma told her,   "Don't doubt that"<br/>She looked up into his eyes and was about to protest, but he   silenced her with a kiss. She melted into it. She didn't even notice   or care that two tiny green men appeared near her door, took down the   store curtain and locked the door, before heading into the kitchen to   clean up and reinforce the walls as Ranma carried her upstairs.<p>Two hours later, Ranma found himself standing at the front of the  Tendo Dojo. He'd washed up pretty thoroughly and he was sure that if he  smelled like anything, it would be brimstone (he'd stopped to visit a  dungeon near lava to pick up some more coins.<br/>He exhaled, then focused, before opening the gates. He walked to  the front door, and for the first time in a very very long time,   knocked on the door frame, before opening the door and called out,   "'scuse me"<br/>In the living room, the entire Tendo family and the two remaining  members of the Saotome family heard the call. Everyone's eyes snapped  wide open as they tried to figure out who's voice it was and their eyes  widened further as they realized who said voice belonged to.<br/>"It couldn't be..." Soun began.<br/>"It is! Ranma!" Kasumi declared, standing up just as Ranma   entered their view.<br/>Then, just as the two families were about to do a combined group   hug, the moment was spoiled by a bandaged old pervert splashing Ranma   with cold water.<br/>"RANMA! I MISSED YOU!" Happousai cried, lunging for the new   bosom.<br/>And he quite probably would have made it, had Ranma not sensed   his presense, used his ki to evaporate the water, then punted Happousai  for a two city field goal.<br/>"The ONE THING I did NOT miss." Ranma commented, before turning   back to the surprised two families.<br/>"Ranma... you didn't-" Genma began.<br/>"Huh? Oh, yeah. Neat trick I learned in Harmonia. You wouldn't  believe how many times something'll splash you there." Ranma responded,<br/>waving the question aside.<br/>"Harmonia?" Nabiki asked.<br/>"It's a loooong story and I've been on my feet for a while."   Ranma replied, as he motioned everyone back to the table, "For one   thing, I've been gone a lot longer than you all think"<br/>Happousai, meanwhile, was not happy. That miserable ungrateful   little punk hadn't even let the aged master touch what was properly his  until he released Ranma from his school.<br/>Yes, Ranma was going to pay dearly. As soon as Happousai   recovered and managed to get to Nerima district, Ranma was going to   pay. Happousai looked at his landing spot and with some quick   calculations, added in the fact that he'd have to dig himself free   first. Four, maybe five days, tops.<p>Lundar was enjoying a good book. It had been quite a while since  he'd been able to sit down and simply enjoy such trivial desires. Yes,<br/>indeed. After almost a year of campaigning against King Reginald and  the other keepers, Lundar was finally getting back to his second love:<br/>Reading.<br/>The thing that he'd liked most was that he was finally getting   new books. Before Ranma had come, Lundar only had the same five   hundred thousand or so books and read most of them four or fives times.<br/>Lundar's eyes widened as he felt something. No, LOTS of   somethings. He'd become tuned with the Primary Dungeon Heart that   Ranma used, so much so that he could feel when other Dungeon Hearts   moved.<br/>But Ranma hadn't known about Keepers or Dungeon Hearts, so how-   Lundar's mental question came to a screeching halt as he recalled what   he'd told Ranma when they'd started out:<br/>"But you are not of this world. I can sense that. Someone has   banished you here." Lundar murmurred.<br/>"...On top of that, Keeper, if this Dungeon Heart is destroyed,   you shall be banished from this land into one at random"<br/>All the enemy keepers had somehow been banished back to Ranma's  world! Even if it was against Ranma's prior wishes, Lundar had to alert  him of the threat plaguing his land. But, Ranma had warned that his  world had unusual dangers that Lundar and such would not be ready for.<br/>"Horny! We must go to Ranma immediately!" Lundar called,   entering the Reaper's personal room.<br/>"I did not hear him call. And believe me, I would know." Horny   responded, before sipping on a fruity drink with one of those little  umbrellas in it.<br/>"Yes, but all the keepers we'd slain were banished HERE!" Lundar   explained, bearing witness to the infinitely rare scene of Horny doing   a spittake.<br/>"WHAT?" Horny asked, looking over at Lundar, before relaxing.<br/>"And Ranma didn't bring any protection!" Lundar continued, still   panicked.<br/>"You're right, he might knock up some of the female keepers.   Lundar, have you forgotten? Keepers do not exist on this world, thus,   even if they managed to build a dungeon, there is no way they could   have very much in the way of creatures because there are no portals."   Horny responded.<br/>Lundar stared Horny square in the eye, "You know nothing of   Portals, do you? Unless an active portal gem is in the area to prevent  it, a keeper can MAKE his own portals and without the limitations of  fifteen creatures at a time! Not to mention, all the portal gems were  fused into the Gate Gem, which, while it does retain that power, is  still at the same scale! He could block the ones in his city, but that's  it"<br/>"But what about money? How would they pay their creatures?"   Horny asked.<br/>"I've done some research on that too, but I learned about it a   bit too late for it be anything of trivia until now. When a Dungeon   Heart transports itself or creates a faxsimile, it changes less   valuable minerals, plants and most insects into gold or gemstone and   gathers them into a tight spot, which we know as gold or gem veins.   And even if there aren't enough of such things, they can still use the  Create Gold spell." Lundar explained.<br/>"SHIT!" Horny cried as he realized Lundar was right.<br/>With that, the two teleported away.<p>There were many people in Nerima that had not missed Ranma   Saotome's presense. This group of people was almost entirely made up   of Ranma's rivals, but also included those who simply thought he was   the source of the problems that made Nerima noisy (i.e. the citizens of  Nerima). Most of them, however, simply figured Ranma had gone on a   training trip, and thus would be back.<br/>Ranma's primary rivals in particular were very happy. They were   all very delusional, so they believed that Ranma had fled from them,   knowing their eventual victory was at hand. All of them had ignored   the fact that they'd aided Ranma in getting back at Happousai (someone   they all considered worse than Ranma) and the fact that Cologne   reminded them constantly (with the aid of daily beatings) that Ranma   had not fled, but rather had been sent to a random location.<br/>Tatewaki Kuno was especially glad to see that the foul sorcerer   known as Ranma was gone. It meant that the pigtailed girl and Akane   Tendo were now his by default. It was a bit disconcerting that he had   not seen the pigtailed girl in some time, but she often vanished for   weeks at a time, no doubt to compose herself so that she would be able   to confess her feelings.<br/>Then, Tatewaki saw her: The pigtailed girl.<br/>Yes, there she was, dashing past him with a sack on her back, a   pickaxe in hand, dancing and hopping on the ground. She seemed a bit   shorter than before, but her features were unmistakable.<br/>"AH, PIGTAILED GIRL! COME, LEAP INTO MY ARMS!" Tatewaki cried,   leaping at her.<br/>She didn't react like he thought she would. Before he was even   halfway to her, she did a backflip and vanished in a burst of green   sparkles. Tatewaki blinked, then slammed facefirst into the asphault.<br/>It did not take Tatewaki Kuno long to go through an insanely long  list of incorrect answers (the pigtailed girl loved him, the pigtailed  girl was under the enslavement of that foul sorcerer Ranma Saotome, the  pigtailed girl did not have the chance to confess her love to him) to  come to a surprisingly correct conclusion: Ranma Saotome was back.<p>Mousse was glad that his first and foremost rival for Shampoo was  at last punished for his inherently evil nature. Surely, without   Saotome around, Shampoo would confess her feelings for him.<br/>"SHAMPOO! THE FATHER OF YOUR CHILDREN IS HERE!" Mousse cried,   jumping towards Shampoo. He had his glasses on, because he'd spent   four weeks recovering from hugging and kissing Cologne the last time   he'd tried this without his glasses. (One week to recover physically   and four to recover mentally)<br/>He predictably ran facefirst into a serving plate. Shampoo   snorted, "Ranma is back"<br/>"No, but I am!" Mousse responded, recovering from the injury.<br/>"Then father of Shampoo's children not here." Shampoo responded,   smashing Mousse out of the open door with a well-placed spinning knee   to Mousse's face, with a grace found only from having done it over   three thousand times before.<br/>Mousse groaned as he opened his eyes. It seemed that he'd been   hit rather hard this last time. He was seeing miniature Saotomes.<br/>Mousse shook his head, but the delusional Ranmas didn't vanish.   They instead continued dancing in front of Mousse for about two   minutes, then vanished in a flash of green energy.<br/>Mousse went through an short list of incorrect answers (Shampoo   loved him, Shampoo was under the influence of Ranma's evil   machinations, weird-looking Ranmas were dancing, weird-looking Ranmas   vanished in a style reminiscent of Star Trek) and came to an   unsurprisingly wrong conclusion, "AAAAAAH! ALIENS THAT LOOK LIKE   RANMA ARE INVADING NERIMA! AAAAAAAAAH-URKLE"<br/>Cologne sighed. Apparently, not having Ranma to blame his   problems on was driving Mousse insane.<p>Ryoga was a mixture of exceptionally happy and a bit frustrated.   On the one hand, Akane was now free and once he worked up the courage   to face her (and found her house), he'd win her heart for sure.<br/>On the other hand, Ranma was an okay guy sometimes and was one of  the few people Ryoga knew enough about to talk with casually. Ranma  kept his skills sharp and gave him the determination to continue   training.<br/>Ryoga was finding himself missing his oft-time friend/rival.   Ranma could infuriate him, but he was also one of the few people who   would actually help him find his way, rather than just point in the   wrong direction (in Ryoga's mind, it didn't matter if it was the right   direction or not if he didn't get there) and probably laugh at him   behind his back.<br/>Ryoga was lost in an alleyway behind Doctor Tofu's clinic when he  spotted something small and green. It had bulged eyes, looked vaguely  humanoid and had something long in it's hand. It turned to him, then  started giggling.<br/>Ryoga did the sensible thing.<br/>Ran off screaming.<br/>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ANAL PROBING ALIENS"<br/>He only stopped when he was sure that there were no more aliens   around. He'd heard all about aliens and their tendency to do anal   probing on people (even if he didn't know what it was, it didn't sound   like it was likely very comfortable.<br/>He looked around for the alien or anything similar. He sighed in  relief. No anal probing aliens in the vacant lot, just Ranma.<br/>Ranma?<br/>"Saotome! How dare you trick us like that! We thought you were   thrown across time and space and here you've just been in this vacant   lot!" Ryoga growled, kicking Ranma in the head.<br/>Ranma yelped and turned around.<br/>Then Ryoga noticed Ranma was short and green.<br/>He ran off screaming again.<br/>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! ANAL PROBING ALIENS HAVE CLONED   RANMA SAOTOME! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Ryoga shrieked.<p>Nabiki had heard some tall stories before, but the slapdash story  Ranma had half-lied through was pushing it, even for Nabiki's limit, "Oh,<br/>come off it, Saotome, there's no way you could have gone to another  dimension"<br/>Horny and Lundar appeared, "Keeper! We have grave news"<br/>"A MONSTER!" Soun yelped at the sight of Horny, before   whimpering, "Don't eat my little girls"<br/>"I don't eat humans." Horny explained, mentally adding,   "anymore.<br/>Ranma sighed and slapped his forehead, "Great timing there,   Lundar. And didn't I tell you to stay back in Harmonia"<br/>"Yes, but as I said, we have grave news! Your rival keepers have   found their way here, they can create gold, and they can construct   their own portals!" Lundar explained, giving Ranma the cliff notes on   the situation.<br/>"Ah, man! Just my luck! Guess we'll have to hunt them all   down." Ranma sighed, hopping to his feet.<br/>"Wait, keeper? Rivals? Hunt down? Ranma, what have you been   up to?" Akane angrily demanded, using her usual formula (everything   was Ranma's fault) to get an impossibly correct answer (for Akane  Tendo): Ranma was hiding something.<br/>"Look, I ain't got time for this. Let's just say that if I don't  hunt down these guys, it's likely things ain't gonna be too peaceful  anywhere." Ranma responded, preparing to teleport away with Lundar and  Horny, creating a teleportation circle.<br/>Ranma was as surprised as everyone else when Nodoka surged   forward and grabbed Ranma's arm just as the teleportation spell   activated, halfstepping into the teleportation circle as she did. She   had been meaning to add some words to the action, but something   happened that cut her off.<br/>"No, wait, IT'S DANGE-" Lundar began.<br/>Back at the Tendo Dojo, everyone stared at the spot where Ranma,   Nodoka, Lundar and Horny had been.<br/>"Um, it looked like something bad just happened." Nabiki noted,   looking at the burn mark on the ground, where Nodoka had been.<br/>"NODOKA!" Genma yelled.<p>There's a little known fact about teleportation spells. For the   most part, teleportation spells are simply supposed to move Object A or   Person A to Location B.<br/>Personal teleportation spells worked very cleanly, transporting   the person and every non-living thing they were carrying or holding to   the desire location.<br/>Teleportation circles are another story. They operated by taking  everything within the circle to the desire location. It could be very  messy should someone halfstep into the circle just as it   activated, which was why everyone in Harmonia knew not to interupt   teleportation circles.<br/>Nodoka Saotome was not from Harmonia, however, thus she didn't   know about that particular rule. The half of her that was not in   the circle had been disintegrated.<br/>Nodoka had some things going for her, despite this major blunder.<br/>The person she was holding onto was Ranma Saotome, the person who  happened to be casting the spell. Ranma Saotome was connected to the  most powerful Dungeon Heart in existence and had been teleporting to said  Dungeon Heart.<br/>A little known fact about the Dungeon Heart was that it could be   used to revive, restore and regenerate fallen creatures who were allied to  it's Keeper. Nodoka was VERY loyal to her son, thus the Dungeon Heart  accepted her as it would one of Ranma's minions.<br/>Since Ranma had teleported so that he would appear over his   Dungeon Heart, the effect was just as instantaneous as Nodoka's loss of  half of her body.<br/>However, due to the fact that the tremendous shock alone of both   processes (losing half of one's body and then regenerating it in the   span of three seconds) could have lead to Nodoka's demise, the Dungeon   Heart had to do a more complete regeneration in order to make certain   that Nodoka didn't die from the restoration.<br/>Nodoka Saotome blinked and looked down at herself as she and   Ranma appeared over his Primary Dungeon Heart. Ranma, Lundar and Horny   had been expecting to see half of a middle-age woman, but instead saw a   full TEENAGE woman.<br/>"M-m-m-m-MOM?" Ranma blurted out, shocked at the sight of an   eighteen year old woman who looked like sort of like his mother, but   more like a slightly older sister to his female form.<br/>"Wh-wh-what just happened?" the renewed Nodoka asked.<br/>"Ordinarily, you would've been cut in half, but it would seem   that luck was on your side. Ranma's Dungeon Heart restored you to   life, but it would seem that it went further..." Lundar commented.<br/>"Further?" Nodoka inquired of the mentor, still very shaken by   the experience. She'd FELT half of her body disappear and then regrow,   then it had tingled all over.<br/>"Having half of your body destroyed and then regenerated so   quickly would have killed just about anyone over twenty, so the Dungeon   Heart continued the regeneration until you were young enough to   withstand the shock." Lundar responded.<br/>"But, it's never done anything like that before!" Ranma   protested.<br/>"Hmmm, it may have responded to your desire to keep your mother   alive. In any case, Keeper, she's had her youth restored. She's no   older than eighteen." Lundar answered, before adding in, "And half-<br/>naked, I might add"<br/>Ranma quickly summoned a robe and wrapped it around his mother.   The last thing he wanted to do was ogle his own mother, even if she was   young enough to be his sister.<br/>"Ranma, I think I'm going to have a nice lay down." Nodoka   announced, before fainting dead away.<br/>Ranma caught her before she could touch the floor. He turned to   Horny, "Take her to the Keeper bedroom. She needs to sleep"<br/>Horny nodded numbly, still shocked himself that the Dungeon Heart  could restore someone so fast, let alone give them their youth back.<br/>"This is turning out to be a rather big headache. We should   probably contact Reginald. We'll need to keep the world away from   these incidents for a while." Ranma commented.<br/>Lundar nodded in agreement.<p>Keeper Morgana was infuriated. Not only had this evil gnome-imp-<br/>thing come bursting into HER Dungeon, but he'd fondled every female in  her Dungeon. And the flurry of spells she and her Mistresses were  tossing at him, which should have been attracted to him in the first  place, were missing!<br/>"Heya, sweet cheeks!" Happousai said cheerfully, as he glomped   Morgana's ass again.<br/>"DIE YOU DEMON!" Morgana roared.<p>Explanations<p>Q. Why do that to Nodoka?<br/>A. I've always felt that what Genma did to Nodoka (leaving her   all alone at home for ten years) was something that needed to be   corrected. Thus, I restored her to her youth! Let's see if Genma can   convince her to remain married to him when she's full of teenage   hormones once again!<p>Q. What's up with the 'alien Ranmas?<br/>A. The imps Ranma creates fresh still resemble normal Imps, but a  lot of his older imps have already begun (or finished) transforming   into miniature versions of Ranma (about half his height). The last   thing to change is their skin tone, so some of them are still green-<br/>skinned. The ones that are confused for normal Ranmas are the ones   who've already finished their transformation.<p>Next time, on Dungeon Keeper Ranma!<br/>Keeper Morgana and her dungeon of Mistresses continue to hunt for  Happousai!<br/>Nerima is in a panic at the numerous sightings of miniature Ranma  Saotomes (and pigtailed girls), aliens, and alien Ranma Saotomes (and  pigtailed girls!<br/>Nodoka recovers from her shock!<br/>The U.N. meets King Reginald and Keeper Ranma!<br/>And the War of the Keepers begins!
