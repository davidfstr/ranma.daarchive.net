</div><p>It had taken a while, but Nodoka Saotome had regained her sense of self. She had gone a bit crazy from the increased hormones and extra energy gained from being a teenager once again, but she'd managed to balance out.</p><p>She still wouldn't remarry Genma for all the tea, rice and bread in the world, but she had balanced out.</p><p>As such, Nodoka found herself in a very unique situation, a situation that very few people ever found thsemselves in: Being able to join the very generation she'd once placed her hopes on.</p><p>Having lost nineteen years of age (though she would've claimed less), Nodoka had serious issues to consider. Now that she was young again (a few sorceresses in Ranma's staff had done a thorough examination and confirmed that the process would not undo itself), she was free to decide her own future for once.</p><p>That was part of the problem. Her prior life had been dominated by her family. During her early childhood and teen years, she'd been crushed into a role that was uncomfortable and uninviting. She'd been married off to Genma, who had been part of a family of a slightly lesser standing.</p><p>She would have rather barfed up her appendix than marry the slovenly man, but her parents had done a fairly good job of crushing Nodoka's will. Sure, she was proud of the son that Genma had given her, but as far as she was concerned, that was pretty much the only good thing that had came from the arranged marriage.</p><p>For the last fourteen years, sitting alone at home, she'd look outside at the younger girls who's wills weren't crushed and their personalities forced into specific ruts by their parents. A new age of women's liberal movement had given the latest generation more freedom than Nodoka had ever had.</p><p>There was no way in hell Nodoka was missing out on the fun this time around. Her parents had kicked the bucket and there was no way in hell either one was going to hold Nodoka Saotome back!</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Dungeon Keeper Ranma<br/>Chapter 13: Things Aren't Always As They Seem<br/>By A-kun</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;"><i>Author's note: My apologies, but this chapter will be<br/>shorter than others. So, I slapped on a bunch of replies<br/>to extend it. Enjoy! Or not! BEEEEEDAH:P</i></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It had caused a minor trance. Mostly because Ranma didn't believe who it came from.<p>"A what?" Ranma inquired.</p><p>"Slumber party!" Nodoka repeated.</p><p>"..." Ranma began, before snapping out of his minor trance again. This time, he asked a different question, "Why?"</p><p>"Ranma, you know how noble women were treated back in the feudal ages, right?" Nodoka asked.</p><p>"Yeah... they were forced into roles to get husbands and essentially bartered for a better social standing... why?" Ranma inquired. He'd never liked that part of history, but his disliking of it grew when he'd gained his curse. He hated the idea of having his freedom stepped on.</p><p>"That's how my mother and father thought. I have two brothers and I was the only daughter, so I had to put up with that stupid ideal." Nodoka explained, clenching a fist in anger, "And frankly, I missed out on a lot of things girls today take for granted. Like slumber parties, karoake bars, movies... even things as pathetic as board games were denied to me! The only times I ever got to see a movie was when it was a family movie, and the one time I ever played a board game that wasn't Shogi or Go was the time a friend and I played a rare copy of Monopoly at her house before she moved to the U.S. permanently!"</p><p>Ranma almost felt like taking a step back. His mother had a LOT of repressed rage that was coming to the forefront now that she'd been freed from the shackles of maturity.</p><p>"Well, I don't have a problem with it. If you want to, I guess I can let you use the dungeon in Nerima..." Ranma began.</p><p>"And you'll come too, right?" Nodoka inquired.</p><p>"Uhh..." Ranma began.</p><p>Nodoka splashed Ranma with a bucket of cold water, which finally explained why she'd been carrying it in the first place.</p><p>"I mean, we're almost sisters, if you go by age." Nodoka commented, smiling widely.</p><p>"..." Ranma-chan responded, "Fine, I'll come along."</p><p>"WOOOO-HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" Nodoka cried happily.</p><p>Ranma-chan heated the water still on her body and returned to being Ranma-kun, "I've still got a lot of work to do today, but I'll be back later. I promised Governor Ventura that I'd investigate Duluth more, so if you need something, just ask one of my minions, okay?"</p><p>Nodoka nodded before Ranma teleported away. Nodoka did a few cartwheels of pure joy, then pulled out a notebook, "Okay, we need ice cream, soda, a few party games, at least four normal movies and three pornos... mmmm, a good mix of magazines of the same... hmmm, actually, I better ask Ranma if they have any electric outlets down here..."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Tatewaki was confused. This was because the situation he found himself in was quite the perplexing one. Ranma Saotome had pretty much admitted to the world that he was, indeed, a sorcerer, like Tatewaki had always believed. However, Ranma was playing the part of a benevolent sorcerer, which meant either Tatewaki had been wrong about the "foul" part, or he was simply hiding it.<p>But none of that mattered at the moment.</p><p>The Prime Minister of Japan and most of the members of the Diet were visiting their humble abode and asking Tatewaki to become the official Ambassador to Harmonia, since he had frequently spoken with Ranma Saotome and thus, could make a better impression than most of the people in Japan.</p><p>Apparently, they had not heard of Tatewaki's... dislike for the younger male Saotome (Tatewaki found he could barely tolerate the elder Saotome).</p><p>The reason they were turning to the Kunou clan was a simple one. Every other member of the Kunou clan were ambassadors, save for his father (who had married into the clan), his sister and himself. In fact, Japan currently only had ten or so ambassadors that WEREN'T from the Kunou clan.</p><p>It wasn't something Kunou liked to focus on, but while the Kunou clan had a proud samurai ancestory, they only truly distinguished themselves as delegates, ambassadors and negiotiators.</p><p>Thus, why the current administration was eager to get the next available (and mostly sane) member of the Kunou family as the next ambassador to one of the most important countries in the world.</p><p>Tatewaki was loathe to meet with the male Ranma Saotome, but on the other hand, it was his patriotic duty to honor his ancestors and continue the other tradition of the household.</p><p>Ultimately, Tatewaki found he had to accept. After all, personal grudges were nothing to his family's honor.</p><p>"I accept." Tatewaki said.</p><p>"WOOHOO! BREAK OUT THE SAKE!"</p><p>"Who let him in here?" the Prime Minister inquired.</p><p>"He's the entertainer for the evening." his assistant answered.</p><p>"Make a note never to bring Mister Yotsuya ever again." the Prime Minister replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki looked over the girl. She didn't know what had been ailing her, but the blonde girl certainly hadn't been in any sort of condition to be walking by herself.<p>Luckily, there was an infirmary in the castle. Genma and Soun were the only other patients in the room, and that was because they'd been gorging themselves on the tasty foods provided by the castle's chef.</p><p>"Back again, eh, Cerl?" the priestess, Melissa, asked.</p><p>"Again?" Nabiki inquired.</p><p>"She's got a condition that she keeps ignoring until she gets like this." Melissa inquired.</p><p>"What kind of condition?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>Melissa paused, "Chronic stomach cramps. She gets them from eating certain foods, but she won't give them up."</p><p>Nabiki got the feeling that the priestess wasn't telling the truth, but decided to lay off of the subject.</p><p>"Well, I've got to be going. I hope she feels better." Nabiki replied.</p><p>As Nabiki left, Cerl opened her eyes. She waited until the Tendo girl was out of the room before whispering, "Thanks, Melissa, for not blabbing."</p><p>"It's not my place to tell your secret. I just hope you find that potion soon." Melissa answered.</p><p>"I'm close. Just a few more days at most. Then this will all go away for good." Cerl responded.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"!" he cackled evilly, "With these creatures, the world will soon be MINE! !"<p>Suddenly, an imp ran up and chittered at him.</p><p>"What do you mean 'We're under attack'? Who'd attack us?" the man inquired, turning to see a giant red demon and a cocky pigtailed martial artist standing in the doorway.</p><p>The man blinked, "Who are you?"</p><p>"I'm Dungeon Keeper Ranma, and this is Horny. And we'd like to talk to you about what happened recently." Ranma began.</p><p>"What? Someone trip over one of my imps at the junkyard?" the man asked.</p><p>"No, the entire city of Duluth was apparently incinerated." Ranma answered, frowning. He got the feeling the man was genuinely confused. And it was quite possible too.</p><p>"It was WHAT?" the man asked, a panicked look on his face, before depression set in, "Aw, man! I loved that pizzeria! Not as much as Fat Lorenzo's, but that's too much of a drive."</p><p>"Wait, if you didn't do that, then what's your scheme to rule the world?" Ranma asked, looking at all of the Sci Fi nutrient-filled tubes that filled the room.</p><p>The man recovered and grinned evilly, "I shall rule this world WITH THESE!"</p><p>The man gestured and one of the tube drained and opened, releasing a small brown furry creature, "Eevee?"</p><p>Ranma's left eye twitched. He had the feeling he now understood why Nabiki's eye twitched a lot. The man bent down and picked up the furry fox-squirrel creature, grinning widely, "That's right! I can now create Pokemon or Monster Rancher creatures! With enough practice, maybe even Digimon! Ooooh, they're so cuuuuute..."</p><p>Ranma managed to keep his composure, though he was VERY tempted to facefault. Horny wasn't sure what the tiny creatures were good for. Maybe they were delicious?</p><p>"Okay, I suppose I can let you go, but if you cause any trouble, we'll be back." Ranma declared, trying to regain face for essentially bothering an Otaku.</p><p>"Oh goodness, I'd better not SNORE." the man mocked him.(1)</p><p>Ranma and Horny glared at him.</p><p>"Sorry, couldn't resist." the man apologized meekly.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Jerry Falwell was a fat-headed moron who complained a lot. And for some unknown reason, people actually stopped to listen. However, through some divine miracle, ever since Harmonia made it's appearance, he was simply looking more and more like a giant twit that no one should listen to.<p>He had predicted that with the rise of the demons, violent crimes too would rise. He also predicted that the number of so-called unsolved murders and disappearances would sky-rocket.</p><p>He couldn't have been more wrong.</p><p>Actually SEEING demons walking around had caused a sharp decrease in murders and such. After all, seeing is believing and the thought of becoming a bile demon was not exactly something most people wanted to consider. Worse was the idea of being tortured by one, especially after the footage of one who had ambushed a convenience store robber and spent ten minutes bouncing up and down on the criminal, farting relentlessly, before the police came to take the poor crying bastard to a safe prison.</p><p>Even worse for criminals, was the fact that various creatures and warriors of Harmonia were making themselves available to police forces around the world. So, one didn't have to just worry about a police dog chasing them down, one also had to worry about a police DRAGON chasing them down.</p><p>And 99.999998 of all criminals shat their pants when they found out that bullets didn't work on dragons or Dark Angels, nor could they penetrate any part of the enchanted armor of the Knights and Dark Knights, not even the eye holes of the helmets.</p><p>"Funny, that." Ranma murmurred. He'd been worried about how enchanted armor would deal with bullets, but apparently, without significant substance or magic behind it, bullets were worthless, while crossbow bolts and arrows weren't.</p><p>His wizards had come up with the answer: an arrow or a quarrel struck the armor, and while the force from the tip was lessened, the weight and momentum of the rest of the projectile was sometimes enough to penetrate the armor's outer layer. A bullet, on the other hand, was so light, that when magic stopped the force, there was no weight or momentum to push it any further.</p><p>So, either criminals would have to start arming themselves with swords and crossbows again or else, they were shit out of luck.</p><p>With revelations of the improved law enforcement, almost no group found any significant reason to stop Harmonia from extending a helping hand.</p><p>Except for three.</p><p>The first was the Taliban, but since they were shitheads, no one would listen to them.</p><p>The second were corrupt politicians who had a lot to lose from their criminal organizations being broken up. And unfortunately for them, the weight of the glares sent their way when they protested, often let that little fact slip out into daylight.</p><p>And the final one was, surprisingly, NOT the Catholic Church (oh, they threw a large hissy-fit, but could find nothing openly wrong with the actions of any of creatures of Harmonia, and besides none of the demons or Dark Angels so much as flinched when faced with any of the holy relics of the Faith), but rather, the Christian Coalition.</p><p>Yes, the same "geniuses" who though Wisdom Tree were Gods of Gaming, who thought Pokemon were demon spawn (which was laughable, because they were now products of specialized magical breeding and not demonic in the least), and who threw a huge hissy fit when Dungeons and Dragons got a crappy Saturday morning cartoon.</p><p>Of course, the Coalition tripped on it's own feet and managed to choke itself half to death when various open-minded Christians all abandoned the Coalition, leaving it as flaccid in political power as it was in mental power.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma-chan found herself at the slumber party with mixed emotions. She was glad to get away from the nearly relentless requests, insults, suggestions, threats and every other kind of correspondence that she'd received since Harmonia had made it's grand entrance into the world proper.<p>Ranma-chan could probably name almost everyone in the slumber party, but she didn't want to, because she didn't want to think much.</p><p>Her mother had really gone all out. There were drinks aplenty, snacks, little steamtray entrees, a grill/bar, comics, magazines, PLENTY of beds generously donated by a number of mattress companies (who begged that Ranma not make Lairs available to anyone outside of Harmonia), televisions, DVD/CD players, PS2s, XBoxes, Gamecubes, and even a series of sixty four top quality PCs that were networked for a LAN party. Of course, with so much hitech equipment, it was unsurprising that Nodoka had opted against the board games.</p><p>Oddly enough, they'd found out that sticking the male end of a plug into a mana fountain was the same as an outlet. It also worked as a T2 line. No one was sure why, but they had all the lines smoothed over so that no one could accidentally knocked the plugs out.</p><p>The party was reaching it's full swing when Ranma-chan had entered. Nodoka was flitting energetically from one side of the room to the other. It almost looked like Ranma-chan was watching the Flash on crack.</p><p>"HEADSHOT!" came the digitized voice from the LAN party, followed by Kasumi yelling, "WOOHOO!"</p><p>Shampoo was dancing with a group of Dark Elves, who apparently had the same tribal dances as the Jokuketsuzoku, to a Fleetwood Mac album (which, thanks to the Dungeon Heart, they could understand perfectly); Ukyou had opted to man the bar and was serving up a multitude of foods that she didn't normally make at her resturaunt, aided by a female rogue named Konatsu; Princess Mina and Maidel were playing co-op Mario Kart: Double Dash! on one of the Gamecubes; Princess Honey was having a blast playing Halo; while Princess Relena and a few elves were fascinated by .Hack/Infection.</p><p>Ranma-chan sat down on a lone mattress and sighed with relief. With everyone preoccupied, she might be able to get some re-</p><p>"PILLOW FIGHT!"</p><p>WHAPTHUMP</p><p>Ranma-chan glared at Nabiki, grabbed a free pillow and retaliated.</p><p>And Ranma-chan found that the party was actually a lot of fun after that, even if everyone wound up hot, sweaty and in their underwear.</p><p>At least, until Nodoka whipped out the porno videos.</p><p>The images of Martian Sexxessor Nadesico, The Screwers (a Slayers parody), and La Blue Genesis Evangelion would be burned into Ranma-chan's brain for a month.(2)</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>And somewhere, Akane shuddered at the thought of hot, sweaty flesh and decided that next time, she wouldn't ask the chef for freshly made brats.<p>Then a demon spawn leapt out of nowhere and tried to eat the brat straight of Akane's mouth, making it look like she was french-kissing it.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>(1) - Borrowed line from the infamous Mojo Jojo of the Powerpuff Girls when similarly threatened.<br/>(2) - If you're wondering, no, they don't exist. However, I'm HIGHLY surprised that no lemon authors have tried to make stories with these names!<p>Next time, I'll hopefully move away from things that might piss off various religious readers! And make the chapter a decent size!</p><p>I also altered it so that people don't have to trudge through those boring Q &amp; A things to read the FUNNY omake.</p><p>Chapter 14: Kunous and Keepers<br/>Tatewaki meets Ranma...AGAIN!<br/>A feud between unlikely Keepers!<br/>Genma's Operation True Romance 2!<br/>Happosai...DEAD?<br/>And Ryouga's Fearless Return!</p><p>Mister Yotsuya is courtesy of Maison Ikkoku.</p><p>Most people who've read the entire manga collection or watched the entire anime thinks they know each character.</p><p>Tatewaki and Kodachi Kunou are both fairly intelligent.</p><p>Some people might answer with a laugh and say, "Yeah RIGHT!"</p><p>But think about this: Tatewaki knows Japanese (an already difficult language to master for anyone not born with their speech patterns), Ancient Japanese, English, Classical English (which, anyone who's gotten a migraine reading The Bard will understand IS a separate language) and French (if you include the dubbed version of the anime).</p><p>Anyone who knows that many languages, even if not entirely fluent in them, is generally pretty smart. And Kodachi probably is about as good. Kodachi is also good at science.</p><p>Now, that brings up the question, "If he's smart, why can't he figure out the Ranma-male and Ranma-female are the same person? And that neither Ranma-female nor Akane want his affections?"</p><p>That starts to hit a pretty critical point. He might be a Genius.</p><p>That's right, Tatewaki and Kodachi Kunou might be Geniuses.</p><p>Why do I say this?</p><p>Because one of the traits of genius is having a large amount of intelligence in a specified field, but little (if any) COMMON SENSE.</p><p>And Common Sense would point Tatewaki to the correct answers to the questions regarding Ranma and Akane.</p><p>In this regard, Nodoka, Kasumi, and various other cast members of the Ranma 1/2 universe may also be geniuses. (Ranma definitely is. No common sense whatsoever in that boy.)</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;">Omake Feature:<br/><i>People You Would Never Want To Get A Dungeon Heart</i><br/>Or<br/>A Dungeon Heart Is Forever (AT LEAST UNTIL YOU KILL THEM!)</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Naga was sent flying, as usual, by Lina's "energetic" reply to a band of bandits trying to ambush them. Of course, the bandits had been IN FRONT of Lina and Naga had been BEHIND Lina, so Naga was beginning to think that Lina wasn't exactly telling her the truth about it being "just a lack of focus".<p>As she smashed through a surprisingly thin rock face, she landed in the middle of three roofless archways over a strange beating thingy. Naga brushed off the rock as both an elderly man and a large red horned demon entered the room.</p><p>"Oh, come ON! This has got to be the most ridiculous Omake yet!" Horny complained.</p><p>"YOU DARE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE GREAT NAGA THE WHITE SERPENT? YOU SHALL KNEEL BEFORE ME, PITIFUL DEMON! OOOOOHHH-" Naga began.</p><p>Then Lina smacked Naga over the head with a slipper, distracting Naga from her trademark laugh.</p><p>Then, she turned the author, who was masturbating furiously at the thought of all the Naga-imps, and cast a Dragon Slave.</p><p>BOOM</p><p>The End</p><p>A-kun: pouting HEY! I wasn't masturbating FURIOUSLY!</p><p>Naga the White Serpent - Slayers</p><p><i>Pros:</i> Lina could get all the money she ever wanted; Mini-Naga imps would be both kawaii and sexy; life of luxury would be easily attainable.</p><p><i>Cons:</i> Mini-Naga imps would amplify THE LAUGH.</p><p><i>Final Decision:</i> BAD IDEA (unless you're completely deaf.)</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Got something to add to this feature?
