</div><p>Nathaniel was livid. Not only had Ranma just informed them of why they were now stuck in jars where their dungeon hearts once were, but a group of jack-off vampire-wannabes suddenly started attacking a number of his favorite towns and places.</p><p>Though Nathaniel was loathe to get involve in combat that might ruin that reputation of his recent creations, anything that fucked with his favorites was going to die.</p><p>Again.<hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Dungeon Keeper Ranma</p><p>Chapter 17: Keeper vs. Keeper</p><p>By A-kun<hr noshade="" size="1"/></p><p>/ indicated telepathy.<hr noshade="" size="1"/></p><p>Bridget LOVED being a vampire. She'd wanted to be one ever since she was thirteen and got a bad case of zits. Once the so-called 'cool kids' teased her about being a 'pizza face', she'd been forced to re-evaluate just what was important. When a few goth girls took her into their circle, she was thankful and eagerly joined them.</p><p>She never looked back.</p><p>But there were levels to the goth culture and she soon found a different circle of friends, the Vampyres.(1)</p><p>Once again, she never looked back.</p><p>As far as she was concerned, wearing all black, sucking blood, living at night, and not having to live by society's restraints.</p><p>So, when the opportunity to become a real vampire came about, she took it and never looked back.</p><p>Bridget and several of her recently-turned friends were currently storming through their high school, killing whoever they wanted, and laughing as people fled screaming before them.</p><p>As fun as it was, it didn't take long before people chose to stand up to them. Without the sight of dead bodies behind them and no sight of guns or knives, some of the football players felt they were good enough to take on the vampires.</p><p>That was a big mistake, as all they managed to do was humiliate themselves as the vampires toyed with them, slapping them or kicking them back the way they'd come. Once the jocks were frightened off, five more people decided to stand up to them.</p><p>Four were the goth girls Bridget had once hung out with, Katherine, Carol, Sheena, and Gretchen. The last was a tan overweight boy named Aaron with a black buzz cut who was a 'martial artist'. Even though he was laughed at and picked on, Aaron had never lost any fight started with him, so he might actually be something of a threat.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>"Why, Bridget? Why the death and misery?" Katherine, the leader, inquired.</p><p>"Because it's fun!" Bridget sneered, "You should've taken it to the next step... you don't know what you're missing out on..."</p><p>"You're right, she's missing out being a complete tool." Aaron spoke up, "So far, you've shown you have the maturity of a two year old."</p><p>One of Bridget's companions, Fix, snarled and darted forward. He was so fast, Bridget could see Katherine's eyes widen and struggle to follow the pale vampire boy's movements. A second later, Fix was in front of Aaron, motionless. Bridget snorted derisively and waited for Aaron to flinch.</p><p>Instead, Fix fell back, clutching his throat with both hands, his esophagus now the shape of a 'U' instead of an 'O'.</p><p>Aaron snorted back at Bridget, "You all thought fatboy couldn't move, didn't you? You stupidly assumed that because I'm overweight, I can't be as quick as you."</p><p>Aaron was in front of Bridget faster than Bridget could blink, and was now crushing Fix's throat more completely in his left hand, as his eyes locked hers in place, "Guess what? Fatboy was also the name of a bomb. And explosions are mighty fast."</p><p>Bridget remembered was turning and running the instant Aaron's thumb snapped Fix's neck off as easily as flicking a booger, and her other friends lunging at Aaron.</p><p>She'd gotten to the end of the hallway when her friends started screaming.</p><p>Bridget ran and ran. She had to find somewhere far far away from her hometown and people like Aaron. She had to get free of the Keeper who'd made her into a vampire. She would find a small town far far away and do her level best never to give anyone any reason to do what Aaron had just done to Fix.</p><p>And once more, Bridget never looked back.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Just like Bridget, other vampires were finding nasty surprises. Some of those surprises were people who'd studied a wide enough vampire mythos to know how to ward off the vampire attacks. Others were fortunate enough to have connections to Nathaniel, so when the vampires burst into a resturaunt or a hospital or even a few nudey bars, they were greeted swiftly and brutally by large flame-breathing Charizards, equally massive plasma-breathing Dragonites, and even diminutive water-spitting tortoises who ducked to let the strange fox-squirrels who had yellow fur spit lightning at the now wet and highly conductive vampires.</p><p>Others were quickly shot down and then finished off by followers of Xanus, the Keeper who'd effectively disarmed all of the super powers of the world. Though both keepers were loathe to admit it, they had a mutual enemy in the jerk who'd just sent an assload of vampires to attack cities across the United States.</p><p>So, it wasn't long before Xanus found himself face to face with a brown-furred fox-squirrel who was in the arms of a anthropromorphic fox woman with yellow and white fur. The fox-squirrel gave Xanus the once over as well. Xanus was only five foot six, but he had nice brown ahir and deep blue eyes, and he was at least bigger than the fox creature.</p><p>"Greetings, Keeper Xanus. I am Keeper Natheniel... or rather, I'm an Eevee who is currently possessed by Keeper Nathaniel. In any case..." the fox-squirrel looked up to the fox woman, "Can you hold me higher? I'm hurting my neck here?"</p><p>The fox woman obeyed and the Nathaniel-possessed Eevee gained a rather perverted grin as she raised him so he was pressed against her chest, "As I was saying, it would seem we are in dire straits. I've just heard from Keeper Ranma that some serious shit is going on and he's a bit preoccupied, so we're going to have to hunt down this jack-off Keeper by ourselves for the time being."</p><p>"He's the one who destroyed Duluth, isn't he?" Xanus inquired.</p><p>The Eevee hummed thoughfully, "If you aren't the one, then chances are high that one of the last two are. Ranma's kept me somewhat informed of the situation around the world and from what I can tell, only a keeper or a mage can do that, but magic's been kinda dead for a long time prior to the Hearts... in any case, there are only about five or six keepers left on this world, including you, me and Ranma, so the one who destroyed Duluth must be among us. And since I've been busy playing God, you've been busy playing Hero, Ranma's been busy playing Ambassador; that leaves the last few as suspects."</p><p>Xanus nodded.</p><p>"By the way, how did you make thirty-five million converts?" Nathaniel inquired.</p><p>"I only made ten million converts." Xanus replied, frowning deeply.</p><p>The two keepers looked at each other for a few seconds.</p><p>"OH FU-"</p><p>No sooner had the vampires begun to route than twenty million skeletons started running down roads in various crowded cities and towns, shrieking and howling while slashing at people with swords was enough to throw any city into a panic, even when the number in each city was individually small. Even just a thousand for various small towns and ten thousand for the major cities was enough to cause wide-spread terror.</p><p>Xanus had to admit that even though it was assbackwards from proper strategy, it was fucking brilliant for the mystery keeper to send a diversion to aid in recovering his best forces.</p><p>Most people wouldn't think skeletons were too scary on their own, but skeletons had no blood to bleed or organs to stab or shoot, the weapons that can actually handle even a single magically-created skeleton is rather small.</p><p>A skeleton didn't care if it's ribs got damaged. It didn't care if an arm was broken.</p><p>A skeleton didn't need skin to feel, blood to move, a heart to beat, a mind to think.</p><p>A skeleton didn't need a skull to see, hear, smell or taste. It could sense targets even minus a head of any sort.</p><p>A skeleton didn't have fear.</p><p>Worse, a skeleton was actually a very small target. One had to be able to hit a fly with a bullet in order to shoot a skeleton's bones, and buckshot only had a marginally bigger chance of hitting.</p><p>To say local police were overwhelmed was to put it mildly. Most police officers hadn't had the chance to take a course on handling undead because most police academies didn't offer such classes, and when each one had the arm strength of a professional baseball player but didn't get tired, their attacks were quite dangerous.</p><p>The only things the police had going for them was the fact that there were keepers on their side and that monsters loaned to them by Dungeon Keeper Ranma were able to take some of the load. Things started to change for the better when the police switched from using guns to using their vehicles and nightsticks, but it didn't improve that much, as a number were intact enough for their mysterious keeper to heal them.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma had issues of his own to deal with. All at once, over four hundred thousand enemies had shown up on Harmonia's shores. Worse, his Dungeon Heart wasn't able to identify their species.<p>From what Keeper Nanami had just told him, her island was under a similar attack and his Sight of Evil confirmed that the same creatures were crawling all over the shores of her Harmonia.</p><p>The first thing to do was to get a first line of defense established. Ranma was actually grateful he'd gotten so many opportunities to prepare against sudden invasions during his march across Harmonia, but he'd never had to establish a line of defense against such a large force nor had he needed to protect such a large section of land against invasion.</p><p>The first order of business was attended to by dropping some knights, goblins, dwarves and rogues a mile inland from most of the areas he detected intruders. He scattered various mistresses, elves, wizards, fairies and monks behind them. He left the Dark Angels and Royal Guards to defend the villages, in case any of the enemy were able to sneak past the first lines of defense.</p><p>Once the frontline was made, Ranma decided to take a better look at the enemy attacking Harmonia. He possessed an imp and activated the Umisenken before sneaking to locate the nearest group.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Kasumi had to admit that things had to be desperate for assistance if Ranma had picked her and Ukyou to back up Bagor, Michael and several other goblins and knights. Sure, Cerl, Lotus and Zenobia were there too, but that didn't really change the fact that he'd included her in the battleplans.<p>Though, as she started seeing the loping enemy forms, she began to seriously worry about WHY Ranma needed her.</p><p>Perhaps the most identifiable figure was an eight foot tall gorilla-esque creature with a bat-like face.(2)</p><p>Intermixed with the bat-gorrila creatures were beasts that were larger in size than the first, but had what looked like a cheezy green bodysuit, akin to what characters from super-hero movies wore to make their physique look more impressive than it was. The only truly unusual thing was that the creature's neck was incredibly thick and leaned forward, no doubt to reinforce itself when it used the horn that forward straight forward from it's forehead.(3)</p><p>Next were the unusual creatures which looked like crabs or lobsters whose bodies looked to be resculpted to resembled a basic human form.(4)</p><p>Behind them were brown-skinned creatures with what looked like a duffel bag on each shoulder. They looked a bit like the first bat-gorrilas, but their heads were slouched forward like the horn-headed beasts.(5)</p><p>In very small numbers intermixed with the the duffel-creatures were blue-skinned creatures which resembled the green-skinned horn creatures, but had shell-like armor that was overlapping, akin to cross between an armadillo's shell and medieval armor, and long claws instead of fingers.(6)</p><p>The sheer number of enemies when compared to the number of Harmona's forces, which numbered only around sixty-five hundred active members, was disconcerting to say the least.(7)</p><p>It was only the fact that Ranma had lost very few living minions during his campaign that had Kasumi steadying a bit. She and Ukyou knew a few attack spells, but they hadn't really practiced the bigger spells in large quantities.</p><p>Ranma's telepathic message reached Kasumi and from the look on everyone else's faces, he was likely contacting everyone at once/I've got good news and bad news. The good news is that the enemy is setting up to stagger itself into waves, and what is currently on the island is about it for their forces. Bad news is each of you is going to need to take down at least sixty or more of these things. From what I can tell, they're not magical, so we've at least got that advantage firmly on our side. I've prepared some reinforcements, but they'll be in the areas that need them most./</p><p>Kasumi took several deep breaths, steeled herself and started chanting her firebomb spell. It might or might not do much, but she wasn't going to let everyone down now that she had a way of helping out.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Xanus had to admit that he felt bad that he and his followers had been forced to break into over a thousand hardware stores, since his original goal was simply preventing any nation from pulling an Judgement Day scenario, but their collection of weaponry had been focused more around knives and guns, neither of which were all that useful against skeletons.<p>Perhaps the most interesting turning point in the desperate struggle were the arrival of a mixed bag of martial artists and the Bruce Lee movie fanatics. Even if the majority weren't all that good, extra hands had been quite useful in turning the tide on the skeleton army.</p><p>Once the tide of bone was finally stopped, though, many of the surviving vampires returned, this time with an even larger army. The new one made up of lesser creatures, but the billion rats or so that swarmed into each major city were certainly numerous enough to cause the weary defenders of the cities to gulp, groan and whimper in dread.</p><p>"This is pointless, Xanus! It's the keeper whose causing this ruckus that we have to stop." Nathaniel growled, though his frustration only served to make his temporary Eevee body look more adorable.</p><p>"And just how do you propose we stop him or her? We don't even know where they are!" Xanus demanded hotly.</p><p>"When the vampires started running the first time, I sent one of my canine creations off to track it on the back of an avian creation." Nathaniel smiled, before frowning, "I know where he or she is, I just don't have the manpower to launch an assault on an unknown factor."</p><p>"Did I just hear that you men know where the enemy responsible for these terrorist attacks is?" came the gravelly voice of a man with a five o'clock shade inquired.</p><p>"Uh... yes?" Nathaniel answered.</p><p>"If you're willing to wait an hour, I can get a infiltration team together." the man explained.</p><p>"Just who are you?" Xanus inquired.</p><p>"Name's Fisher. Sam Fisher." the man replied.</p><p>For some reason, Xanus and Nathaniel both developed a twitch in their left eyes.(8)</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Keeper Ranma wasn't sure what or who had made these creatures, but they were certainly resilient. Even he and Horny smashing their ways through a literal sea of the mutant creatures, and they'd been pounding for over an hour to a far smaller effect than they had through Reginald's army, and that was saying a lot. Even his modified imps weren't doing all that well, and they'd handled a number of his most obnoxious foes on their lonesome.<p>The last time Ranma could recall such a long and brutal fight had been the battle between him, Titus and Dante.</p><p>Horny swung his scythe, bisecting six more of the mutants before it became lodged in the hard shell of one of the crab-like creatures. Horny spat flames, but save for gaining the Reaper some needed room, it didn't cause much of an effect.</p><p>Ranma couldn't count the number of times he'd used Welcome Gate Iron Fingers or the Dance of the Mad Gods. When the imp he'd been possessing had died, he'd possessed another and leapt into the fray again, thankful that imps didn't feel much in the way of exhuastion.</p><p>Ranma didn't dare try using any of his combat spells, since he needed the full stream for healing and maintaining Horny's power. Even so, he would have KILLED to be able use some of his more recently learned and admittedly nastier spells.</p><p>But given their opponents, he wasn't sure they'd do much.</p><p>Ranma felt a signal come from an imp.</p><p>"HORNY, DOWN!"</p><p>Ranma and Horny hit the dirt as a barrage of magical cannon fire and electrical discharges struck the monsters, slaying a few and dealing moderate damage to a fair number more.</p><p>Ranma and Horny leapt their feet and raced over the hill where the magical cannons and lightning generators were, quickly pursued by mutants, who didn't realize anything was wrong with that concept until the lead mutant, one of the bat-gorrillas noticed Ranma and Horny standing at the foot of the hill on the other side, grinning widely. He screeched to a halt, slowing down the ones behind him enough for the trap to spring.</p><p>The hill beneath the feet of the mutants vanished, and the mutants dropped out of sight.</p><p>"Heh. I wish we could have used that one on Nemesis." Ranma commented as he gazed down the massive hole to see the last of the mutants vanish into the molten hot lava below.</p><p>"Somehow, I don't think this would work too well underground." Horny commented.</p><p>"Nonsense. We'd just have to switch the hollowed out hill and the iron doors for a stone bridge." Ranma answered.</p><p>"Isn't it a bit early for us to be celebrating, Master?" Horny inquired.</p><p>"Oh, right. Let's hope the others fall for this sort of trick." Ranma noted, as he and Horny teleported away.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The assembled forces that Sam Fisher had managed to pull together was from a wide assortment of agencies, and a few went solely by their code names, like Master Chief, Solid Snake and Raiden.<p>Nathaniel and Xanus both twitched at meeting the power-suited man, the grizzled dark-haired veteran and the blonde pretty boy ninja, but managed to keep things moving. Xanus himself had managed to pull together three of his most loyal, while Nathaniel had provided rides in the form of massive fire-breathing Charizards, a pair of massive birds that Nathaniel called 'Fearows', and brought along three anthropromorphic females from various series, including the foxgirl he'd brought to the negotiations.</p><p>Xanus was vaguely disturbed by Nathaniel's furry fetish, but it was just as well since Nathaniel was put off by Xanus' strong anti-nuclear opinions.</p><p>"Listen up, Solid Snake and Sam Fisher can ride on the Fearow, to provide you two an opportunity at stealth, though it might not mean much if our enemy is as good at detecting stuff as we are. The rest of us will attack via the Charizards to catch his attention." Nathaniel explained.</p><p>They separated and hopped onto their respective rides.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Dart never thought he'd be fighting back to back with a Dark Angel, but while both he and Zachiriach were impressive fighters, many of the strange creatures were persistent and surprisingly resilient. The bat-headed gorillas were easy to kill, but the rest had some form of regeneration, making them irritating to finish off, even if they were easy enough to injure.<p>Dart leapt into the air and began to charge his magic for his Phoenix Drive technique. He hated to leave Zachariach by his lonesome, but the Dark Angel seemed to know what Dart had in mind as he raised three skeletons and leapt into the air, out of Dart's path as the Fire Dragoon's technique reached it's critical point.</p><p>"PHOENIX DRIVE!" Dart roared, shooting into the sky, then swooping down and carving a swath through the enemy lines.</p><p>Zachariach growled in frustration as he gazed down at the enemy. Though a good eighty or so had died in that single strike, the rest didn't seem fazed by the sudden drop in allies.</p><p>[What manner of creatures are these that they'd ignore the loss of so many allies? Zachariach wondered, gazing down at the creatures. Few creatures, even amongst the Dark Gods minions could so blaisely ignore the kind of damage that Dart had just dished out.</p><p>"Looks like you boys could use some help." the raven-haired Black Dragoon, Rose, spoke up as she arrived at the scene.</p><p>"These creatures are infuriatingly difficult to finish off." Dart growled as he reascended to speak with Zachariach and Rose.</p><p>"That's because most of them are mindless." Rose responded.</p><p>"Golems? Zombies?" Zachariach inquired.</p><p>Rose shrugged, "They might as well be."</p><p>"Do you think we could get them with your Rashomon Gate?" Dart inquired.</p><p>"Yes, but I might get the villagers too if I tried to get all of them." Rose answered, "But I can probably nab a majority on the north side."</p><p>"Then do it. We'll finish the rest." Zachariach ordered, firing off three acid blasts at two of the strange brown ones with the duffel bag-esque pods on their shoulders. The strange pods could fire out strange beams that burned like the most searing fire magic and Zachariach did NOT want to feel said attacks again.</p><p>The two creatures howled as their faces began to melt. A howl echoed through the village as Prince Daniel and collection of knights charged in from the south, pincering the southern group.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>It wasn't long before the flight of Charizards sighted the target, a citadel floating over the middle Atlantic ocean.<p>Xanus was surprised that their enemy even had any minions left to fire the massive ballista bolts that were now flying at them. But it didn't take a genius to figure out from the reused buildings that their enemy was indeed the one responsible for the destruction of Duluth Minnesota.</p><p>The "Welcome To Duluth" sign on the side of the citadel was another big clue.</p><p>The Charizards did well to avoid the ballista bolts and slammed heavily into the ramparts, allowing their passengers to leap off before beginning to rampage, destroying the defenses.</p><p>Nathaniel grinned as he zipped past the skeletons, below their notice because of his current form's diminuitive size. The guards were certainly fools, since he had amped up this particular body far beyond the normal limits of the creatures seen in the game.</p><p>Despite his early glee at being ignored, Nathaniel found the citadel to be somewhat mazelike, and had to backtrack several times before he found a crowd of vampires between him and what was likely the heavy steel door to their enemy.</p><p>Nathaniel opened his mouth as he ran towards them.</p><p>The vampires screamed as the tiny fox-squirrel spat a ray of pure plasma boiling their bodies away and punching a large hole in the door. Nathaniel spat another polt to destroy the door so that his allies could follow him.</p><p>As Nathaniel entered, he leapt, narrowly avoiding the pit trap that would have skewered his tiny body like a shishkabob. He had to teleport back out of the room to avoid the flurry of spells that would have vaporized him by the mystery keeper, who looked like a human figure made entirely out of light.</p><p>As the mystery keeper started to walk into his view through the hole in the steel door, Nathaniel spat a freezing beam, encasing the keeper in three feet of ice. Nathaniel scurried back into the room to destroy the Dungeon Heart, but the mystery keeper appeared in front of him, slamming a spear into the ground in front of Nathaniel.</p><p>Nathaniel spat flames, but the creature swung his arms, the flames spilling around him like smoke. Nathaniel growled as he unleashed a telekinetic blast, but the creature ignored it entirely.</p><p>"Creatures like you disgust me." the creature snarled.</p><p>"Pompous assholes like you disgust me, so we're even." Nathaniel replied.</p><p>"JUDGEMENT!" the creature roared.</p><p>Nathaniel screamed as he flew backwards and slammed heavily against the far wall, every bone in his temporary body shattered. He pumped healing energy into it, but it would take a while before it could move again.</p><p>"What the hell do you think you're doing? Saving people from themselves?" Nathaniel taunted.</p><p>"Why would I waste my time? Humanity's time is at its end. We've been needing a good cleansing for a while now, but the weapons that would do so were always in the hands of the weak and small-minded." the creature answered.</p><p>"So you want purification?" Nathaniel asked, incredulous, before snarling "Well, too fucking bad! GO PURIFY YOURSELF, DICKWEED!"</p><p>Nathaniel roared, his body flaring with anger as he began to summon all of the elemental power that he'd put into the Eevee's tiny body.</p><p>Nathaniel shot forward and was on the other side of the room before the creature could react. It barely had time to leap in front of its dungeon heart before Nathaniel unleashed the most powerful multi-elemental attack that he could muster.</p><p>Fourteen different elements slammed into the creature, sending it flying across the room as Nathaniel shot forward, ready to destroy the Dungeon Heart, but the creature appeared in front of him again, "JUDGEMENT!"</p><p>It was only quick thinking that allowed Nathaniel to dodge the attack as he teleported across the room[SHIT! This could go on forever!</p><p>A pair of missiles from the ceiling revealed that Solid Snake and Sam Fisher had both managed to infiltrate the room from the ceiling, but a wave of the creature's hand sliced the two projectiles in half, causing their premature detonation.</p><p>Xanus and the rest of the allies burst into the room, weapons drawn and rushed the creature. The mysterious keeper slipped between each strike, flicking each attacker away with surprising force.</p><p>"THAT'S ENOUGH!" the creature snarled as Sam and Solid Snake began to throw grenades at the Dungeon Heart, "ALL OF YOU, BURN!"</p><p>The next thing Nathaniel saw, the room was on fire, and everyone was struggling to return to their feet.</p><p>"COOL OFF!" Nathaniel answered, "HYDRO PUMP!"</p><p>Water exploded through the walls and flowed into the room, stopping all of the fires.</p><p>As the water receded, a familiar figure stepped through one of the holes. Ranma grinned, "KNOCK KNOCK!"</p><p>The creature wasted no time snapped a hand towards him, "JUDGEMENT!"</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Oooh, cliffhanger.<p>My apologies on this being late. My pre-reader has been so goll-durn tied up that I'd decided, for better or worse, to finish the series without him, when out of the blue, he sends me a harried comment: "It sounds a lot like a 'Rocks fall, everybody dies' sort of ending."</p><p>As for why it took so long for me to post it even after he told me that: Because the battle with the last "bad" keeper felt too short (as in Horny comes in and he dies), for better or worse, I'm changing it.</p><p>Hopefully DK Ranma 18, both the finale AND the conclusion of this series, won't take so damn long to finish. Oh, and yes, I'll be providing a webpage with the images for the various Guyver-based monsters for those too lazy to look them up on Google around the same time I post Chapter 18</p><p>(1) - A Vampyre is essentially a 'living vampire'. They're people who got into the habit of drinking blood to be as much like vampires as possible. They're listed in the Ravenloft monster manuals.<br/>(2) - From Bio-Booster Armor Guyver: Ramotith. Featured in the original anime and the manga. Ramotiths are the base-level Zoanoid of the Chronos Corporation and the most easily produced. Seen in Book 1, Chapter 3.<br/>(3) - From Bio-Booster Armor Guyver: Gregole. Featured in the original anime and manga. Not quite as easily produced as Ramotiths, Gregoles are far stronger and have padded armored skin which makes them far more bulletproof than most other Zoanoids. Seen in Book 1, Chapter 1.<br/>(4) - From Bio-Booster Armor Guyver: Granza. Not featured in either the original anime or manga, but found in the artbooks. Assumed to be an aquatic-based unit, their deployment could be intended for both land (as heavy armor) and deep ocean.<br/>(5) - From Bio-Booster Armor Guyver: Vamore. Featured in the original anime and manga. Not particularly strong. Vamores have a large bio-laser mounted on each shoulder, which can open and fire a short powerful beam. Unfortunately, the fuel for the bio-laser is toxic to the Zoaform, limiting how often it can fire, since it has to dispose of the used toxins before it can fire again. Seen in Book 1, Chapter 2.<br/>(6) - From Bio-Booster Armor Guyver: Delcasse. Not featured in the original anime or manga. The Delcasse has bio-lasers in their forearms, the emitters being where their palms would be. Their ruged armor shell is impenetrable to standard projectile weapons. The color of the Delcasse was indetermineable from the images I saw, so I picked a color at random.<br/>(7) - To give you an idea of how badly the active Harmonia forces are outnumbered, for every one person on Harmonia's side, there over sixty people for the enemy.<br/>(8) - That accursed twitch is back. BTW, for those who haven't played it, Sam Fisher is from Splinter Cell. Of course, considering the wide-spread publicity Splinter Cell has gotten, your T.V. channels must be poor, religious or non-American/non-French to not have this commercial. Seriously, it's akin to not knowing who Mario or Mickey Mouse are.</p><p>Chapter 18: Don't Fear The Reaper (Fear Its Keeper)</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Omake Feature:<br/><i>People You Would Never Want To Get A Dungeon Heart</i><br/>or<br/><i>Dattebayo Dungeon Keeper?</i><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Horniculus was massaging his temples. If he hadn't already found out that aspirin was worthless for demons, he would have tried another bottle.</p><p>Another random Dungeon Keeper. Horny didn't understand who the hyper-active blonde ninja wearing an eye-gougingly bad outfit was, but he didn't like having to be the brat's enforcer. Naruto Uzumaki didn't have much need for Horny, which left the demon time to drink pina coladas and reminsce about the old days, before boys containing demons were allowed to learn insanely powerful techniques.</p><p>At least the boy was enthusiastic about his new position. He'd conquered his home country and converted most of his fellow ninja, though he had 'accidentally' let quite a few die in the torture chamber.</p><p>The creepiest thing was when Naruto taught his 'Kage Bunshin' technique to his imps, which now looked like slightly shorter copies of the boy himself.</p><p>"Dattebayo!" the six or so mini-Narutos cried before each multiplied by a hundred times, scattering all over the room, before each scurried off on various tasks.</p><p>When Naruto nabbed Horny's scythe and raced out of the room, Horny cried, "Good ahead and take it! I stopped caring three Omakes ago!"</p><p>End.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Omake Feature:<br/><i>People You Would Never Want To Get A Dungeon Heart</i><br/>or<br/><i>The Grim Adventures of the Horned Reaper</i><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>"Grim, meet Horny. Horny, Grim." Mandy declared.</p><p>The Grim Reaper stared at the Horned Reaper.</p><p>"This has GOT to be the WORST joke in history of Omakes. I oughta find the blasted author-" Grim paused as he noticed what was in Horny's hand, "ooh... I like your scythe..."</p><p>"Thanks, though yours will always be a classic..." Horny answered.</p><p>"Thanks, man. Most people usually joke about the scythe, how it's passe, that it's uncool." Grim responded.</p><p>Horny shook his head, "They're just jealous. Classics like your scythe should be cherished... I remember when I had one just like it. But my keeper ran short on funds and sold it, and by the time I managed to get enough cash together to buy it back, someone else had already bought it, so I had to get this upgraded model..."</p><p>As the two chattered away about scythes and reaping techniques, Mandy gazed over at her companion, Billy, who'd already been eaten by an irate salamander for trying to mess with her eggs.</p><p>"This is dull. End it." Mandy commanded.</p><p>"You don't own me!" A-kun growled.</p><p>Mandy punched him in a very sensitive place, "END IT NOW!"</p><p>End.</p><p>But only because I wanted to...</p><p>Owie... for a little girl, she really hits hard...</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Got something to add to this feature?
