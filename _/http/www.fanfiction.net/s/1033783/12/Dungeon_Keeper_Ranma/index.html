</div><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Dungeon Keeper Ranma<br/>Chapter 12: New Stage, New Rules<br/>By A-kun</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane awoke from dreamland for the second time that day (third time if one counted waking in the morning). Her bed seemed a bit warm, but that didn't really matter. She closed her eyes and tried to turn onto her side. She couldn't.<p>For some reason, that didn't bring immediate alarm to her mind. Instead, she simply tried to turn the other way. Again, she found herself incapable of doing so. The heat on her back was growing unpleasant. She decided to turn onto her stomach.</p><p>When she couldn't do that, she finally opened her eyes. A stone ceiling. Akane contemplated why that bothered her. Then, she realized a stone ceiling meant she wasn't at home. Which could only mean she'd either been kidnapped in her sleep or... or that Harmonia thing, the arrogant bint Maidel and such HAD happened.</p><p>She took in her situation rather quickly following that revelation. She was laying spread-eagle on a thick wooden wheel that was spinning. She glanced beneath her to see a stove of hot coals sitting roughly two feet beneath her, which was why she was uncomfortably hot. She was also quite naked.</p><p>The confusing part was that she didn't seem to be tied down. She tried to pull her limbs up and found that they were held down as if they were bound by invisible rope.</p><p>Maidel looked up from an interesting book that she'd had the imps sneak from the Tendo household. It had incredibly realistic pictures of naked people having sex inbetween fascinating articles and letters from people who'd wrote in about their own sexual experiences.</p><p>Akane saw the title of the book and frowned. She'd seen Nabiki reading it avidly and when she'd asked about it, her sister had said it was a health book, but she could see quite clearly from her angle that it was NOT. (Of course, what Akane didn't know was that Nabiki had stolen it from Kasumi, who'd found it in the attic in her mother's belongings)</p><p>"Oh, you're awake again." Maidel noted idly. The articles were fairly involving, but she really had to get around to dealing with the brat. Then she'd have to swap with Nausica for the 'graphic novel' her fellow mistress had an imp swipe for her called "Revolutionary Girl Utena".</p><p>"Well, I think it's high time you started learning some manners." Maidel declared, forcing her will into the torture chamber and cooling the coals beneath Akane, who looked greatly relieved.</p><p>"HMPH! I don't need some loose tart telling me about manners!" Akane snarled.</p><p>Maidel would have gotten mad had Akane called her that when they'd first met, but Maidel was beyond that. Akane continued to struggle to get free in utter futility.</p><p>"Don't bother. The magic of this place will bind you to that wheel until certain circumstances are met." Maidel explained, "The way I see it, little girl, you have a few options in your position."</p><p>Akane continued to struggle, but paused every so often to glare daggers at Maidel, who continued her lecture as if knowing Akane would listen, even if she didn't appear to, "Option one, You could keep struggling and cussing, which would force me to turn on the coals to help you sweat out that nasty temper of yours. Option two, you could struggle and cuss worse, forcing me to move you to the electric chair. We affectionately call it Zappy the Magic Mood Changer. Option three, you could relent to being punished and released at my whim. Option four, you could be punished by another professional torturer. Option five, you beg for forgiveness."</p><p>Akane stopped struggling and considered her options. She looked rather thoughtful before she looked at Maidel with guilt and remorse in her eyes, "I'm sorry. Please forgive me."</p><p>"I put in option five to see if you were a gullible dork." Maidel announced, smiling as Akane suddenly unleashed a torrent of colorful curses.</p><p>Maidel sighed. Ranma said that he didn't want Maidel to do anything that might hurt Akane permanently. But he never said anything about anyone else... Maidel stood up and stuck her head out the door. Three of her fellow mistresses were playing sex poker, a more lewd version of strip poker where the losers bartered sexual favors after losing their clothing. Maidel decided that they would be perfect, "Violet, Sugar, Wendy, you bored?"</p><p>The three looked at her and answered in unison, "YES!"</p><p>"Got a new victim. Wanna break her in?" Maidel asked.</p><p>The trio looked at Maidel with sparkles in their eyes. Had Maidel ever seen an anime, she would recognize it as the 'Kawaii Girl Sparkle of Joy' (1).</p><p>They got their uniforms on (had to look professional, ya know), and scurried into the torture chamber, eager to return to their favorite past-time.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>"Thar she be..." Olan said with a thick salty seaman accent.(2)<p>Ranma rolled his eyes, but had to admit that it was an impressive feat of magic, "Well, I can understand why you never employed them during the war..."</p><p>On the north side of the castle, away from any possible direct attacks, were twenty large galleons.(3) They looked like any other wooden vessel that became romanticized in pirate movies, only there was one major difference: These galleons were a hovering a hundred feet above sea level.</p><p>"Do we have anyone familiar with piloting them?" Ranma asked.</p><p>Olan nodded, ditching the accent, "We've had a few wizards working with sailors. For all intensive purposes, they're more manueverable, but they still handle like ships at sea."</p><p>"Well, since they're all set, I suppose the only thing left is to supply 'em and get ready to move out. We'll probably leave as soon as Nabiki feels she and King Reginald are ready." Ranma declared.</p><p>"Hey, Ranma?" Nabiki asked as she stepped out onto the airship dock.</p><p>"Yeah?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"I'd like to talk to you about this planned meeting with the U.N." Nabiki told him.</p><p>"Okay." Ranma responded. It felt a bit strange for her to be asking him to talk rather than the other way around, but he had to admit anything she needed to talk about would definitely be of value.</p><p>"Have you contacted the governments about this meeting?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Uh, no, not really. I thought we'd fly in and present ourselves." Ranma replied.</p><p>"And risk being shot at as a possible terrorist attack? No, you need to announce this sort of thing. The U.N. might not even be in session, meaning that if you simply go to the U.N. building, you'd probably just waste a trip. We should have King Reginald do most of the speeches, too. What about disclosure?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"Huh?" Ranma inquired, blinking.</p><p>"How much are you going to tell them? They'd want to know all they can about Harmonia. You're going to be talking from a diplomatic advantage, seeing as you understand this world a lot better than most of the world will understand Harmonia. And they will definitely resent that fact." Nabiki told him.</p><p>"Well, I don't know. I was kinda figuring on breaking everything slowly." Ranma responded.</p><p>Nabiki shook her head, "Full disclosure would be best, Ranma. Maybe some alteration of minor facts that you think might make things iffy," Nabiki gave him a well-meaning look, which informed him someone had blabbed about the truth to her, "but the more honest you are at the start, the more likely they'll trust you later. And you should definitely bring a variety of creatures to show them so they know you aren't faking. The best looking and most of the well-behaved creatures. Probably a dragon or a salamander would do well."</p><p>Ranma sighed, "Yeah, I guess."</p><p>"Also, you should prepare for a diplomatic banquet, you'll probably want to prepare for the media, set up special informational amusement parks... Frankly, Ranma, this sort of thing won't be easily taken care of." Nabiki told him.</p><p>"Lemme guess, you want to sign on as Public Relations." Ranma asked, smiling.</p><p>Nabiki cricked her neck, "Actually, considering how exhuasting it is, I'd rather not, but seeing as I doubt you could find anyone subtle enough to replace me at the moment, I'll have to accept."</p><p>"Thanks Nabiki." Ranma said, smiling appreciatively.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah." Nabiki answered, blushing as she waved aside the compliment.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>A week passed. Kasumi continued to learn spells, but found she had a fellow classmate when Ukyou repeated one of the spells she heard Kasumi recite and promptly blew one of the unused castle towers to gravel. Luckily, no one was hurt and the dwarves and imps were able to restore the tower to it's former state in a matter of days.<p>The rest of Ranma's time was consumed trying to balance between attending to his rejuvenated mother, who was violently refusing to accept Genma as her husband; talking with Cologne about getting the Jokuketsuzoku village 'fixed up'; arranging votes for 'best mannered' among the various species (save the undead, who didn't want to be involved anyway); announcing the 'formation' of a new island kingdom to the United States; planning the banquets; and trying to keep from going insane by watching Kasumi and Ukyou throw fireballs at magically moving targets.</p><p>Kasumi stopped suddenly in the middle of practice and turned to Ranma with an abrupt question, "Hey, Ranma, where's Akane?"</p><p>Ranma blinked. When was the last time he'd seen Aka-</p><p>"SONOVA-" Ranma blurted, teleporting down to the torture chambers.</p><p>"That can't be good." Ukyou noted.</p><p>Down in the torture chambers, Ranma found the need to cast a geyser spell. Akane had actually been most grateful as Ranma had gotten her away from the overly horny mistresses that had 'treated' her over the past week. She'd converted an hour into the first day, but the mistresses had been rather EXCITED in their duties. So much so that they failed to note or care that it had happened.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Three days later, the ambassadorial fleet finally made it to the U.N. building. The flight had only taken a mere ten hours, but thanks to the time zone differences, it had been closer to seventeen hours (or was it eighteen? Ranma hated figuring out how time zones worked).<p>Standing in attendance were the best-mannered and best-looking of the non-earth based creatures. Several elves, half Sylvan, half dark; Bagor and three of his old training buddies who'd managed to survive the war; a Salamander named Hassaraaaaaacckkk; a dragon named Zone; a bile demon named Erpus; a troll named Grumble; Zachariach the Elite Dark Angel; and two fairies, Pfil and Pamela. Nabiki had twitched uncomfortably at the names and appearances of the fairies, but didn't explain why. Ranma decided to shrug it off.</p><p>The meeting with the U.N. went over more smoothly than Nabiki had figured possible. The heavily-Islamic-based governments were notably put off by the fairies, Zone, Horny, Zachariach and Erpus. Especially when it was noted that Horny, Zachariach and Erpus were actually of demonic origin, as were the demon spawn that had remained back in Harmonia.</p><p>The U.S. congress' reaction was split. Twenty percent were whole-heartedly against the idea of Harmonia's demonic-infested existance, let alone any idea of an alliance; twenty percent were undecided; fifty percent were in favor, as it was revealed that numerous animals, including griffins, unicorns and pegasi, lived on Harmonia as well (even though they'd never been included in the war, they did exist). Not to mention, those elf chicks were hot (that alone had gained twenty percent of the vote).</p><p>And the last ten percent were laughing too hard to vote for some apparent reason. One senator later managed to say something about "the coalition", then burst into fresh laughter. He was almost hospitalized.</p><p>Most of the rest of the countries were either trying to figure out if the whole thing was somehow an elaborate hoax, or ultimately uncaring ("Another country? Big deal. So long as they don't invade my country, I don't have a problem with it.")</p><p>It was when the U.N. and the U.S. tried editting the final press release that things hit the fan. The media whores...er, hoard, were nearly in an orgasmic frenzy, which could only be likened to "a plague of locusts o'er the land", reporting willy-nilly about the various creatures and trying to get exclusive interviews.</p><p>Oddly enough, the first few major interviews went not to the big- time networks, like ABC, CBS, NBC or CNN; nor the large magazines, like Time or People; but to smaller-time talk shows and magazines. Horny showed up on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show With John Stewart", Lundar spoke on PBS' Masterpiece Theater, and Zone showed up on TechTV's "X-Play" for a reason that didn't become known until an imp reported that Zone had managed to use a polymorph spell to disguise himself as human and visited a gaming arcade (some viewers thought the station had splurged for cutting- edge 3D graphics for some oblique reason). Bagor signed on with "The Crocodile Hunter" to help guide host Steve Irwin to the nesting grounds of various new species that existed only on Harmonia.</p><p>The National Geographic went nearly insane at the possibility of reporting on the life functions of Harmonia's many inhabitants and managed to sign a painful but valuable lease to explore the island with a few powerful guides.</p><p>And for nearly seventy-two hours of having to beg for reports from lesser stations and magazines, the big stations and papers finally got limited license to speak with various people and creatures of Harmonia.</p><p>A few nosy independent reporters attempted to get around to various off-limits areas, only to find that Ranma's security around those areas was beyond their meager means to ever perceive. After all, if one didn't know there WAS a door there, how could one even begin thinking of opening it?</p><p>But the exhuastive interviews and celebrity acclaim weren't all that Ranma found himself saddled with, as the Governor of Minnesota, Jessie Ventura, asked for someone to help the investigation in the disappearance of Duluth, Minnesota.</p><p>Ranma stared down at the massive burn mark. He couldn't sense any other Dungeon Hearts, but that didn't mean there weren't any around. After all, the Dungeon Hearts were capable of producing the Fog of War, which would prevent him from directly sensing the opponent's Dungeon Heart.</p><p>He cast Sight of Evil twenty times around the area and looked for any trace of imps expanding their lords' territory. After about an hour, he finally discovered what he was looking for.</p><p>"Well, a Dungeon Heart was here, but from the looks of it, whoever owned it hauled ass out of here, taking everything they stole with them." Ranma commented to Lundar.</p><p>"Then it is as we feared..." Lundar noted.</p><p>"..." Ranma replied.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Underneath a nearby town, the sound of metal striking metal could have been heard... if one was roughly three hundred feet below ground. The sound had been almost constant for the last several hours. It continued for another twenty minutes before finally stopping.<p>Had an observer been looking at the source, they would have found it in a workshop, where the glowing figure of a man stood next to a hot forge. The glow faded as the man wiped sweat off his face and proceeded to put something into a barrel of water. The water hissed as the heat from the object changed it into steam.</p><p>He turned his head towards the lit doorway, revealing a haggard man in his mid-twenties. He wore a sweat-soaked yellow t-shirt and light grey shorts.</p><p>As if on cue, an imp appeared in the door way. It hurried over next to the man who pulled the object out of the water and handed it to the imp.</p><p>"That should be the last of it." he announced.</p><p>The imp took the item and hurried off, as if it hadn't understood the man at all. He 'tch'ed, then shrugged. He didn't need those imps to understand. They were just lackeys.</p><p>He grabbed towel from nearby and wiped his face and arms free of sweat before heading into the next room where several imps were busy putting the final piece together for his masterpiece.</p><p>"Once this is done, I'll dominate this world! BWAAHAHAHAHAHAHA- HAHAHAAHAHAAA!" the man laughed.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ukyou and Shampoo were shocked. Well, Shampoo wasn't entirely shocked, seeing as she came from a warrior culture, but the news was still rather surprising, as it had to do with Ranma.<p>"Ranma killed people?" Ukyou inquired.</p><p>Horny didn't understand what the whole big deal was. After all, for the longest time, in order to survive, there were only four real options: be strong enough to kill others, be smart enough to kill others, be smart enough to hide or be rich enough to buy protection.</p><p>"Yes, but usually only the people who would never convert to his side. There were a number of exceptions early on, but those were because he wasn't good enough to convert people yet." Horny replied.</p><p>"You telling truth?" Shampoo asked, her eyes narrowing slightly in suspicion.</p><p>"When someone is as powerful as I, they have no need to make false statements. To do so would be pointless as it garners no further power and may get me in further trouble with my master." Horny replied.</p><p>Shampoo sighed. The large red demon had a point. There was no benefit in lying about Ranma. She glanced at Ukyou to gauge the chef- turned-apprentice's reaction. The reaction wasn't abject horror like Shampoo had believed most likely, but rather contemplation.</p><p>Apparently, the japanese girl had either recovered and was likely considering if she could still stand to pursue someone who had blood on their hands. Had Shampoo been privy to Ukyou's thoughts, she would have found her assumption to be wrong.</p><p>Ukyou was NOT considering if she could stand to pursue Ranma. Instead, she chiding herself for not picking up on the signals earlier. The amount of money Ranma had made, the fame he'd garnered, and even the new powers, all of it wasn't likely unless Ranma had done something violent or underhanded to get it.</p><p>"Where is Ranma now?" Ukyou asked.</p><p>"Investigating the possibility of another enemy." Horny responded.</p><p>"Another enemy?" Shampoo inquired.</p><p>"Has he had the chance to talk to you about the Dungeon Heart?" Horny queried, hoping that the answer was "yes", as it would take a LOOOONG time to explain.</p><p>Both girls nodded, much to Horny's relief.</p><p>Horny scratched his chin, "Well, there's a high percentage of Dungeon Heart users who are evil. The Dungeon Hearts occassionally get flung into another dimension instead of simply being destroyed. I don't know all the details on that, but the heart of the matter is that a number of Dungeon Hearts have come to this dimension and Ranma has to seek them out."</p><p>"So, new enemy is strong like Ranma?" Shampoo inquired.</p><p>"I don't think so, but there's the possibility that they might become as strong as him. In any case, it would be better to deal with them while they're still relatively weak than try and fight them when they get stronger." Horny replied.</p><p>Shampoo had to agree that the logic was sound. When evil was involved, it was better to take it out immediately, regardless of fairness.</p><p>Ukyou agreed with it as well, but her mind was focused on something else. She thanked Horny and left, deep in thought.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki was a bit put off. She didn't normally mind the fairies who flew around willy-nilly, she most certainly did not want any tagging along with her and her new personal assistant, Pirotess the Dark Elf (another person who caused Nabiki's eye to twitch for reasons the residents of Harmony could not understand). Especially, not Pfil and Pamela.<p>Perhaps it was the outfits they wore, which closely resembled the tight latex bodysuits of the Mistress'. Perhaps it was the way they'd make out when bored, not even bothering to move to a secluded area. But mainly, it had to do with the fact that they reminded her of the two main stars of the pornographic novel, The Bondage Fairies.</p><p>Worse, they'd become "attracted" to Nabiki's brilliant mind and were trying to persuade her to try being a lesbian. Nabiki had no real animosity towards lesbians, since she had long since become convinced that Akane was one, but she wanted to remain heterosexual.</p><p>Pirotess, at least, agreed with Nabiki. After all, she was dating a nice Dark Knight by the name of Ashram (who's name and face brought that twitch back to Nabiki's eye). And though she'd tried that lesbian thing (sort of a necessity when one was converted in Ranma's torture chambers), she'd decided it wasn't for her either.</p><p>But that wasn't stopping the two naughty fairies from trying to "convert" Nabiki in their own very suggestive way.</p><p>Finally, as Nabiki and Pirotess were trying to focus on scheduling the next conference with Barbara Walters and Lord Titus in the library, while Pamela and Pfil had wild sex on a table next to them, salvation finally came in the form of a rogue.</p><p>"Shoo! Shoo, be off with ye now." the rogue said, shooing the fairies off.</p><p>The two fairies, disappointed, gathered their clothes and flew out of the library.</p><p>"How did you do that?" Nabiki asked.</p><p>"You just need to know how to deal with them. Doesn't always work, but if you acted like they're nothing more than an annoyance, they generally get the idea." the rogue responded.</p><p>"You're... Autolycus, right?" Pirotess inquired, "Yeah, we met during the attack on Lord Tiberius' domain."</p><p>Autolycus smiled, "I'm glad you remember... the King of Thieves."</p><p>Pirotess rolled her eyes, "You were decent, but no king."</p><p>Autolycus' smile faded a bit, "Well, sure, but that's what I'm aiming for."</p><p>"It's good to have goals." Pirotess commented.</p><p>"Here's another: How about dinner?" Autolycus inquired.</p><p>"'fraid not. I'm afraid my boyfriend, Ashram, wouldn't appreciate that." Pirotess answered.</p><p>"And I'm too busy right now." Nabiki replied, concentrating on giving Titus enough time to rest and have lunch inbetween the Walters interview and the ceremonial appointment of new lords of the land.</p><p>Autolycus snapped his fingers in frustration. He'd been hoping one of them was free, but it was a better man who accepted a lady's refusal, "Well, perhaps another time."</p><p>As the rogue left, Pirotess glanced at the sunlight on the floor, "Actually, Nabiki, you should probably get something to eat."</p><p>Nabiki nodded in agreement as she finished the schedule. Lord Titus would just have to eat a bit quicker than normal. She hurried down towards the kitchen, hoping to grab a bite of lunch.</p><p>As she neared the longest stairwell in the castle, however, a blonde woman stepped out of room just next to the stairs. Nabiki noticed the woman was staggering a bit and holding her head, but as she neared, the woman suddenly fell towards the stairwell. Panicking, Nabiki quickly grabbed the woman by the left arm and pulled her backwards to safety.</p><p>"You okay?" Nabiki inquired.</p><p>The blonde woman shook her head weakly, a cold sweat on her face. Nabiki frowned. Lunch would have to wait until she could find a place for the woman to rest.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>(1) - This is where four pointed stars appear in the character's eyes and/or in the air around them.<br/>(2) - SEA-MAN, SEA-MAN, not semen, SEA-MAN!

The path to ACROSS headquarters had roughly six or seven turns with two other possible directions at each turn. She'd always wondered what was down most of the other turns. Since she was done with her report for the day (with it's consequential dunking, of course), and Hyatt (or Hatchan) had already headed home, Excel decided to indulge her curiosity just this once.<p>She stepped down on of the first wrong turns and had gotten roughly seventeen steps down the path when the building above the path was knocked down, causing an earth tremor that broke the cement beneath her feet, sending her plummetting to the dark depths of a formerly unexplored cavern.</p><p>She only managed to scream out, "I DON'T THINK I DESERVE TO FAll again so soon, you stupid-"</p><p>Excel awoke with a splitting headache. However, the fact that she hadn't seen the Great Will of the Macrocosm meant that she was still alive.</p><p>She opened her eyes to see a giant red demon holding a massive scythe staring down at her across from a grey-haired old man wearing a black robe and leaning heavily on a staff. Both were looking down at her with disbelief.</p><p>"She CAN'T be our new keeper..." the red demon began, a lot of disbelief in his voice. Excel took a brief moment to look it over. The demon was large. It stood easily seven feet tall with thick muscles that would have put most of the large guys Ranma knew to shame. It had red skin, an enormous chin, yellow slitted eyes, hooved feet and two large horns growing from the side of it's head, giving it an almost demonic look. Over it's chest and shoulders was metal armor, it wore a loin cloth with hip guards and on the front side of it's legs were thick metal armor similar to the kind it wore on it's chest. In it's nose was a thick black ring, reminding Excel of a bull's nose ring.</p><p>She sat up as the old man began to speak, "Well, she's better than nothing..."</p><p>Excel huffed as she jumped to her feet with a look of indignation, "I'm not nothing or a keeper or a Keeper of Nothing! I am the Senior Officer and Public Relations Officer of ACROSS, EXCEL!"</p><p>"That's... quaint. My name is Lundar and his is Horniculus or Horny for short. You have landed on the Dungeon Heart, thus... you are our new master." Lundar explained.</p><p>Excel's thoughts processes went so: Horny &amp; Lundar - New Servants, New Servants - Praise from Ilpalazzo, Praise from Ilpalazzo - AWESOME!, AWESOME! - Possible regular meals!</p><p>Excel smiled evilly, "Oh, this is going to be sweeeeeeet..."</p><p><b>Excel Excel - Excel Saga</b></p><p><b>Pros:</b> ACROSS gains a powerful new weapon; Il Palazzo no longer need worry about personnel problems; conquest of F City, F Prefecture can actually be completed.</p><p><b>Cons:</b> Imps aren't that useful at striking fear into the hearts of the citizens of F City, F Prefecture; Imps would turn into Mini-Excels (can you imagine the size of the pit needed to dunk all of them?); Il Palazzo would need to rely on Excel; Horny would probably leave.</p><p>Today's Experiment. . . . . <u><b>BAD IDEA</b></u></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Got something to add to this feature?
