</div>-<br/>Dungeon Keeper Ranma  Chapter 07: Purest Heart (Edited)<br/>By A-kun  -<p>Ranma was looking through the book with interest. He'd never   known that Horny's 'race' was called Reaper and that they had been the   chosen favorites of the Dark Gods for many centuries, until a warrior   known as the Avatar came into being.<br/>During a fierce campaign, many of the Reapers were summoned by   desperate keepers and sent to fight the Avatar. The Avatar's powers,   however, were granted to him by many of the other gods, allowing him to   slaughter the Reapers as if they were wheat before a harvester.<br/>One keeper, Devan, managed to use an entire army and a Reaper to   take down the mighty Avatar in a fierce battle that lead to the   destruction of a place called Skybird Trill.<br/>However, Ranma knew that was not the end of the story. He found   another book in Lundar's library that detailed the rest.<br/>Afterwards, the Dark Gods found very few Reapers had survived and   were dismayed at the massive loss of such powerful servants. To ensure   that they would have mighty servants by which they would still be   worshipped, they created the Dark Angels, mockeries of Angels used by   the other gods.<br/>The remaining Reapers took offense and wanted to prove that they   were superior. Indeed, in combat, the Reapers were superior in every   way, but the Dark Angels decided that it would be best if the Reapers   lost. After all, they would fall out of favor with their creators   otherwise.<br/>They aided humans in campaigns against the Reapers, eventually   leading to the near-extinction of the entire race. Those Reapers that   remained were too precious to let go, so they remained in the   underworld with the Dark Gods, save for one.<br/>Horniculus did not want to return to the underworld, as it would   mean an eternity of boredom, waiting for gods or humans like the Avatar   to attack. He would be sincerely bored with that kind of life.   However, he also did not to wish to be bound to whomever could manage   to maintain his 'requirements', as such keepers would be boring and   might lead to his demise.<br/>So, Horniculus decided that he would forge an amulet, by which he   could be summoned and left it in a dungeon, through which only the most   clever of Keepers would be allowed to have access to it.<br/>A Keeper did eventually manage to obtain the amulet.<br/>"The last Keeper of my Dungeon Heart." Ranma murmurred.<br/>Suddenly, Ranma felt a breach in his Dungeon. Then, another and   another. Three separate groups were attacking him, no doubt trying to   get the princesses. Ranma snarled at the audacity.<br/>He summoned Horny to the leftmost breach with some Elves and Dark   Elves as back up, in case something managed to slip past him. He sent   Zenobia and most of his other forces to the right breach. He then   called up what skeletons he'd found in his exploits and headed for the   center breach. Imps were given the order to haul back the unconscious,   but stay out of battle.<br/>Someone was going to learn the hard way that one didn't mess with   Keeper Ranma.<p>Horny yawned as he felt the activation of his amulet. He'd been   having a nice nap, but duty called. He summoned his scythe as he   appeared at the destination. He turned and looked at the now halted   advance of enemy goblins, dark knights, skeletons and Dark Angels. He   grinned.<br/>It was time to have some fun. He raised his scythe and charged,   shattering six skeletons who'd tried to meet his charge. Horny   frowned. Hopefully the rest would be more entertaining than that.<br/>Meanwhile, Zenobia and company were having significantly less fun   than Horny. The force they were facing was largely comprised of   warlocks, dark elves, mistresses and vampires. It was lucky that they   had some monks on hand to finish the vampires, but that still left the   other forces to contend with.<br/>The enemy wasn't entirely stupid, like the ones Horny was facing.   Whereas the opponents Horny was facing were largely hand-to-hand style   fighters and thus limited in their tactics, enemies who used to long   distance combat, such as the warlocks and dark elves, were   significantly less limited in their attacks.<br/>So far, they'd managed to draw out the enemy by waiting, then   opening fire with a hail of fireballs, quarrels, lightning bolts,   paralyzing ice and hail spells just before their frontline fighters,   the dark knights and monks, charged in and took out the enemies nearest   to them and ducked behind cover in time for another assault.<br/>It wasn't a perfect plan, but it was better than shooting   randomly, hoping that they'd hit someone enough to draw them out where   they could finish them off. Besides, the armor on the dark knights was   more than enough to protect them from a few assaults with quarrels.<br/>"I think they're backing off." Corwin, a knight, told Zenobia.<br/>"Then, it's up to us to finish them off." Zenobia responded.<br/>The group assembled in a proper battle line before heading down   the dark corridor that the enemy had made.<br/>Those that stood before Ranma were much less fortunate. When   dealing with the standard list of Keeper creatures, there were   expectations and tactics to utilize in cutting down the monsters. Even   fighting Horny was better, because then one only had to worry about   three things. Horny's strength, his scythe and his occassional   fireball.<br/>Fighting Ranma, on the other hand, was a nightmare. Ranma had   learned how to possess creatures fairly early into the campaign, at the   behest of Lundar and his warlocks, who didn't want Ranma taking   unneccessary risks. Ranma picked up various skills, spells and   techniques in those bodies as he went about practicing.<br/>Ranma had jumped into just about every type of creature under his   command. As such, he knew every spell, magical/physical technique and   skill that his underlings did.<br/>And he could use them all in rapid succession.<br/>A Disruption attack seared a guard's eyes just as a Firebomb   blasted him and three of his fellow guards off their feet. They were   fortunate, because Ranma then unleashed a Super Firebomb, a Hail Storm,   a Tornado and a torrent of fireballs and lightning bolts.<br/>Any enemy within thirty feet was down for the count. Ranma   continued forward, summoning imps occassionally to haul the badly   beaten, but not-quite-dead back to his prisons. He'd deal with them   later.<br/>As he came to a four-way intersection, the chattering of his   skeletons was heard. They'd noticed something, but didn't dare attack   without Ranma's permission.<br/>"Go." Ranma commanded.<br/>Instantly, the forty skeletons split into two groups of twenty,   let out a horrific battle cry and charged down the two side corridors.   Ranma marched forward, where he sensed the Lord of the Land was. The   torches glowed dimly, as though sensing the melancholy aura that seemed   to permeate the air as Ranma entered a massive chamber to see Lord   Pureheart facing the far wall.<br/>Ranma had not been clear-cutting through his opponents as   thoroughly as he believed. A thief had managed to sneak back to Lord   Pureheart and warned them of Ranma's advance, as well as the fact that   neither he nor his skeletons were the least bit injured.<br/>While the news was distressing, it was no less than what Lord   Pureheart expected. After all, Ranma WAS a Master Keeper. He doubted   even the evil yet brilliant Nemesis would stand against Ranma for very   long.<br/>Once he was certain that Ranma was not being followed by his   skeletons, Lord Pureheart spoke to Ranma, "You must be Keeper Ranma. I   do hope that you forgive my audacity, but I had to make an effort to   rescue the Princesses. After all, they are practically family to me"<br/>"You sound like a beaten dog." Ranma answered, recognizing the   tone Pureheart was using.<br/>"Indeed. Should I not? I sent the very best I could muster and   you've already pounded them into the dungeon floor. While I do have an   ego, I also have common sense as well." Lord Pureheart said, before   sighing heavily, as he turned. The torches glowed hotter, illuminating   the room better.<br/>Ranma could see that Pureheart was very old. His own father   looked much younger than Pureheart and that was simply going by   Pureheart's whitened hair. Pureheart's face made him seem at least   seventy years of age.<br/>"I'm old, Ranma. I was the first squire of King Reginald, back   when he was merely a starting knight. I'm probably five times your age   and I knew that one way or another, this campaign would see the end of   me. The heavens know I have lived too long on borrowed time, all for   the sake of my friend." Lord Pureheart explained.<br/>"Then why even try to take me on? You should be at home with   your family." Ranma demanded.<br/>"For pride, of course. You might not understand it, but I'm a   warrior, through and through. And if I die in a bed, I'll never rest   in peace. Thus, I want to face an opponent who I'll have no qualms   about losing against. It has to be either the Reaper or you." Lord   Pureheart explained.<br/>Ranma's hardened edge faltered. Here was an opponent who was not   fighting to survive or fighting for a lord, but simply fighting for an   end of fighting.<br/>Ranma had never faced an opponent so ready to lose. He   considered it. Pureheart deserved the ending he had chosen. To do   otherwise would break one of the more tightly guarded codes Ranma still   held. That of protecting an opponent's honor, when they had any.<br/>Ranma spent long moments contemplating Pureheart's request.<br/>Horny found himself standing between Lord Pureheart and Ranma.   He eyed Ranma, then turned to the Lord.<br/>"Horny, give him a fight. He deserves one." Ranma told the   Reaper before teleporting away to take Horny's place.<br/>"Nothing personal." Horny said.<br/>"Much obliged." Lord Pureheart answered, raising his two-handed   sword.<p>Maidel watched each of the princesses closely. The three   sisters were strong-willed, but once one broke, the other two would   quickly follow. It was difficult to tell who would break first, but   Maidel figured it would be Honey. Warriors prided themselves on   strength, but when their strength was of no use as it was in the   torture chambers of a Keeper, especially a powerful Keeper like Ranma   who would not face defeat anytime soon, their pride faded quickly.<br/>Maidel didn't feel any pride in guessing right as tears began   streaming down Honey's  willed the coals to cool and healed   all three sisters as they needed it.<br/>"Well, you three have had a very thorough taste of failure,"   Maidel announced, before sitting next to Honey and wiping her tears   away, "But I think it's time to show you that being in Ranma's army   isn't all bad"<br/>Honey blinked as Maidel leaned down and kissed her. The   princess' eyes widened immensely as she felt Maidel's tongue invade her   mouth. She blushed as she felt aroused by the cinnamon perfume in the   air as well as by Maidel's body pressing against her.<br/>The will to fight back faded like smoke before a hurricane as   Maidel broke their liplock and began kissing down Honey's neck.<br/>MILD LEMON SCENE DELETED<p>Lord Pureheart was having the time of his life, despite the fact   that his life was certainly nearing it's final hour. Horny was as   skilled with his scythe as Lord Pureheart was with his two-handed   sword. The two warriors were nearly unparalleled in fighting, being as   old as they were.<br/>Horny himself was even beginning to smile. Ordinarily, he only   got excited at massive slaughter, but Pureheart was a CHALLENGE. A   challenge that the Horned Reaper had desired for a long time. Ordinary   opponents saw only the scythe Horny carried and did their best to block   it, when it was Horny himself whom they should be paying attention to.   Many would-be heroes could block the blade of the scythe only to be   caught off-guard by the heavy hilt, which smashed their heads backwards   long enough for Horny to decapitate them.<br/>Pureheart was better than that. He dodged away from the hilt,   and nearly stabbed Horny through the midsection with a thrust that   forced Horny back. Horny, however, saw an opening. He slid around the   sword and almost successfully shoulder-slammed Pureheart, if the wise   fighter hadn't rolled out of the way.<br/>"Not bad." Horny commented.<br/>"Of course. I didn't live this long by being a shitty fighter."   Pureheart answered.<br/>"It's a shame to simply kill such an excellent fighter." Horny   told the fighter, knowing his own endurance was limitless because of   the pact made with Ranma. Even when successfully injured, he'd heal   instantly. However, Horny was suppressing that healing factor as a   show of fairness.<br/>"Yes, but if this world were fair, we wouldn't be in it, now   would we?" Pureheart asked.<br/>"Truer words were never spoken." Horny responded.<br/>Horny charged Pureheart as the old man hefted his sword to meet   the Horned Reaper.<p>Geld was hiding in his Dungeon Heart. He'd heard the screams and   reports from his imps that the legendary Horned Reaper was on his way.   There was no way in hell he could ever defeat the Horned Reaper. There   was that legend of some hero named the Avatar being able to kill the   Reapers, but he'd been divinely blessed by over twenty Gods and   Goddesses.<br/>Geld knew the chances of him getting such a blessing were far   beyond his capacity to count. Besides, THIS Reaper had slain even the   Avatar.<br/>Suddenly he realized that there was only silence, followed by a   weary cheer. An imp came to the edge of the Dungeon Heart and   chittered.<br/>Geld's eyes widened, "The Reaper is gone"<br/>The imp chittered further.<br/>"And now a teenage boy is standing where he is?" Geld asked.<br/>A teenage boy isn't nearly as threatening. Geld thought.   Then, he heard the screams of his men begin again, this time   louder and more urgent.<br/>"WHAT WAS THAT?" Geld whimpered desperately, hoping the Reaper   hadn't returned.<br/>"'That' would be me." Ranma declared, entering the Dungeon   Heart's room.<br/>"And you are?" Geld demanded, no longer afraid now that he saw   the boy.<br/>Ranma stood before Geld wearing red shoulder guards and a black   cape with a red interior over his usual red silk chinese shirt and   black pants with a cord for a belt.<br/>Geld, on the other hand, wore armor similar to a Dark Knight. A   solid chest and back plate with short shoulder guards that wrapped   around his shoulders. His arms were free of any armor to allow for   maximum mobility. His waist and legs were clad in chain mail with   plate mail over it. Geld hefted his sword and pointed it at Ranma,   sneering contemptuously as he estimated the boy to be of no threat,   "And who are you"<br/>"I'm Ranma Saotome. You attacked my dungeon. Prepare to die."   Ranma told Geld simply.<br/>Geld was about to snort in contempt when he realized the name   he'd just heard, "Ranma? As in the Keeper who just crushed most of the   continent"<br/>"One in the same." Ranma answered.<br/>"I don't believe you for a second." Geld huffed.<br/>"Believe it or not, you're finished." Ranma responded.<br/>Geld blinked and Ranma was in front of him. Geld had time to   panic and begin pulling away when Ranma began punching him mercilessly.   Six thousand and eighty two punches later, Geld hit the floor and did   not get up. Ranma kicked the supports around Geld's Dungeon Heart,   shattering them and crushing the magical membrane below. Geld's   battered form disappeared just as the Heart shattered.<br/>"One down. Now for the other idiot." Ranma commented, vanishing   in a burst of light.<p>LEMON SCENE DELETED<p>Ventrius was cursing his luck. Although his forces were skilled   and smart enough to duck behind the various defenses he'd created,   Ranma's frontline kept advancing at the same rate, despite the lack of   bridges; despite the numerous traps and doors; and most frustrating of   all, despite all of the firepower his minions and traps kept tossing   out.<br/>Then, bridges suddenly began appearing, followed by a torrent of   spells that could have defeated a legion of Giants. Ventrius didn't   like surprises and the sudden appearance of a cocky looking young man   and a brigade of Dark Elves was a surprise.<br/>Within minutes, all of his carefully laid defenses were   destroyed, his men had fallen and the young man responsible was kicking   at the steel door that Ventrius had just locked.<br/>Ventrius was doing his damndest to load his trusty crossbow with   a magical bolt meant to slay anything. He'd meant to keep it as a last   ditch item, just in case the Horned Reaper ever came knocking on his   door. But, from what he'd seen, the Reaper paled in comparison to this   new fighter.<br/>The walking nightmare that was an angry Ranma Saotome smashed the   gate with one strike, "WELCOME GATE IRON FINGERS"<br/>Ranma marched in and dodged the Bolt of Slaying as it sank into   the wall behind him. Now truly enraged, Ranma stomped forward,   smacking the crossbow from Ventrius' hands before pummelling the bowman   into a bloody pulp. A large vacuum blade later, the supports around   Ventrius' Dungeon Heart collapsed, catapulting Ventrius out of the   dimension in a very violent and abrupt manner.<br/>Ranma teleported back to his Dungeon Heart and activated the   magical map to see if Horny was finished with Pureheart. He blinked in   surprise when he saw that Pureheart and Horny had trashed the main room   of Pureheart's fortress, but were still fighting, despite having   apparently knocked each other through various walls.<br/>"Keeper, you're back..." Lundar began.<br/>"Just had some rivals to take care of." Ranma responded.<br/>"Well, we have some... interesting guests that have been waiting   to meet you." Lundar told him.<br/>Ranma shut off the map, confident that Horny would win.<br/>"Who?" Ranma asked.<br/>"They are in the main hall of Lord Volstag's keep as we speak."   Lundar responded.<br/>Ranma teleported himself and Lundar to the main hall of Volstag's   keep. Then, he blinked.<br/>Ten Dark Angels stood before him in the hall. They turned in   unison. Dark Angels for the most part looked like six foot tall   musclar men with grey feathered wings on their back. They had blue   skin, red glowing eyes, carried a broad sword and typically only wore   black gloves, head cap, pants and boots. One of them, however, wore a   steel chest plate and had a dagger in his belt on the right side.<br/>The unusual one approached him and spoke, "Keeper Ranma, I   presume. I am Zachariach, Elite Dark Angel. The Dark Gods have   declared you the most powerful keeper and thus have decided to side   with you. We are under strict orders by all the Dark Gods to join you   and do anything you ask of us, no matter what"<br/>"Um, nice to meet you. But, I was under the impression that you   guys joined keepers out of sheer whim." Ranma responded.<br/>"Ordinarily, yes. However, the Dark Gods saw that times were   changing quite fast, even before your domination of the entire   continent becoming more and more decisive. In order to retain worship,   they too had to change. If you'll allow your minions to freely pray at   the temples to the Dark Gods, they'll give further support by giving   you more mana. In addition, every temple that you build to the Dark   Gods will allow two more of our brethren through to aid you in your   conquest." Zachariach explained.<br/>Ranma considered it. He'd heard that the Dark Gods didn't truly   ask for much, outside of temples and occassional worship. They   rewarded sacrifices, but ultimately, they asked for little else.<br/>"Very well, Zachariach. Lairs have been made available and if   you have any questions on my dungeons, ask the imps. All I truly ask   of you is that you not attack any of the other creatures I have in my   command without good reason and even so, I'd like to be notified of the   reasons before anyone is dead. If you have any quarrels with the other   creatures of my dungeon, take it up with me and I'll deal with it.   Agreeable?" Ranma asked.<br/>Zachariach nodded.<br/>"Well, then, welcome aboard. I'll notify you all of the next   battle that we engage in." Ranma responded.<br/>Ranma watched as the Dark Angels headed for the nearest lairs,   then turned to Lundar.<br/>"Very wise. The Dark Gods rarely anger anymore, out of fear of   losing worship. I doubt Dark Angels that they personally sent will   cause any trouble. Strangely enough, I think I recall the Dark Gods   making a declaration to help only the keeper who could find their main   temple, but that was a while ago. Perhaps no one has." Lundar   commented.<br/>"Probably. By the way, Lundar, I've been meaning to ask you   about the imps..." Ranma began.<br/>"Ranma?" came Maidel's voice.<br/>Ranma blinked and turned to see Maidel, followed by the three   princesses, who were once again garbed in the outfits they had worn   just prior to their capture. Each of the princesses were blushing and   they seemed to be following Maidel rather closely.<br/>"Maidel? I thought... well, it's only been about a few hours."   Ranma commented.<br/>"I can be persuasive when I want to be." Maidel answered, smiling   widely, before gesturing to the three princesses, who knelt in unison.<br/>"Ranma, we recognize you as our master. We will do as you ask of   us." Honey declared.<br/>"Well, I don't need anything right now, but I'd like your   opinions on dealing with your father. Maidel will fill you in on the   details, but for now, just get rest. I'm sure you need it." Ranma told   them, before turning back to Lundar, "Anyway, as I was saying, about   the imps"<br/>"RANMA! We've just sighted Nemesis' forces! They're in the land   just to the east of here!" Michael, captain of the Knights, declared.<br/>Can't they wait until I ask Lundar this simple question? Ranma   asked himself.<p>Next time, on Dungeon Keeper Ranma!<br/>Nemesis, the eldest keeper in a family of keepers, will test his   might versus Ranma.<br/>But what of his family? Can Ranma defeat three keepers who   aren't trying to kill each other and are skilled strategists on their   own?<p>Dig out a 5x5 square. Fill the middle 3x3 with a hatchery, then   fill the corners with lairs, making sure NOT to obstruct the entrance  (s) to the room. This will make sure that no one will complain about   not finding a lair when there's plenty of space. Of course, this   reduces the number of available lairs to 12-14. That means you'll   likely have to make another room if you have more than one portal or if   you want to convert. This will also provide a food source for   creatures right as they wake up.<br/>When making a workshop, if there's room, dig out a 4x5 section   right NEXT to the workshop, do not make a separate room. Place a 3x5   hatchery directly next to the workshop and a 1x5 section of lairs.   Pick up every troll and/or bile demon who enters and place them in   those lairs. This will maximize their time in the workshop because   they have both food AND their homes nearby.<br/>Workshops, Libraries, Torture Rooms and Training Rooms gain more   areas for creatures to use for every 3 rows of reinforced walls (or if   the walls are solid rock). A 3x3 torture room can have up to 4 work   spaces IF the walls are reinforced.<br/>The necessary parts: All dungeons require lairs and hatcheries.   Most require a treasury, but you can get more use from them if you grab   the accumulated wealth from the treasuries you already have and place   them around the sections in your heart. The amount of cash you have   will lower, but your creatures can still get paid and if you use enough   to drain the current amount of cash, the cash will seemingly 'restore'   itself.<br/>Workshops are needed if you don't want to waste your time with   Guard Rooms. Prisons are a requirement for skeletons or if you want to   convert creatures. Torture chambers are only needed for attracting   Mistresses (and Dark Knights) or for converting heroes.<br/>Combat Pits are a requirement if you're playing honest (in a game   about evil? HA!) and need higher level minions. Don't place undead   into the combat pit unless you're willing to hover over the pit and   heal them. And NEVER place a Vampire in with a Monk.<br/>Temples are only a necessity to ease the whinings of some of your   creatures later on or if you want two Dark Angels. Unless you've got a   LOT of money, don't make more than one 5x5 temple.<p>Next Time: Properly Applied Motivation and Keeping Those Whiny   Creatures In Line!
