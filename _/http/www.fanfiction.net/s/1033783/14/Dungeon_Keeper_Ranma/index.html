</div><p>Tatewaki Kunou had often dreamed of being a knight in shining armor, like those told in old english tales of King Arthur, or a proud samurai, like stories of Miyamoto Musashi.</p><p>He could envision how the older world worked, and fit himself firmly above the lower castes, but he'd always imagined them as having as grand a time just living as he had dreaming up that world.</p><p>His favorite daydream had him riding on the back of a proud and noble steed, as magnificient as Tatewaki himself, his family house's banner flying proudly behind him, with worthy allies riding alongside him. In his earliest dreams, he wore the proud armor of a noble samurai, though more recently, when Tatewaki discovered King Arthur, he also allowed himself to imagine a shining suit of armor, with a shield bearing his family crest on his steed's side.</p><p>He had no idea that Ranma had actually gone to the trouble of recreating the fantasy for him.</p><p>The armor, while not the traditional wooden armor of a samurai, certainly fit the King Arthur fantasy, and both his shield and the flag on his noble steed bore his family crest.</p><p>The men and women escorting him were indeed worthy allies, as they all stopped to aid a merchant who's cart had broken. Tatewaki found himself joining in, feeling invigorated by the noble nature of his companions.</p><p>He couldn't help but wonder if perhaps the Ranma Saotome that had come back was not, in fact, a sorcerer of an opposite nature to the one Tatewaki knew.</p><p>Surely, no fiend like the original Saotome Tatewaki knew would ever allow his subordinates to show compassion, or respect, to the scion of the house of Kunou.</p><p>Yes, Tatewaki thought, Truly this Ranma Saotome is not the same one I knew.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Dungeon Keeper Ranma<br/>Chapter 14: Kunous and Keepers<br/>By A-kun</b></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;"><i>My Apologies for the delayed rewrite: I began to notice that I was spending more time replying to e-mails. I've removed them from the bottom of this chapter and have endeavored to fill the actual story out. Unfortunately, it's going to be wrapping up quickly, since I have to admit that most of the series was either watching Ranma decimate enemies or make new allies.</i></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Akane was calmer. She wasn't HAPPY, but she was calmer. She'd actually gotten it into her thick skull that Ranma now had numerous followers, most of whom were fanatical in their devotion, just as she was in herself.(1)<p>So, she just had to be careful not to piss off the ones in the black latex. Especially, since most of them seemed to lick their lips and smile widely whenever they saw her. Almost as if they expected, nay, DARED her to try something.</p><p>Ranma wasn't easy to even catch sight of, which also made it difficult for her to talk to him and subsequently get mad and hit him with her mallet. If only he'd stay perfectly still, like those bricks she always punched, or if he was like those boys from school(2), she could give him the thrashing he so deserved.</p><p>All of the minions that she'd seen were either disgusting, (3) strange (4), or annoyingly gorgeous.(5) She'd done her level best to avoid most of them (particularly the mistresses and fairies), but she'd run into a few REALLY creepy ones by accident. The incident with Pfil and Pamela had been QUITE embarrassing, especially when Prince Daniel had inquired about the stains on her sleeves.(6)</p><p>The fact that her fellow homeworld humans were present was comforting, at least. That meant there would be all sorts of trouble for Ranma, which he deserved for all he did to her, albeit indirectly.</p><p>The roaming reporters were a bit weird, though. She'd run across a few, and when she tapped them on the shoulder to ask them what they were looking for, they threw down their cameras and ran off weeping.(7) She didn't understand why, though.</p><p>Shampoo and Ukyou were present as well, souring Akane's mood. But, they weren't getting much more attention from him than she was. And at least, a certain someone wasn't-</p><p>"OH HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO! WHERE, OH WHERE, IS MY DARLING RANMA?" Kodachi Kuno, the Black Rose of St. Hebereke's School of Psychopathic Gymnasts,(8) asked as she bounded across the courtyard. Akane suddenly got an evil thought. What if Kodachi saw the Mistresses? She grinned evilly and hurried downstairs to watch the fun.</p><p>Kodachi flung open the doors to the main hallway and was greeted by the sight of a small convention of Mistresses, who were currently betting how long it would take for Akane Tendo to get into trouble, and also bartering for an earlier shot at her.</p><p>Akane stood on a nearby staircase, huffing a bit, but eager to see how Kodachi would react, just as the crazed sister of the True Blunder of Furinkan High threw open the doors.</p><p>Kodachi surveyed the group slowly, as if staring in complete and utter astonishment. Akane waited eagerly for Kodachi to say something to the tune of, "HOW DARE YOU TROLLOPS GET NEAR MY BELOVED RANMA IN SUCH TRAMPY OUTFITS!"</p><p>Akane couldn't have been more surprised by what happened if a Demon Spawn tried to french kiss her again.</p><p>"WHERE did you get that LOVELY outfit?" Kodachi squealed, her eyes shining with girlish delight.</p><p>Akane facefaulted so hard, the staircase would have an impression of her face for about six days (when the dwarves would replace the step and destroy it out of horror).</p><p>It figured that the one girl that Akane could always count on being considered more insane and violent than herself wouldn't react how she wanted her to.</p><p>But wait... what if Kodachi found out that the mistresses had slept with Ranma?</p><p>"They've had sex with Ranma!" Akane yelled out.(9)</p><p>Kodachi looked up to see Akane standing on a staircase behind the wonderful women she was talking to. She snorted, "As if I would take the word of a commoner and liar, such as yourself, Akane Tendo."</p><p>Akane flared at being called a liar and, not seeing the look of unrestrained glee that appeared on the faces of several mistresses, charged Kodachi.</p><p>In a flurry of snaps, Akane found herself bound and gagged at Kodachi's feet, the gymnast brandishing her usual ribbon.</p><p>"Hmmm, if only I had some heels to drive in her back..." Kodachi mused.</p><p>"Want mine?" a mistress offered, clearly impressed with Kodachi's control of her flimsy-looking ribbon. After all, binding someone with a whip was one thing, but doing it with a thin silk ribbon was quite another.</p><p>"How about we get our new friend her own outfit while Akane spends time in the torture chamber?" Nausica said, placating the group.</p><p>Kodachi's eyes glimmered with almost orgasmic glee. It seemed that things that interested her at home were more than legal in Harmonia. She didn't resist as the convention of women began escorting her and Akane downstairs into the dungeon.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Dark Gods were sometimes fickle. While most could see the obvious advantage to falling in line behind a awesomely powerful warrior-mage, like Ranma Saotome, there were still some who ached for the days when sacrifices were more common and generally involved a soul or at least some blood.<p>As such, there were three who sought to find one of the other keepers to back. Of course, were any of them to do such things alone, their fellow dieties would swiftly put them down. However, an organized resistance was less obvious and even so, the other dark gods may overlook it in an effort to keep things peaceful, even for a little bit.</p><p>Havoc was not the eldest, nor the youngest in the newly formed separatist group. He was, however, not terribly original with his flaming demon appearance. He resembled the Reapers greatly, only his mouth was almost never open. He saved that for snacking on souls or fresh sacrifices.</p><p>Eletrunus was a "goddess" by physical terms. She had pale white skin, with long golden hair that pooled around her feet, and a rather attractive female form covered by a red ribbon that barely stopped the casual viewer from seeing nipple or her groin. The thing that startled most mortals who gazed upon her was that she had white horns sprouting from where her eyes should be. They curled back until they reached her ears and then curled upwards. She was the eldest of the group.</p><p>Mockararssad was another "goddess" by physical terms. Unlike her two compatriots, she looked rather human. In fact, disgustingly so. Mockararssad had long red hair tied into a braid, bright red eyes, white catlike ears, a white bushy tail, a red girl's school uniform, and a large sword.</p><p>Havoc was shuddering with disgust. Ever since one of Mockararssad's minions had found a manga called "Magic Knight Rayearth", Mockararssad had taken on the form of it's lead character, "Hikaru". It was enough to make a Dark God puke, if they ever did so. Unfortunately, she was the most powerful member of the group, which meant she was vital to their combined survival.</p><p>Still, the only thing worse than a fangirl was a GOD-CLASSED fangirl.</p><p>"So," Mockararssad began, bubbling with enough cuteness to make Havoc seriously consider going solo,(10) "Who should we pick? Most of these guys look like weenies."</p><p>It was true. Half of the keepers were foes Ranma had already been trounced, and would likely fail to be any sort of a challenge the second time around. Especially since Ranma's forces were expanding dangerously fast, at a rate several times greater than they had when Harmonia was in it's own dimension.</p><p>There were a few that peaked Havoc's interest, particularly that boy who'd kidnapped everyone in Duluth, then consumed all of the buildings materials in a fiery display of power to begin creation on a master fortress. He showed initiative, innovation and the kind of attitude Havoc liked. There was that one little problem of his mental state, though.</p><p>There was also another interesting keeper, a female who'd grown almost as powerful as Ranma. She'd been much less merciful to her enemies and had crushed them beneath her feet. Unlike many of the others, she was neither new nor had she been defeated by Ranma.</p><p>And finally, there was a wildcard keeper, a dog, a black labrador to be exact, who was surprisingly intelligent. He'd recently gained his Dungeon Heart, and Havoc was interested to see what the dog would do with all that power.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Nabiki didn't mind being followed by Pirotess. She'd grown accustomed to seeing Pamela and Pfil, who were attached to her like goldfish poop.<p>She hadn't expected Cerl to suddenly start tagging along. Of course, it became evident when Cerl offered to help out writing things down, that her attention was more than simply out of gratitude. The heavy blush on Cerl's face when Nabiki's hand had brushed hers when the brunette handed the blonde the quill she'd been using had proven that.</p><p>Since then, Cerl had been eager in suggesting backrubs, massages, short naps in secluded rooms, among other overt attempts to bed Nabiki. Nabiki wouldn't have minded if Cerl were a cute boy, but she was STRAIGHT, DAMMIT!</p><p>The odd thing was, Nabiki was having a hard time figuring out what Cerl's position was. She didn't wear the same style of armor as Princess Honey or the other female warriors, nor did she wear robes like a mage or a priestess. She didn't move like a rogue, she didn't have wings like a fairy, and she didn't wear a latex bodysuit like the Mistresses.</p><p>Yet, Nabiki got the distinct impression that Cerl was a fighter at heart.</p><p>She'd have to ask Ranma next time she saw him when Cerl wasn't around. Which, annoyingly enough, might be some time, as Cerl seemed to have all the free time in the world.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>The knight removed his helmet as he entered the room and walked to the middle. His face was coated with sweat as he kneeled before his mistress. The sound of metal tapping against stone informed the rogue that his mistress was bored, which was one of the worst times to present bad news.<p>"I'm sorry, mistress. We didn't locate anyone in any of those locations. It seems that they have been abandoned for a week or so. There is no indication of where they might have gone." he answered.</p><p>"Very well. You may go." she answered.</p><p>He nodded and exited quickly, a look of great relief on his face as he thanked his ancestors that she had not struck him down. He didn't like failing his mistress, but there was nothing he could do to alter that fact. Their conquest of this world was just beginning and he was determined to make up for his failure.</p><p>"Kevin?" came a voice to his right.</p><p>The brown-haired knight turned to see the half-dark elf woman standing to his right.</p><p>"Oh, it's just you, Sara. I was worried for a moment that it might be-" Kevin began.</p><p>"No. Though, he IS looking for you." Sara responded.</p><p>"Any word on those locales?" Kevin inquired.</p><p>"Depends," Sara began, smiling saucily, "on what I might get in return."</p><p>"More than just my love, darling." Kevin answered.</p><p>Sara purred as she stroked Kevin's chin, "I'd like a fully detailed list..."</p><p>The knight grinned as he escorted his lovely companion to his bedchambers.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Happosai was beginning to panic. He'd returned to the Tendo Dojo and found it was empty. That in and of itself was nothing spectacular. The gang frequently went on week-long, sometimes month- long training trips in order to avoid Happosai.<p>The thing that made him panic was that someone had dared to go into his room and steal all of his precious panties and bras.</p><p>In fact, even the super-secret-ultra-hidden-final-emergency stash in the house (i.e. Kasumi's underwear drawer) had been found and stolen. Happosai began to tremble in rage, but he had no idea who could possibly be able to figure out where he'd hidden his darlings.</p><p>Ranma was a prime suspect, having managed to return after Happosai's banishment spell. But, even that brat couldn't have found ALL of Happosai's troves. Cologne, Soun and Genma knew Happosai enough that they might know where to look, but even they couldn't have guessed his most secret hiding places. Not to mention, none of them would have touched the underwear that rightfully belonged of the Tendo sisters.</p><p>He was feeling rather exhuasted when he stopped to look for the last trove he had hidden in Nerima and again, found it empty. Happosai's panic returned. He'd never felt so tired from simply bouncing around. He had to find a woman to grope and fast.</p><p>There was a midget with a rack. Happosai didn't like short women anymore, especially since during the "Great Perversion Black- Out" incident that Ranma had orchestrated (which had led Happosai to banish the arrogant Saotome in the first place), Cologne and many other old women had disguised themselves (with the aid of Ukyou and Tsubasa) as midget-babes and nearly shocked Happosai into a heart attack.</p><p>However, Happosai was desperate, and desperate measures had to be taken. He had to risk that this wasn't another "Great Perversion Black-Out".</p><p>"SWEETO!" Happosai cried, leaping down at the midget girl.</p><p>Half-way there, three midget guys leapt out of nowhere and kicked Happosai into a wall. Happosai was startled by the sudden attack, as his usual glomp attack was unavoidable by anyone, save the truly fast martial artists, like Ranma or Shampoo.</p><p>Happosai pulled himself from the crater and glared at his attackers.</p><p>And stopped cold.</p><p>Roughly seventy miniature male Ranma Saotomes were surrounding the tiny martial arts master, all cracking their knuckles and glaring at Happosai with that same hatred that the original Ranma bore for the ancient pervert.</p><p>The group was about to swarm him when the shock of all of the angry mini-Ranmas, combined with the lack of contact with anything feminine, caused the ancient master to finally succumb to death's tyrannical grasp.</p><p>Happosai Yagyu, ancient martial arts master, grand pervert, exiled relative of the famous Yagyu family, was dead.(11)</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Despite the recent bout of fun and the surprisingly smooth assimilation of Earth and Harmonia, things were not looking well for Ranma.<p>He had yet to track down the Keeper responsible for Duluth, but he HAD found several other keepers. The united force of Harmonia was working covertly to take down all of them, but he was plagued with requests for interviews, various inquiries about what connection he had with whoever had destroyed Duluth from Governor Ventura, and he was stuck trying to balance his attention between Maidel, Ukyou, Shampoo, Akane and now Kodachi, and as well as deal with the fact that he was going to be meeting Tatewaki Kunou again in about an hour.</p><p>Sometimes, he wished he'd just left Harmonia where it belonged. However, he knew the fanaticism of his followers would eventually bring them to Earth anyway, so it was better to deal with all this when he was there and prepared than to explain things afterward.</p><p>Things were going to remain exhuasting for quite a while. He had to deal with all of those other pesky Dungeon Keepers who were going to use their powers for evil before the War of the Keepers engulfed his homeworld as well.</p><p>"RANMA!" came an old, familiar angry voice that Ranma was actually glad to hear.</p><p>He turned to face his arch-rival, Ryoga Hibiki, who had his traditional snarl on, like just before he made an almost insane accusation, like he was about to, "How DARE YOU trick me into sitting in a fridge! Because of you, I'VE SEEN CANADA! AND MEXICO! AND DISNEY WORLD!"</p><p>"Did you have fun?" Ranma inquired calmly.</p><p>"Actually, I did. Canada had a nice resturaunt that I can't remember the name of, I found some good gorditas in Mexico, and at Disney World, I found this one ride where you-NEVER YOU MIND!" Ryoga retorted.</p><p>"Ryoga, how could I have tricked you into sitting in a fridge?" Ranma inquired.</p><p>Ryoga fumbled. Now that he was face to face with the genuine article, the mini-alien Ranmas seemed like a hypothermic hallucination (he'd had a few of those while in the fridge, like one where he had piloted something called the Kakuseijin and this girl with large boobs named Hinoki had a passive-aggressive affection towards him (largely passive) and constantly put her own intelligence down while saying he was much smarter than her).(12) But once he began to try and voice the argument, it fell apart rather easily.</p><p>"Well... I guess it doesn't really make any sense." Ryoga admitted, though it sounded more like he was admitting to lying about the places he'd gone to, which was the thing he wasn't lying about.</p><p>"Anyway, you lookin' for a fight?" Ranma asked.</p><p>"Not really," Ryoga answered, still feeling a bit embarrassed about the whole false accusation.</p><p>"Well, you know, I've gotten a few cool new abilities since I was away. Learned some magic even." Ranma began.</p><p>Ryoga's eyes lit up, the way a little boy's does when he hears that a kid who's friendless has a sweet video game system, and he quickly buddied up to Ranma.</p><p>"Hey, buddy, long time no see, right?" Ryoga asked rhetorically, failing to note how ridiculous he looked trying to act like they were best friends who'd just met again after being apart for a month.</p><p>"Well, nothing that can cure Jusenkyo, or nothin', but I think I could help you out in the ole' direction angle." Ranma answered.</p><p>"Really? You aren't just pullin' my chain?" Ryoga asked. Next to his direction problems, his Jusenkyo curse was actually the least of his problems. After all, if one couldn't tell which way they were facing, they couldn't really hope to dodge water.</p><p>"Yeah. See, I got this magical artifact, see, and I can find anyone who's an ally of mine and move them how I see fit." Ranma responded. He was fibbing a bit. His Dungeon Heart wouldn't let him move people TO any place his imps hadn't claimed, but he COULD always pull people loyal to him FROM any place he wanted.</p><p>"Ally?" Ryoga asked. It sounded nice, but did he really want to give RANMA control over where he could or couldn't go? Then again, at least Saotome would be less random than his own sense of direction.</p><p>Ranma suddenly felt quite evil as he realized that Ryoga was technically neutral to him. He'd have to be... converted.</p><p>"Ryoga, buddy, I'm gonna do you a huge favor. See, the best way to prove that you're an ally is to talk with a few girls that I know..." Ranma began, grinning like the cat that ate the canary, shat on the carpet, stole a priceless diamond and managed to blame it on the horse.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Soun was a bit anxious, not that he liked to admit it. He and Genma had packed on quite a few pounds since arriving in Harmonia. Despite the good food, friendly people and the great luxury that he was enjoying, he was eager to get back to Japan and drop some of his recently gained weight.<p>Then, a friendly wizard named Greylle had taken it upon himself to try and help Soun out of a few of those legitimately gained pounds.</p><p>However, as he and Greylle approached the wizard's research and experiment room, he was beginning to have second thoughts about the whole deal, especially when Greylle mentioned he had several processes in mind and wanted to test them all.</p><p>As he and Greylle entered the wizard's chosen destination, he noticed a few things that seemed quite out of place. Namely three torture racks, one with water and the other two with hot coals, an electric chair, a hen house, and three women. The water torture rack and one of the hot coal racks were mounted to the wall, while the last one was mounted on the floor.</p><p>The first woman had short platinum hair. Her eyes were closed, in a kind of creepy way, but her chest was ample enough that he could tell she had "fine attributes" despite the fact that she was wearing a blue robe.</p><p>The next girl had fairly short black hair, but a long bang on the left side of her face in an almost Lain-ish pattern (he really had to stop watching anime whenever Kasumi turned it on). She was the tallest of the trio, but there was something distinctly WRONG about her aura. She wore a black robe.</p><p>The last girl had short black hair as well, with a long bang on each side of her face. A black cat sat perched on her shoulder. Her eyes were almost glazed over, but he could tell that it wasn't from a lack of focus, but rather a lack of interest. She was the shortest and wore a red robe.</p><p>"You finally found a test subject." the third girl spote up, "Now we can begin."</p><p>Soun panicked when the girl picked up a wicked-looking knife, then sighed inwardly as she sheathed it. The first woman spoke up, a wicked smile on her face, "Looks like you get to remain a man, Greylle."</p><p>With that, the woman burst into manical laughter.</p><p>"Not funny, Kitsune." Greylle answered. He muttered something about 'Tortiilu' or something to that effect.(13)</p><p>"Besides, that's not even as funny as what I threatened to do to him." the second woman spoke up.</p><p>"True, Haruka, but where WOULD you get an elephant at this time of day?" the third woman answered.</p><p>"Where else, Kanako? The usual place." Kitsune concluded, nodding as if it were common knowledge.</p><p>Soun had tried to creep out before the group had noticed, but apparently, Greylle or one of the girls had placed a spell on the door to make it immune to all his efforts to open it and/or break it down. He knew Genma was probably having a grand time still. His friend never seemed to worry.</p><p>Meanwhile, actively proving Soun Tendo's assumptions wrong, Genma Saotome was a desperate, if now painfully overweight, man. His wife had been returned to the age he'd married her at and was refusing to acknowledge him as her rightful husband.</p><p>That was a problem, as Genma's family was the lesser family. If he and Nodoka were divorced, she would retain the Saotome name, meaning she would have the final say in any engagement made by Genma.</p><p>And considering that Soun had put up with him, his son and their insatiable appetites for a good year and a half, Genma NEEDED to honor that promise, otherwise Soun would come after him with a bill for the food, rent and other amennities that Genma had enjoyed. Genma had almost no money in his personal bank accounts, neither Ranma or Nodoka would loan him any, and Soun knew most of Genma's tricks, meaning the fat martial artist had a very low chance of getting away.</p><p>So, the plan was to woo Nodoka again, get re-married or at least get her to acknowledge him again, and then force Ranma and Akane to marry.</p><p>It was all so simple!</p><p>The only problem was that he hadn't actually "woo'ed" Nodoka the first time. The marriage had been arranged, just like Ranma's engagement to the Tendo sisters. And he doubted that his own parents were willing to put up with the effort of re-arranging that arranged marriage. Especially since Nodoka's parents were dead, which meant they'd have to have some sort of court-ordered seance, after explaining in detail, all of the mitigating circumstances.</p><p>Atsuko Toshiba was the only girl who'd actually liked him when he was younger, but the instant they both found out about the arranged marriage, she'd blown up in his face, seething like a man who'd just killed several "friends" who'd tried to murder him instead. Genma had only ever seen that look in one cartoon since then (The Venture Bros. on Cartoon Network).</p><p>He COULD have used whatever manner he'd used to woo Atsuko to try and get Nodoka back. The thing was, he wasn't sure what had drawn her to him in the first place. The scroll he had once given Ranma to read on dating advice was actually a present from Nodoka's grandfather to him in an effort to smooth over the marital differences.</p><p>In the back of his mind, a part of Genma was beginning to see why his schemes to get Ranma and Akane together never worked.</p><p>And unfortunately, he knew that Soun's marriage had been arranged as well, only his wife had been happier with the whole shebang.</p><p>Just as he began to wonder WHO he could talk to, Nodoka came walking by.</p><p>It was probably an accident, maybe his brain short-circuited, maybe he tried to relate it to a similar situation, maybe it was because of the lunar positioning or perhaps it was due to El Nino.</p><p>But saying, "I've got a hundred thousand yen in my pocket that says you'd like a ride on my family sausage" was probably NOT the wisest choice for lines to get back into Nodoka's good graces.</p><p>Especially since she kicked him in the balls repeatedly as an instantaneous response.</p><p>That sealed it. He needed Tendo's advice. His friend had at least ENJOYED his married life.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Ranma bowed to Tatewaki Kunou as the samurai-turned-negiotiator entered the room. Having dealt with various diplomats, Ranma had begrudgingly gained a respect for the power of speech that Nabiki could wield. And once he'd found out how drastically different things could turn out when even talking to people that one didn't like, managing to solve his problems with Tatewaki was like basic math.<p>Tatewaki grew up in a powerful family, where he was treated with high honors from those beneath him. Though Ranma was originally loathe to admit it, the Kunou family remained a powerful family with great influence. Thus, treating Kun-er, Tatewaki with the respect reserved for someone at his social station went a long way towards easing their differences.</p><p>"Kunou-sempai, it is an honor to speak with you again." Ranma began, motioning Tatewaki to a seat. Though he'd originally hoped to have a traditional Japanese room set up in the castle, Ranma had been forced to scrap that plan due to lack of time. So, he'd instead opted to go with the formal meeting room, a lavish hall that could hold a several tables and dozens of chairs quite easily.</p><p>The hall had the Kunou family banner on the side that Tatewaki had entered from and the Saotome family banner on Ranma's side. The table Ranma was sitting at was a moderate-sized solid oak table with a fine red silk tablecloth and three golden candleholders, with lit red candles in each.</p><p>Tatewaki sat down and gazed at the boy, nay, the man across from him with more than a bit of curiousity. Tatewaki began, "Though I am struck with awe that you have given me a worthy greeting, I must inquire as to your true identity. You have the face of Ranma Saotome, yet, Ranma has never greeted me in such a formal fashion, save for when he desires something from me. And I doubt, for one who is quite favored by virtually every other country, that you would see anything I possess as something you desire."</p><p>Ranma considered what Tatewaki had said. He could try and prove his true identity to Tatewaki, but that would show disrespect and Ranma was trying to maintain his formality. Then, a plan formed in his head. If it worked... Ranma looked as though something had dawned on him.</p><p>"Beg my pardon, but that's impossible, Kunou-sempai. I have never spoken to you in a disrespectful fashion unless... unless this is not my true homeworld!" Ranma exclaimed, standing and looking quite pained, "Everyone else seemed very much the same, but if you, Kunou- sempai, are convinced that I am not the Ranma Saotome you knew, I must find the one you knew and return him immediately-"</p><p>"That's not really necessary!" Tatewaki blurted out, before calming down, "I'm sure he has taken your place and will come to respect me as you do."</p><p>Bingo. Ranma managed to hide his grin.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>(1) - Akane still believes that she is God Queen Empress of Martial Arts, able to stomp anyone who gets in her way just because she has a hissy fit, and smarter than everyone combined.

Everyone's eyes snapped wide open as they tried to figure out who's voice it was and their eyes widened further as they realized who said voice belonged to.<p>"It couldn't be..." Soun began.</p><p>"It is! Ranma!" Kasumi declared, standing up just as Ranma entered their view.</p><p>Then, just as the two families were about to do a combined group hug, the moment was spoiled by Ranma extending a hand towards Genma, who began to choke and grab at his throat as he levitated upwards.</p><p>Seconds later, Genma's corpse dropped to the ground.</p><p>"Who else wants some?" Ranma asked, sneering at the Tendos.</p><p>A soft thump of something small and brown hitting the floor near Genma's corpse revealed Happosai's location. The wizaned master knew when he was in deep shit and tried to dodge, but Ranma's newly acquired Force Powers were not fooled by his quick motions.</p><p>Five seconds later, Happosai was dead on the ground as well.</p><p>"Uh, Ranma? You feeling okay?" Akane asked, before noticing the rest of the survivors had already backed away and bowed, rather than face Ranma's mysterious Lucas Arts-esque powers.</p><p>Ranma's eyes met Akane's. For a split second, Akane had hope that she still had an effect on Ranma. Then, in the next, she realized what sort of effect she would have.</p><p>Akane didn't levitate or start choking, but Ranma's force powers had her reliving all the times she beat on Ranma, from Ranma's view point, in rapid succession and with vivid detail to the pain.</p><p>She crumpled to the ground.</p><p>Then, Ranma tugged on a leash and Ukyou entered the room. She was wearing a stylized golden bikini that barely covered anything and a loincloth.</p><p>"Hi, guys!" Ukyou said, cheerfully.</p><p>"Ukyou? Why are you so happy?" Akane demanded through the painful memory of her pounding on Ranma's skull with her mallet. The chef had pulled nasty tricks and hit Ranma as well.</p><p>"Easy! Ranma forgave me after I-" Ukyou began.</p><p>Just then, a low-flying plane's lengthy roar drowned out two minutes of Ukyou's speech.</p><p>"-thought they would throw us out, but they didn't and that salad was the most delicious I've ever had. I can't wait for another one." Ukyou finished.</p><p>"I'm not wasting my time-" Ranma started to say.</p><p>"The latest issue of Sea Man is in! YAY!" came the sudden cry of a child.</p><p>"-clean like the rest of the mistresses." Ranma concluded.</p><p>"So, are you going to make them all your bitches?" Ukyou inquired.</p><p>"Duh. I'm EVIL, after all." Ranma explained.</p><p>"Hi everyone!" Orion, uber-dragon half-vampire ninja cyborg from outer space cursed by a powerful artifact named after an item in a Sonic game from A-kun's very first fanfic, said as he walked in.</p><p>Five nanoseconds later, he was dead from a gunshot wound shaped like Akane, because Ranma had loaded Akane into a magical gun and shot her through him.</p><p>"I'm not THAT evil." Ranma noted to the Author.</p><p>"Eeewww!" Akane said, now covered in over-powered self-indulgent avatar guts.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;">Omake Feature: <i>Unlikely Keeper Duels!</i></p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p style="text-align:center;"><u><b>Excel Excel</b></u> versus <u><b>Naga the White Serpent</b></u></p><p><u>Forces:</u><br/><i><b>Excel</b></i><i> - Hyatt, Ilpalazzo, Chibi-Excels</i><br/><i><b>Naga</b></i><i> - Lina, Galda (from Slayers Dragon Slave, hired), Chibi- Nagas</i></p><p style="text-align:center;"><u><b>FIGHT!</b></u></p><p>The Chibi-Excels and Chibi-Nagas weren't doing much damage to each other.

Naga reeled back to let out her customary laugh when Excel burst out of the ice with the force of her will and leapt at the scantily clad sorceress with a battlecry of, "EXCEL PUNCH!"</p><p>Lina unleashed a Dragon Slave at Ilpalazzo, but his bishounen aura of smooth deflected a majority of the blast and absorbed the rest. Well, his aura of smooth and his personal crystalline deflector array. Lina went in for close combat and found herself an even match for the silver-haired overlord. Ilpalazzo arched an eyebrow in intrigue.

Luckily, Ami can restore their teeth, but they lose them again and again whenever they see the far too adorable Chibi-Amis who perform super adorable dances when claiming land.
