</div>-<br/>Dungeon Keeper Ranma  Chapter 02: The Hunt Begins  By A-kun  -<p>Lord Antonius was dead. It felt strange to Ranma. The deaths  of the dwarves had unnerved him, but the death of Antonius, one he  himself had commanded, didn't feel as unnerving.<br/>In fact, Ranma was almost pleased with it, which made him a bit   nauseaous. He'd been ignoring the deaths of the dwarves as they had   been accidental. It wasn't Ranma's fault that his goblins had reacted   instinctively to their age-old enemies. But Antonius was someone Ranma  had personally commanded the death of. It should have been   significantly more disturbing, yet it wasn't.<br/>With it's primary guardian dead, Horny had retrieved the first   Portal Gem without any trouble. When it was brought back to Ranma, he   was surprised to see such a large gem. It was easily bigger than even   Horny's head and was shaped like a spinning top, only with more edges.   Ranma was also surprised to find out that it was light. Almost as   light as a pillow.<br/>"With this gem, you will be able to detect the presense and   location of other portal gems." Lundar stated.<br/>Ranma quirked an eyebrow, "How do I do that"<br/>"You need but close your eyes and focus on the gem's power."   Lundar explained.<br/>Ranma nodded. He closed his eyes and almost instantly could feel   the energy around the portal gem. As he got a feel for the energy, he   began sensing other gems. At least five were nearby. "The nearest   portal gem is... THERE"<br/>The Dungeon Map flickered and changed to show a man in armor   similar to Lord Antonius pacing around a room with dwarves fooling him.<br/>"That is Lord Darius. Unlike Antonius, he will keep more   warriors with him. But, while his dwarves are numerous, we simply  need magic on our side to win. To this end, I believe it's time to  show you how to make a few more rooms." Lundar explained.<br/>Ranma nodded in agreement. It was the short path. The short   path hurt the fewest people. Ranma struggled to keep those words   firmly in mind. He wasn't picking on the weak or defenseless, he was   fighting the strong and the well-defended.<p>Lundar was a good teacher. He knew not to fill someone's head   with knowledge before they had time to fully digest it. With only five   room patterns and two spells his first three days as a keeper, Ranma   was learning fast enough, but Lundar wanted to make sure the boy had a   lot of time to fully incorporate the information.<br/>Ranma was getting used to a lot of things. Killing mostly. He   still didn't like it, but he knew it was him or them and he was  selfish enough, with the help of his mantra, to say 'me.<br/>Ranma was also getting used to his new room. Back home, his  room consisted of a mattress, a blanket, a pillow, a closet and a  window. Here, his bed alone consisted of what Lundar teasingly called  a "Keeper"-sized bed, which was one and a half times longer and two  times wider than a king-sized. It had luxurious silk sheets, silk-<br/>covered pillows and various top blankets for the seasons. The blanket  on top of it all at the current momment was, as was to be expected, a  silk blanket.<br/>On the left side of the room was a large liquor cabinet with   numerous glasses in a cabinet just next to it. On the right was a   large bath with a small privacy screen. And on the right side of the   wall that the bed rested against was a closet. Ranma had already  checked out the closest. Numerous bedroom robes, everyday outfits and,<br/>oddly enough, accessories like armor and capes.<br/>Ranma sighed. He was getting closer to his final goal, but how   much would he change while trying to get home? Ranma Saotome didn't   lose, after all. Not at fighting. And there would be a lot of   fighting.<p>Ranma puzzled over the explanation a bit before responding, "So,   basically, what you're saying is that I create a temporary magical   manifestation of a Dungeon Heart near there"<br/>"Yes. The Dungeon Heart can spread temporary versions of itself   into any land with the aid of a portal gem, like how a vein branches or   a spider making it's web larger." Lundar explained, before frowning,   "The only problem is that if that temporary Dungeon Heart is destroyed,   the backlash will prevent you, your magic and your imps from entering   that area again, which is why you must protect the temporary Dungeon   Hearts as though they were the real thing"<br/>Lundar continued, "Thankfully, once you've conquered an area, you   can remove that temporary Dungeon Heart. But, the magic that you can   wield through a temporary Dungeon Heart will be quite limited until   your imps can begin filling that area with your mana"<br/>Ranma considered that. It was risky to threaten the Dungeon   Heart at all, but as Lunder explained, it was the only way to begin and   he could always remove them when they were done.<br/>"Well, I guess we'll just have to build fast." Ranma noted.<br/>Lundar nodded in agreement, before speaking up, "I did some   scrying the previous night to find out more about Darius. He has   roughly fifteen dwarves with him in his fort"<br/>"Fort? This guy's got a fort?" Ranma inquired.<br/>"Most of the opponents we will be fighting will have one. You   see, the king of this land ambitiously started a project with the   dwarves to seal an alliance. The dwarves would be paid to build forts,<br/>tunnels and traps so that the king's men could seek out and destroy  Dungeon Hearts"<br/>"Really? Geez, how many Dungeon Hearts are there?" Ranma   inquired.<br/>"I do not know for certain, but I know the king's men have   already destroyed five Dungeon Hearts in this land." Lundar responded.<br/>"What's the king got against these things? I mean, you'd think   he'd be trying to kill the keepers and take these things for himself"<br/>Ranma asked.<br/>"I believe it's the fear of anyone, even someone loyal to him,   using a Dungeon Heart to rise up against him." Lundar answered.<br/>"Well, I guess that's reasonable, since that's what we're   doing." Ranma commented.<br/>"Indeed." Lundar responded.<p>Lord Darius frowned at the news, "Lord Antonius is dead"<br/>The thief nodded, "I went to meet him two days ago for a biweekly   report on the construction of his new fort and I found his corpse in   the foundational area of his keep. I hurried here to inform you   immediately"<br/>"He wasn't a very intelligent man, but his skills as a fighter...   Thank you, Loxias, for bringing us this information. Return to Lord   Ludwig and report to him as well. Tell him we should all be on   guard." Lord Darius commanded.<br/>"Aye, sir." Loxias the thief responded, before turning and   exiting the room.<br/>Lord Darius estimated Antonius to be as powerful as himself. The  very idea that Antonius could be slain was disturbing to say the least.<br/>He had best check on his men in the basement.<p>Bagor was a Goblin. In almost any evil army, you'd find a goblin  or eight hundred. They were there because they were the second best  expendable creature available. Barring skeletons, they were the best  expendable creature available because they asked for so little.<br/>Most goblins simply didn't want much. Other than a place to rest   and some food, there was little that could make a goblin happier. The   more ambitious ones eeked out some cash, but that was usually to go to   a casino and have fun or to buy more food.<br/>Now, because of their lifestyle, most people thought of goblins   as stupid creatures that were likely imps that had been on a stretching   rack too long. That couldn't be further from the truth. For one   thing, imps had much bigger eyes. Two, goblins needed food and rest,   imps didn't.<br/>As for the stupid part, all creatures could be intelligent with   enough effort. Goblins, too, could be remarkably genius-like... for   their own kind. Most goblins didn't like having to think about too   much outside of fighting.<br/>Which was why Bagor, three of his kin and eight warlocks were   currently fighting several dwarves. Dwarves were stouter than goblins   and reasonably tough to beat in equal fights, but their skill was far   below that of Bagor's or any of his kin's. Not to mention, the homing   spells that the warlocks hurled their way was giving the dwarves a   world of hurt.<br/>Bagor's sword found the dwarf's wrist, forcing the hairy man to   drop his axe. A swift swing later, the dwarf's neck was wrapped around   Bagor's blade. Bagor drew his sword out and turned to see all but one   dwarf was down and that one was scrambling away.<br/>Bagor was still fresh, but his kin were badly injured, having   fared most of the brunt. With a nod toward the end of the cavern that   they came from, Bagor sent them back to their home as he and the   warlocks prepared to send the last dwarf to the afterworld.<br/>Bagor heard two sounds enter the cavern. One was the sound of   Ranma and four more goblins approaching from behind and the other was   of steel boots from the other entrance. No doubt a knight or more   heavily armored dwarves.<br/>The two groups entered the room simultaneously. Lord Darius and   six more dwarves glared at Ranma, the warlocks, Bagor and the other   goblins. The sentiment was returned.<br/>"You must be Darius." Ranma commented as he and the four goblins   reached Bagor's forward position.<br/>"And you must be the one who slew Antonius." Darius responded.<br/>"That'd be me, Ranma Saotome." Ranma replied arrogantly, "Got his  Portal Gem too. And soon, I'll have yours"<br/>"Bah! You have no chance of beating me!" Darius snorted   derisively.<br/>"PSH! You are the only actual fighter in your group. My guys   can handle them no problem. You, on the other hand, are going to be   fighting me." Ranma answered.<br/>Darius was taken aback by the brash attitude of this young boy.   Ranma radiated with magic in the manner of a Dungeon Keeper. However,   unlike most keepers, Ranma stood confidently, despite being unarmed and   in an area that his imps had not yet claimed, so he couldn't possibly   be planning to use a Thunderbolt. Darius didn't like it, but seeing   Ranma's abilities would reveal if he truly was the one responsible for   Antonius' death.<br/>"Very well. It's practically unheard of to see a Keeper away   from his Heart, but if you insist on facing me in combat, than I shall   oblige." Darius responded, drawing his sword.<br/>Darius charged at Ranma and swung his sword to slice the arrogant  boy in half, only to watch as Ranma blurred and vanished like a puff of  smoke. Darius blinked, then realized his sword felt a bit heavier than  normal. Turning his head, he stared in disbelief as he saw Ranma perched  on the flat of his blade.<br/>The next thing Darius knew, he was on the ground with a ringing   headache and his helmet was in the water nearby. Lord Darius was   completely baffled. He'd seen both mages and fast fighters in the   past, but he'd never seen either group do what Ranma had just done.<br/>Rising from the floor as his head cleared, Darius glared at Ranma  with the promise of pain in his eyes. He raised his sword high and  slashed downward at Ranma.<br/>This time, Darius saw Ranma's reaction, but he was far too slow   to do anything about it. Ranma slid to the side, spun and kicked   Darius in the chin, sending the lord flying backwards to land in the   water. A clank of metal informed Darius that he'd landed near his lost   helmet.<br/>Darius pulled himself out of the water. He was in serious pain   and he was feeling tired, despite the fact that he hadn't really done   much in the fight. He shakily got to his feet and tried to lock upon   Ranma's form. Both a vertical slash and a horizontal slash had failed   to come within even inches of Ranma, but Darius wasn't ready to give up  just yet.<br/>"Hey, Darius. No need to fight to the death. Just hand over the  portal gem and we're gone." Ranma offered, a look of honesty on his  face.<br/>Darius snarled at that thought, "NEVER! That gem was entrusted   to me and I shall not give it up to anyone save for my lord who charged  me with its protection from such foul villains as you"<br/>He charged again and thrust his sword towards Ranma, keeping the   sharp ends vertical so that Ranma couldn't simply hop onto the blade.   To Darius, it was the fastest attack he could have ever mustered. To   Ranma, it was as fast as one of Kunou's Tenbetsu Dan (1) slashes.<br/>Unfortunately for Darius, it'd been over a year since Kunou had   first tried that on Ranma and it hadn't come close to Ranma the first   time. After the Amiguriken (2) and Umisenken (3) training, there was   no way in heck that a move that slow could ever touch Ranma unless he   was seriously distracted.<br/>Ranma sighed. It seemed Lundar was right. When it came to   making deals or surrendering, King Reginald's lords were nearly   unshakable. That meant, of course, that Ranma was going to be forced   to kill Darius. He landed behind the still recovering lord and dashed   forward.<br/>"WELCOME GATE IRON FINGERS!" Ranma called, slamming his left  hand into Darius' back, peeling through the armor as if it was tissue  paper. Darius twitched, then, as Ranma removed his bloodstained hand,<br/>slumped to his knees, before falling flat on his face.<br/>Ranma looked at his hand, struggling with himself. Clenching   that fist, Ranma took a deep breath and released it. He was set on his  path now. He knelt and washed the blood off his hand, using some mana  to make sure that he didn't change genders.<br/>"Let's see what Darius' keep has." Ranma said as he stood up,   trying to keep his bile down and his composure firm. He was feeling a   bit ill and shaken, but to his inward dismay, he seemed to be getting   over it well.<br/>Perhaps, too well. It was like there was something in his heart   keeping him from seeing it as much of an event. He was giving it about  as much thought as he did watching someone die in a gross fashion in a  horror movie.<br/>Still, he wasn't going to bog himself down with it. Bagor nodded  and followed Ranma up into Darius' keep, followed by the other goblins  and the warlocks.<p>Darius' fort was fully constructed, which was a surprise to   Ranma. He figured most of the forts would still be under construction.<br/>Of course, that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. With a fort, he could  train more efficiently and in open air, allowing him to teach some, but  definitely not all, of the Saotome techniques. It was also a better  spot for his main Dungeon Heart.<br/>"EEEEEEEKKKK"<br/>Of course, there were still occupants of the fort to deal with.   Ranma hurried towards the noise and found himself in a large kitchen.   On one end were Bagor and the other goblins, while at the other were   the terrified chefs and maids. Bagor and company looked just as   rattled as the fort's remaining staff.<br/>Ranma decided that he had to defuse this situation and put the   kitchen staff in their place while making sure no one felt that their   intellect was being insulted. Luckily, Ranma had been working on an   "Anything Goes Debate Team" style for school at Ms. Hinako's request,   so he was better prepared at getting his point across than he might   have been.<br/>"Okay, calm down everyone. I'm Ranma Saotome, this fort's new   master." Ranma began, waiting to make sure that the kitchen staff was   focused on him before continuing, "These are my goblins. Don't   aggravate them too much and they won't bother you"<br/>One maid timidly inquired, "Do we have to have sex with them"<br/>Ranma shook his head, "Not unless you want to. Besides, they're   probably not interested in human women"<br/>That seemed to relieve almost all of the maids considerably.<br/>Ranma turned to the goblins, "Bagor, why don't you and the others   secure the gates? I'm sure I'll be done calming them by meal time"<br/>The goblins nodded eagerly and exited the room, still rattled.<br/>"Now, I'm sure all of you are probably worried about what sort of  conditions you'll be working under now that I'm in charge. Well, the  truth is, I'm going to give you two options." Ranma explained, "If you  agree to work for us and don't too complain about the appearances of my  minions, you'll continue to get fair treatment, food, money and you may  either keep your lodgings or ask for slightly better ones. If you don't  agree, then you can simply leave. However, since we are on a conquest  of most of this kingdom, so you might not be able to find many quiet  places without us somewhere in the vicinity"<br/>One of the younger chefs spoke up, "Are they picky eaters"<br/>"No. So long as it's not poisonous or alive, they'll eat pretty   much any normal food." Ranma replied.<br/>"Can we have some time to think it over?" the chef inquired.<br/>"Certainly." Ranma answered, before creating two new imps, "You   two stand guard here. If they've got an answer, one of you come and   get me. If they grab anything sharp before I come back, both of you   come and get me"<br/>The two newly created imps nodded. Ranma was so glad that they   had such perfect tracking instincts. They could find him in a desert   during a sandstorm.<br/>Confident that he'd given a reasonable deal, Ranma exited the   kitchen to continue surveying his new fort.<p>Next time, Ranma admits to having a dislike for killing and   Lundar teaches him a way that they could deal with most of their   opponents without killing them, but this attracts the attention  someone who wants to get into the new Dungeon Keeper's pants in a very  literal sense!<br/>Also, Ranma's campaign is going exceedingly well. So why does he  have such heavy concerns?<p>(1) - This was what I've heard Kunou's hyper-thrusting technique from   the early Ranma 1/2 anime was called (the one he used to crack that   statue after hearing Ranma and the pigtailed girl were 'of one mind and   body'). I think the Ranma 1/2 fighting games list it as that too.<p>(2) - The Kachuu Teshin Amiguriken, unlike how newbies may understand   it, was simply a training exercise to increase one's speed, not   actually a fighting technique. As you'll note, Cologne never called it   out and Shampoo, who's probably undergone the Bakusai Tenketsu and   Kachuu Tenshin Amiguriken (remember how fast she was against Akane?)   doesn't either.<p>(3) - Introduced later in the manga, this fighting style is based in   sneaky thievery. It SEEMS like mostly parlor tricks, but that hides   the crafty and subtle maneuvering. Using it, one can make oneself   invisible to the naked eye, conceal great quantities of mass, and   deflect even explosions. Unfortunately, it's not so great for offense.<br/>In fact, only someone trained in locating or in the Umisenken could  stand a chance of following a user of these techniques. It's more  offensive counterpart, the Yamasenken, conversely has little defense  and relies entirely on an overwhelming offense. Ranma knows both  styles.<br/>The Welcome Gate Iron Fingers is a manuever for breaking solid   iron locks on gates. Against even someone wearing plate armor over   chain mail, it's an almost guaranteed lethal maneuver unless the  target has sufficient martial training to withstand blows like that.<br/>Ryouga Hibiki is one of the few people who possibly could take this  technique and remain standing and that's saying something.<p>Easy Cheat: Get access to every room by pressing CTRL+ALT+C at   the same time, then type in "thisspace barisspace barmyspace bar  church".
