</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth</p><p>A/N Thanks for the reviews.</p><p>Don't own Sonic or Ranma</p><p>Chapter. 4: Strike Three, I'm Done!</p><p>Everything  froze and I somehow did this. It was like I turned a switch on.  I stared at everything in amazement; it was like  looking at a picture. Everyone in the room was frozen. That was win I  remembered the bandana heading for Mom.   The first thing I do is knock the frozen projectile away from Mom.  I can't believe that stupid pig almost  killed her.  I look back at him, and  find his face contorted in hate.  So  what.  He may annoy me with the constant  attacks, but he crossed a line when he endangered my mother.  I realize that what ever froze them, isn't  going to last longer, otherwise my body wouldn't take moving at such intense  speeds.  Pig-boy has to pay.  I rush towards him and start beating the  holy hell out of him.  Using the  chestnut fist with pressure points afterwards to maximize the pain. I  considered using the Ultimate Weakness Moxibation point but that may be harsh,  but then again. Ryouga has cross the line. I mean. Shit endangering my  Mom.  I punch him in the face</p><p>After I  finish I add a swift kick in the nuts. That should teach him.  Some hidden feeling tells me that Chaos  Control will currently be safe for five more minutes before it starts to damage  my body. I'm going to have to ask Amy what the hell Chaos Control is.  I figured it is one of my unsealed abilities  or I wouldn't know the name.  I remember  Nabiki's smug face and I still have the time, so I slap the shit out of her  several times, pick her up and toss her out the window, aiming for the  pond.  I get the pleasure of her  freezing in mid air.  I turn to Akane  and see that she has her mallet out aiming for where I was before I used Chaos  Control.  I think it's time she got a  taste of her own medicine.  I snatch the  mallet and hit her twice.  That should  be enough pain wise.  Now for the evil  part.  I strip her naked and place her  in Kuno's arms, making sure I hit her paralysis pressure point. She is going to  have nightmares for months…Good.</p><p>I have less  then a minute so the last thing I do is line Mousse and Shampoo in a kiss and  hit their paralysis points too.  Time is  about to run out…heh heh. Anywise I get back to my original position and then  turn Chaos Control off., "Noooooo!" That was my voice?  Oh yeah I screamed before time stopped very  interesting.  Anyway I can see the  effects of my actions.  It turns out  that bandana I knocked out of mom's path bounced off the wall and cut Kodachi's  long hair to her shoulders.  As for  Ryouga, numerous bruises ran up Ryouga's body as his body starts jerking as if  something is hitting him…Oh wait that was me.   Then slams into the closest wall clutching his nuts.  I heard a very female whimper come from his  mouth. Nabiki screams in surprise as she found herself suddenly in midair and  she isn't a martial artist.  Seconds  later I hear a big splash is heard as she hits the pool. Akane is screaming as  she tries to move out of Kuno's arms but to no avail.  Kuno is just groping her to his hearts content.  Shampoo and Mousse turn beat red, and then  turn redder when they realize that they are stuck like that.  I then realize the red on Shampoo's face is  rage instead of embarrassment.  I don't  care, that should teach her not to molest me</p><p>Kasumi was  the one to speak, "What just happened?"   The others look around and saw all the things that seem to happen at the  same time.  Then the usual Nerima logic  kicked in.  One by one they all turned  towards me.  A wet, muddy, pissed off  Nabiki stormed into the room, "You did this."   I shrugged and turned to my mom, "So mom what brings you here?"  I said, totally ignoring Nabiki. I know it  will make her madder, but I don't care.   Mom smiled, "I was just visiting my son.  I got a feeling things changed around here" I blinked and  chuckled nervously.  Mom knows something  and it's something big.  Also I still  need to find out how she managed to detect my presence.  "Oh nothing big, just made a couple new  friends"</p><p>That was  the time the paralysis on Akane faded.   She booted Kuno out the room and was quickly dressed. She pointed a  finger at me, "He's been cheating on me with some pinked hair slut!"  The fathers gasped and start to ramble on  about honor, duty and many other things that they don't practice…such as  brushing their teeth. None of my rivals said anything, because Kuno was gone,  Mousse was beaten and Ryouga was still clutching his nuts.  Shampoo, Uyko and Kodachi all got glints in  their eyes, which for me and Amy means trouble.  Nabiki grinned evilly, "Oh yes Aunty Saotome, don't you think  that cheating on one's fiancés is unmanly" Mom's face turned serious as she  took out her katana. That silenced the whole room</p><p>"Son is  what they say is true, have you been going out with some other girl" Mom knows  when I'm lying, some super mom gift she has. So I might as well be honest, "Mom  I meet someone, who I wasn't sold too, by Pops, or trapped into some lame  village laws.  Frankly I hate each and  every one of my fiancés" The room boomed with outrage, but one glare from mom,  silences them again.  I need to learn  that glare, "I met Amy recently and our relationship is something special.  If I did want a fiancé right now, it will be  her" I turn to the girls, "And if I catch anyone within ten feet of her, I'm  going to torture you for weeks then kill you in the worst way possible!"  To highlight my point I summon my aura,  which turned from blue to black with red swirls.</p><p>The scared them,  I can smell piss.  I don't care which one,  as long as the point got driven in.   Nabiki growled, "Your son is acting like a girl, by your contract, he  should kill himself" To try and condemn me farther she took a glass of water  and splashed me.  I loved the shocked expressions  on everyone's face when I didn't changed.   Fat-ass…I mean idiot… I mean pops stomped up to me, "BOY, YOU'RE CURED?  HOW?"  I ignore him, just to make him  suffer. I was about to speak when Mom spoke, "What is this about my son killing  himself if he isn't manly?"</p><p>Everything  stops… I make sure I didn't use Chaos Control. Everyone is staring at my Mom  while fat-ass is trying to make a escape, "Mom, Pops said I signed a contract  so that if I wasn't up to your standards of manliness, I would have to kill  myself" She looked at me then to everyone else and started laughing.  "Oh that is rich!  Why in the nine hells would I kill my child?" Then the laughter  stopped, "Wait a minute, GENMA!"  She  had her sword out pointed at his crotch.   Which was odd shade of yellow…eww. Mom turned to me, "Son, you thought I  would kill you? No wonder you hid as Ranko." she pulled out a slip of paper  out her sleeve and hands it to me.</p><p>I read  it.  I stop and read it several more  times.  I can't believe.  I think this is a dream. I pinch myself and  reread the contract.. Then an indescribable rage fills me.  I lift that sorry no good excuse of flesh in  one hand and in the other summon a chi ball, "YOU F**KING BASTARD!  HOW DARE YOU!"  The damn contract is for Genma to act like a responsible parent  and not abuse me in any way.  Hell the  10 year training trip was suppose to be only 4.  "I'M GOING TO SHOVE THIS UP YOUR ASS AND LET IT EXPLODE! YOU  GAVE ME TEN YEARS OF HELL!  THEN YOU  MAKE ME SCARED OF MY OWN MOTHER! I HATE YOU.   NO MORE GAMES! GENMA PREPARE TO FEEL HELL!"</p><p>I will the  chi ball to wrap around both my fist like a glove, causing my punches to feel  like train impacts.  I toss Genma in the  air and activate Chaos Control, He freezes in mid air and the for the rest of  the ten minute time limit, I'm using the chestnut fist to punch the holy hell  out of him, making sure I'm breaking most of his bones. I remember every single  thing this…monster has done to me, so that causes me use my full strength.  Even Ryouga and his breaking point can't  stand up to this.  Like using a flamethrower  to light a candle.  I punch him in the  face ten more times and switch off Chaos Control.  Then I see all the damage happen at once.  Many bruises form, then darkened, which  means they go straight to the bone. Limbs twisted in many directions and the  sounds of many bones simply shattering can be heard.  I watch in fascination as Genma's nose goes inward and teeth  shatter.</p><p>Everyone  watched too as Genma was reduced into a red flesh stain in less then one  second.  When he recovers, which will be  a long time; Genma won't be a martial artist anymore. I made sure of that.  A sword broken can be repaired but will  never work at full again.  I glance at  my hands, to see metal gloves; resembling Sonic's had formed on my hands. Only  they were black with red at the joints rather then solid red and like Sonic's,  they went a fourth of the way to my elbow and intersect with my bracers which  had also turned black and red. What wore oak bracers were now metal, but the  metal felt like silk. I tune my senses and found that my strength seems to have  boosted.  This must be another natural  ability unsealed.</p><p>"Son what  did he do to you" Mom said after awhile. She wasn't horrified and to me she had  a hidden smile on her face, like she wanted this to happen to Genma. So I told  her.  About the cold nights without any  blankets because he had stolen them.. The times where I was straving to death  while watching Genma stuff his gut. The Neko-Ken and how he put me in their  about thirty times.  The times he  abandoned me to save himself. Or the times he sold me to horrible people, just  to steal me back.  By the time I was  done my mom was pale.  She walked up to  Genma's body, took her sword and slashed his face.  From the looks of it, it'll leave a deep scar from left cheek to  right temple.  "Genma. You have failed  in keeping you're deal of the contract.   As head of the Saotome Clan, I hereby remove you from the registry. Any engagements  arranged by you are now forever void.  You  are no longer my husband</p><p>My heart  rose at those words. I'm free.  That  bastard can't screw up my life anymore. No more hiding behind my mask.  The fiancés didn't take this well, as well  as Mr. Tendo "But Nodoka, Ranma is mine daughters. He was promised to her!"  She glared at him and he cowered. "Ranma was never Genma's to give away. Ranma  is his own person.  I see now that you  all consider him nothing but property.   You make me sick."    Then  Shampoo glomped onto me or would have if I didn't side-step her, "Now Airen  mine!" I growled and spoke in perfect Chinese. ["Xian Pu!  I hate you. I will never marry you! I read  up on your laws. I beat you by accident without the presence of an Elder. Your  claim is false.  Never touch me again.  Or I will let Cologne know how many Amazon laws you broke with all those  potions."]</p><p>She paled, "But  Shampoo love Airen, Airen Shampoo's" I shake my head.  Shampoo turned to my mother, "You Obstacle!.  Turn Airen against Shampoo. Shampoo-"  Shampoo didn't finish when she found a chi ball right in her face, "Shampoo you  finish that sentence I blow your head off" Shampoo back away, she grabbed  Mousse's prone body and ran away. I should be getting a visit from  Cologne.  Thankfully, she isn't an idiot  like Shampoo.   I know that this can be  resolved so we both win.  "Mom, so what  now?"  She sighed and kicked the unconscious  Genma again, "We go home son"   Home?  "Wasn't it destroyed?"  Mom glares at my ex-fiancés….ex-fiancés, I  like the sound of that.  "That was my  summer home. I mean the mansion"  My  ears twitched. "Mansion?"   She nodded, "Don't  you know? The Saotome clan is one of the richest families in Japan." Whoa…today  is a very good day. "I'll go get my things.</p><p>Before I  could leave Nabiki steps in front of me, in her hand a bill.  "Saotome, you owe me a debt. I suggest you  pay it" On it was a bill for a billion yen.   I can't believe this. I think it's time to put Nabiki in her place. "Mom  do you have a cell phone?"  She nods and  pulls one out her sleeves...Does she know the Hidden Weapon Style? Nabiki  blinked in confusion, "What are you doing Saotome?"  I grin evilly "I'm calling the police and then a lawyer."  She paled. "What?" I ignored her and  quickly make the call to the police, "You have no proof" She moved as too head  for her room. I just hit her paralysis point.   "Blackmail. Gambling. Extortion. Invasion of Privacy. Oh and Underage Pornography.</p><p>I went  through her whole room and found a bunch of things, including pictures of my  girl side.  I also found exactly how  much money she made off me. It turns out Nabiki is richer then Kuno. And I  thought she was doing all this crap to preserve the Dojo.  I stomp downstairs to Nabiki, who was quite  scared.  "The way I see it. You have one  option.  Give me every single yen you  made off of me" She growled, "Or what?"   I cracked my knuckles. "I cripple you, Ms. Non-Martial Artist."    I  wasn't going to do it, but she doesn't know that and after seeing what happened  to Genma, she should be scared. Nabiki growled. "FINE! Give me my checkbook" I  unparalyze her upper body and handed her checkbook to her. She writes a check.  I look at it and glared at Nabiki. "You are  several billion yen off.  Try again."  This time I summon a ball of chi and hover  it near her spine.  Nabiki gulps and  glared at me, before slumping in defeat…hah I just destroyed her.. Me the dumb  jock just royally screwed her over.   Nabiki growls and writes the check… "Now undo what ever you did to me" I  blink, "and let you cancel the check, You won't move for another week and in  about five seconds your voice and the rest of your body is about to lock up"  Her eyes widen in shock as I figured out her  last trick.</p><p>The cops  came soon and after showing them the evidence they carried Nabiki away…literally  carried her. She gives me a hateful look before she was gone. Nabiki is gonna  do some time even if I don't testify.  She pissed off a lot of the wrong people.  I wave as the car pools away.  The rest of the Tendo family is shocked, but  I was amazed when Kasumi grinned.  It  wasn't the cheerful one I'm used to, but rather it was like mine.  "Ranma, Aunty can I ask you a favor?"  Mom turned to me, and I nod at the unspoken  question, "Sure Kasumi you can come with us" She smiles somehow becoming even  more cheerful as she raced up the stairs and came down with two suitcases. She  must have been planning this. She stopped in front of Mr. Tendo, "I hate you  daddy, you abandoned us when mother died and became useless and forced me to  take care of everyone.  I'm hate you  all, and I'm glad Nabiki is getting her ass thrown in jail!" She turned and  began to walk away only to stop run back and slap the shit out of Akane, "You  been needing that since you were ten, you evil little girl"</p><p>The fact  that Kasumi cussed made it surreal.  I  believe Kasumi had gotten rid of her mask Akane rubbed her cheek, which sported  a lovely handprint on it, "Ranma this is your fault" She pulled out her mallet  and charged at me. Before I could act, Kasumi to my surprise pulled out a damn war  hammer and knocked Akane out the room via the roof.  She carried the hammer over one shoulder and yelled out, "FFFFFFOOOOORRRRREEEEE!"  I like this Kasumi. It is nice to know that  she isn't as messed up as the rest of the family. I grabbed my backpack. It's  sad really I been here a year and I only have the stuff that I first came with.</p><p>"Goodbye. I really hate you all" With that Me, Mom and  Kasumi walked out the door of the Tendo home, never to step foot into again.</p><p>"I still  can't believe that damn panda did that" Mom muttered angrily.  I don't blame her.  Inmagine finding out your child has been abused four ten years  and not to mention sold to feed one's own gut.   Well Genma isn't going to be eating solid food for a while.  Also considering that without Kasumi, Akane  is going to cook.  I almost feel sorry  for the bastard. The emphasis is on almost.   The sun is falling.  It really is  a nice night.  No more fiancés, no more  Genma and no more Nabiki.</p><p>I was lost  in my thoughts again when I felt someone falling towards me. My danger sense  didn't go off, so I caught the person, automatically.  I looked down and too my surprise, it's Amy, "You came back to  make sure I was okay."  She nodded and  snuggled into my arms. "I felt bad leaving you alone with all that crap" I  smiled that was when she noticed my new gloves. She ran a finger down it and  somehow I could feel her touch through the metal, "Nice. Just like Sonic's only  these look cooler."  I just remembered  something, "Hey I used Chaos Control"    Her eyes widened, "HOW DID YOU DO THAT! You don't have an emerald?"  I blinked, "Emerald?"  She blushed, she must have said that out  loud when she only wanted to think it. "I'll tell you later" She took a glance  and saww my Mom and Kasumi giving her a amused look. "Um…He He. Hi" Mom  grinned. "My son is so manly, why girls just fall out of the sky into his arms."  I think it's good to see Amy blush. It's  makes her so much more cuter Amy scramble out of my arms and onto the ground.  Then she did the funniest thing. She scratched the back of her neck, "Hello I'm  Yoko Ten, Sorry about this"</p><p>Read and Review</p>
