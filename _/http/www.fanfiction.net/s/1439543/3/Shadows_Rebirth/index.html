</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth.</p><p>A/N: Got some good reviews. Keep reading</p><p>As for my other stories, I'm stuck</p><p>Chapter.2: Past and Present</p><p>"Ranma,  What did you just say?" I heard Amy say. Before I can say something, my vision changes  and I'm somewhere else, it looks like a mini island in a giant forest. I find  myself staring at a humanoid thing that resembles a hedgehog.  It was blue and had razor sharp spikes and  wore white metal gloves and red shoes that looked familiar.  The thing…no Sonic charges at me with a  blinding speed, but I realize that I'm moving at the same speed.  I kick Sonic and he goes flying to the edge  of the island.  I speak in my voice only  deeper, "You will never stop me Sonic the Hedgehog" Sonic gets up and says my  name, but I can't hear it.</p><p>The vision faded and I'm again  staring into Amy's concerned red eyes, "Ranma, are you okay?" I shake my head,  "I just saw something too real to be a daydream, but rather a memory that was  forgotten and shouldn't have been."  I  shiver at the speed I can remember, I want it back. Then it comes to me, "Amy,  I know all of you…the new students, don't I?"   She nods so I ask the question that plagues me, "Tell me then, who am  I?"  She shakes her head sadly,  "I can't tell you, and you'll have to  remember.  I'm sorry" I nod  disappointed, "At least I remember Sonic.   We were rivals who started out as enemies who became allys, but I can't  remember why we didn't became friends"</p><p>I get a  foreboding feeling and feel a tremor of intense heat, but it fades.  Amy's face sadden, "Just…just keep  remembering."  The bell then rang and  the class walks out. The instantly surround me and Amy, trying to get info to  feed those damn rumor lines.  Amy just  stays by my side ignoring them all as we waited.  Then the person I want to talk to came out.  I raise my voice and yell, "Yo'  Sonic!"  The class falls silent and  looks in confusion as to who I'm talking about, but the new students  weren't.  They were surprised and  overjoyed. Recca is looking right at me, his eyes showing determination. "You  remember me" It wasn't a question but a statement.  I grin at the blue haired boy.   "Sort of, I was talking to Amy when I remember our first fight."</p><p>Sonic  grins, "We have gym next" I blink in confusion but then it comes to me, with a  big grin on my face, "You, me on the track" Sonic smirks back at me. "You  haven't remembered yet, so you are still slow, but hey, why not?" My peers go  silent because I'm the fastest fighter here, but I know Sonic is right; I am  slow.  I nod and Sonic walks off, soon  afterwards the gossip started up again.   Nabiki walked to me and tried to intermediate me with that glare of  hers, "Okay Saotome, how do you know about the new people and what do you know  about them?"  I paused.  Should I act like the dumb jock?  No.   I am sick of wearing my mask.  So  I glared back at her and she actually backed away and I answered coldly,  "None of your business and none of your  business." Then I walked away</p><p>I walked  out the gym actually wearing the gym uniform for once, rather then sleep in a  tree all period.  I can feel all the  gazes of the girls on my backside; let them. I'm only looking at Sonic, who is  wearing the same thing, but at another glance her was wearing red metal looking  shoes.  A phrase comes into my head,  Light Speed Dash. Where it came from I don't know, but it is important.  Amy and the other new students are around  Sonic and she catches my gaze, wearing girls gym clothes, she made me think  many, many impure thoughts.  I clear my  head and walk to Sonic, "Four times around the track," He says, I can deal with  that. We walk over to where the track is, the couch there with a whistle amazed  that I'm participating., "Okay boys, make it good!  On the count of three! ONE-TWO-THREE!"  And we are both off.</p><p>We are both  moving so fast that we are blurring, but I'm losing.  Sonic is at least twice as fast as me…wait a moment he is holding  back.  I get that damn feeling, I AM TOO  SLOW!  I should be faster, in no time;  we were both on the last lap.  I never  thought I would lose so badly.  Then I  see it. It is a giant golden ring, like I have seen earlier. Again it is  radiating my aura.  Sonic passes it and  we both are in the final seconds of the race. This time I don't hesitate.  I latch onto the ring as I pass it and power  floods my whole body and my speed boosted as if I moved up a gear.  With a sonic boom, I pass Sonic and finish  the race in first place I heard many windows exploding in the distance</p><p>I try to  stop, but my feet skidded on the cement and I left two flaming trials. Sonic  finishes the race microseconds faster, but I know, he was holding back, some  victory.  I look down and I notice that  on my feet were two new sneakers.  They  looked like Sonics, except mine were black and red. Also the power boost never  went down. I feel that I can run at that new speed again, it feels me with joy  and irritation.  Joy that I can go  faster; irritation that I should be going faster. I turn around and that was  the moment that everyone was staring at me.</p><p>The coach  nervously walked up to me, "Saotome, you just broke the world record!" The new  kids had big knowing grins on their faces while Akane, Ukyo and the rest of my  classmates where dumbfounded…perfect.  I  scratched the back of my head and chuckled nervously, "Opps!  Sorry about that" I was treated to a massive  face fault.  That must of hurt because  the cement had numerous face imprints in it.   Sonic took the distraction to walk up to me, "You really surprised me  with that stunt. Next time I won't hold back" I nodded and turned to Amy who  was staring at my new shoes, "Where did you get those shoes?  I am sure that you were wearing something  different?"  I shrugged, "Well I was  about to be beaten when I saw a huge golden ring appear out of nowhere, so I  grabbed it and zoom!"</p><p>Amy give me a big smile, "You saw  the rings, that's great!  How long have  you been seeing them?"  I cracked my  back, "After I met you, I been seeing them everywhere when I was in the middle  of something and every time I reached to grab it, something would distract me  and it would vanish seconds later" Sonic turned to Amy and smirked, "I told,  you I'm not the only one to see them naturally!"</p><p>That surprised me.  I turned to Sonic "You can see them too?" I  was beginning to think that I was going crazy.   Sonic nodded/ "It's a special ability we share.  The rings you see are power boosters.  The smaller ones just add to your  reserves…but the bigger rings…" I shake my head. "Tell me, don't trail off like  that!"  Amy spoke instead, "The bigger  ones unseal abilities" Unseal?  "What do  you mean by unseal?"  Amy shakes her  head. "I can't tell you all of it, but we all have certain powers, yourself  included, and because of a certain thing, they've been sealed.  They only become unsealed due to certain  circumstances."</p><p>This has gotten really weird. "Do  you mean to tell me that I'm not using all my natural abilities?"  The both of them nod.  I grin; I start to mentally drool in the  aspects of what they say. I haven't achieved my potential.  Many would consider that bad, but it  isn't.  After the Saffron incident, I  found myself over everyone in terms of ability. Cologne and Happosai couldn't  give me a real challenge and Ryouga couldn't hurt me with one of his strongest  punches.  I thought that I have reached  my limit, when I no longer felt that I was improving.  With what they said, that means there are stronger challenges out  there, to improve myself.  With not even  reaching the standard, I have a long way to go.</p><p>"What are you so happy, you look  like you won the lottery" Amy said confused, "I mean Sonic was so upset when he  found out he wasn't even using a fraction of his true power" A fraction! My  smile goes from ear to ear. So much to improve!  I have limits to break again!   The bell rang for the class and I skipped off to the locker room,  ignoring the strange looks I was getting.   It never mattered then; it doesn't more so now.  "Ranma!"   I stop and see Amy waving her hand. "Sit with us at lunch!"  I nod and she blows a kiss. I had good  enough sense not to catch it.</p><p>Time went by quickly, not many more  incidents happened, except destroying ten more of Akane's mallets.  She doesn't have a clue.  The final bell for lunch finally rings, and  that is when I remember that Akane made my lunch. I'm beginning to seriously  hate her. I skip the door and simple jump out the window, an easy four  stories.  I hit the ground and proceed  to bury my lunch.   I give a quick  prayer for the worms to have better reincarnations for their next life.  I doubt it because I think a person had to  have seriously f**ked up to end up as Akane's food.  Enough of talks on religion.   All it does is make me hungrier.</p><p>I walk out to the lunch area and  see that Akane, Ukyo and Nabiki are waiting at my spot where I usually  eat.  They notice me and wave, a signal  to come and sit with them.  The  expressions on their faces say that it is a demand, not a request.  I look around and see at the previously  empty spot of the lunch area, Amy, Sonic and the rest of the new kids sitting  around chatting.  Amy looks at me and  smiles cheerfully.  I glance back at  Akane, Ukyo and Nabiki and they are now glaring at me. What to do? What to do?  Sit with Amy and her friends and have a good  time or sit with 'them' and be abused, molested and interrogated.   Choices.   With pleasure, I give the bird to my fiancés and possible in-law and  walk over to Amy.</p><p>"Hey Ranma. Glad you can make  it"  Amy says, patting the ground next  to her.  I sit and turn to the  others.  Celes greets me first. "Hello  Ranma.  Recca and Yoko have told us so  much about you" I shook her hand noticing that her nails weren't black but a  very dark purple.  Also the fact that  they felt as hard as diamonds didn't escape my notice. I was about to respond  when my stomach betrays me and grumbles. I felt my cheeks warm, "Sorry. I don't  have a lunch"  I rather not have a lunch  then commit suicide.  Celes laughs and  waves it off. "That is okay you can have some of mine. Cooked it myself"</p><p>I don't know why, but that phrase  scared the shit out of me. I watched as she handed me her food.  I get another pang of fear.  This isn't Akane I remind myself.  I was about to take a bite when the fear  increase ten fold.  I listen to my  instincts, and stop "Ha ha ha" She blinks and the others are watching. "What?"  She asks innocently.  I smirk "I know  you Rouge, you can't cook, you poisoned yourself the last time you tried"</p><p>The area goes silent and everyone  is staring at me, "What do I have something on my face?"  I say wiping my face.  Amy shakes her head, "You just called Celes  'Rouge'" I blink, "oh…OH!"  I turn back  to Celes who was blushing and my vision changes again. This time I was in a  space station type kitchen looking at a humanoid she-bat with white fur and  what appeared to be black and purple tights.   She was attempting to cook Ramen.   "Rouge are you sure you should put that ingredient in?" She glares at me  and then turns to try and ignore me.   Then she adds the ingredient against my warning.  When it is finish, she smirks, "You see  -, it is easy to cook" Again I couldn't here my name.  Rouge takes a bite, "Oh what was it that you  wanted to tell me" Then her white furry face turns green and she passes out. I  sigh, "That the main ingredient you used was thirty years old." She twitches in  her self-induced coma, I sigh and drag her to the med-lab.</p><p>My vision clears and I am staring  at Rouge, "You were in bed for a week" Rouge smiled, "I guess you caught me,  Amy cooked this" I grin and start devouring the food, Saotome style.  It is more delicious the Kasumi's  cooking.  They watch in amusement and  Miles says in amusement, "You see Sonic, he eats just like you do" I pause in  mid bite, "Shut up Tails" and continue eating.   I finished and that was when it came to me. "Your last name is  Powers"  Miles nodded, "What do you  remember?"</p><p>I look inward and speak my  thoughts, "You were a mechanical genius" Tails nodded and my vision shifts just  a bit, I see a two tailed fox-boy in a robot beating the crap out of a fat guy  in a robot"  I turn to Amy, "How do I  know all of you. I have been alone for most of my life, I am pretty sure that I  remember you if we had met," Everything goes silent again.  I hate silence. I was about to repeat my  question when it hits me like a sack of bricks. My dreams.  It was so obvious, "I died didn't I" They  nod, "We all did, you were the first.   You died saving the planet"</p><p>I was right. My dream wasn't a  dream, but rather memories of my final moments. "I had dreams since I can  remember. In them is always the same thing. I'm falling from space into the  atmosphere, above me is a space station that has stopped falling."  Sonic nodded sadly, "We saw you fall, and  couldn't do a damn thing to save you" The ground trembles and I see, Rick has  pounded his fist into the ground.  There  was a giant crater and numerous cracks ran under us across the whole  field,  "It was horrid, mon.  Just watc'ing and not do a 'hing do 'elp"  The mood has gotten dark, and everyone was depressed.</p><p>I blink, and again speak without  thinking, "Knuckles get rid of the fake accent, It makes you sound dumber then  Sonic!"   Sonic grins, "Rig…HEY!"  The dark mood broke and everyone started to  laugh.  My vision shifts, and I am  looking at a reddish brown humanoid mole like thing.  In it's powerful looking clawed hands was a giant red emerald  that gave off a presence of power.  The  vision fades, "You were always obsessed about the master emerald, and even  broke it when Rouge tried to steal it" Knuckles mocked glared at Rouge and  spoke without the accent, "It was a real bitch collecting those pieces, I have  you know" Rouge just laughs, "It would have been easier if you had just gave me  the thing."</p><p>Soon it turned into a playful  argument, everyone else groaned,  "You  should know better then to bring up the master emerald again." She says  slapping the back of my head</p><p>"Is it still that bad?" She shakes her head, "No it's just a  flirting game, makes me sick."  That  came from Kay, the last person in the group. I haven't noticed her.  I concentrate trying to remember from where  I know her.  She waves her hand in  dismissal, her face still resembling a fox, "Don't bother, we never encountered  each other." She said cheerfully.</p><p>The others  nodded in agreement, "She's right Ranma, you never met her" Amy says.  I nod, but I still think I know her. Kay  Hos.  The name rings a bell.  Kay Hos.   It is at the tip of my tongue. In my minds eye, I can see a screen and  on it, I see Sonic fighting a blue gell type thing. It looks like I am seeing  this on a recording.  What does Kay Hos  have to do…wait a minute!  Kay Hos!  I start to laugh! "Chaos" I say.  The others pause and Kay has both eyes  fullen open. "What did you just say?"  I  grin, "I know OF you.  Chaos.  The guardian of the special emeralds, Chaos  Emeralds; they are a huge unknown energy source that can do many things. That  was until Dr. Eggman corrupted you. You and Sonic fought many times before he  defeated you and you were purified.  I  remember seeing clips of you. I thought you were a man!"</p><p>Kay laughed  and her face went back to looking like a fox face. "So you do know me.  As for your question, I was genderless  before, so I chose to be a woman.  Girl  power you know. At least I'm glad you're not stupid like Sonic," Sonic nods. "Ye…  HEY! Will you all stop that!"    We all  have another good laugh at Sonic's expense.   I turn to Amy, "Let me get all the facts. One, you can't tell me my  name, because it has been sealed away"   They nodded, "Two, I died, but somehow I was able to come back, and you  can't tell me how"  They nodded again. "Three,  I knew you, so that means you all died too"   They nodded, "Finally, the more I remember, the more my natural  abilities come out."  They nodded.  I then remember what has been bugging me, "Okay.  One more question."  I pause to make sure they can hear me, "What  is the Light Speed Dash?"</p><p>Read and Review</p>
