</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth</p><p>A/N: Now what all you've been waiting for</p><p>Chapter 27: Spirit VS. Body</p><p>Sesshomaru watched his brother, glaring at him from across the ring that the barrier made. Most of the ring had took up a good portion of the island. More then enough room for him to transform and have room to move. He sighed at the rage he saw in his brother's eyes. "Tell me brother, why do you fight?" Inuyasha blinked in confusion, he was expecting an insult. "That's a stupid question, I fight for my weapon. I'll never let you get a hand on my Tetsusaiga!"</p><p>He then charged at his sibling, who only sighed and easily moved out the way with to steps for dashing towards the other side. "I'm...disappointed in you brother. I though all that time living with humans would have taught you something." They were now at opposite sides. Sesshomaru had his back facing Inuyasha. "Suppose you do win, and you get the title of Western Lord, what next?" Inuyasha did another charge and again Sesshomaru easily dodged. "I would like to know brother"</p><p>Inuyasha growled. "I'll go and collect the rest of the Shikon shards and become a full Youkai!" Sesshomaru was still facing away from Inuyasha so the hanyou didn't see his frown. "I see, what about our people. When will you take care of the several million underneath you? What about their need of a leader that can protect them from those who would take advantage? You would leave them to pursue power. What kind of leader are you?"</p><p>Inuyasha growled. His brother was right. "SHUT UP! I'll be a good leader!" His brother turned to face him and cocked an eyebrow. "How would you protect them?" He suddenly dashed in and before Inuyasha could counter, punched him in the stomach. Inuyasha flew back and hit the barrier. He slumped down the energy wall and onto the ground. His brother was back in his original spot. "Tell me Inuyasha. How can you protect our people, when you can't even protect yourself?"</p><p>Inuyasha got to his feet, the blow was meant only to throw him back, his brother was holding back on him. "I'll get the power of the Shikon no Tama and I'll be able to defeat whoever I want. No one would dare attack me!" Sesshomaru only shook his head. "So you'll get power you haven't earned only to cause more violence. All you'll bring to the Western Lands is death and destruction. So what, no one would be able to defeat you, what about the young, the sick, the helpless? How would they defend themselves when you have all the power? How would they grow if they aren't challenged? Inuyasha, show me that you are better then this"</p><p>With that Sesshomaru charged in, Inuyasha was struck hard by those words, but he still wasn't going to lose, just that his reasons weren't that clear. Inuyasha ducked underneath Sesshomaru's high kick and slashed down at the leg still on the ground. It didn't do any good as Sesshomaru simply jumped before landing on Inuyasha's hand. "Come on, brother. Show me?" He only frowned as he brother pulled his hand out and began slashing in a rage. His eyes was beginning to flicker from gold to red as his mist glowing markings were flashing black. Inuyasha was giving into his hate, his anger and that was making him an easy defeat.</p><p>"INUYASHA SIT!" Sesshomaru watched in amusement as Inuyasha crashed into the ground. He jumped back to the other side of the ring and saw what was happening. Inuyasha groaned and got up to glare at Kagome who was watching from outside the barrier. The other Lords decided not to call interference. "WHY DID YOU DO THAT KAGOME!" His eyes were gold again and his markings were white again. "SIT!" He crashed down into the ground again and Kagome's face soften. "Inuyasha, you got to calm down, if you don't think clearly, you're going to lose. Your brother is baiting you to get angry. He's testing you and I-I-I don't like seeing you hurt." All the anger left Inuyasha at Kagome's words. He smiled in thanks. "I do need to calm down. What would I do without you Kagome?" She blushed and smiled. "Now get up and show your brother what you really can do" He nodded as he got to his feet.</p><p>He turned to face his brother and saw an amused expression on his face. "Maybe you have learned something from those humans after all" Inuyasha ignored the jab. He cracked both his knuckles one handed in a way he usually does by flexing his hands. "Now let get this fight started. You know what brother, I will protect our people because they are powerful, all they need is a leader and I am to be that person. I will face all challenges so that the young, the sick, the old and the helpless could sleep easy." With that he charged</p><p>There was a noticeable difference. Inuyasha was ten times faster then before, often times blurring. Sesshomaru smiled as he matched his brother's speed claw for claw. He jumped completely over his brother's charge only to duck when his brother used the border to sprung off of and do another charge. Sesshomaru didn't get out of this untouched when his brother manage to rip a sleeve off his arm, in fact revealing his recently grown arm. "So its true, you have your arm back. Well it's not going to do you any good!" With that Inuyasha twisted in midair so he could land facing Sesshomaru, his claws having dug several lines in the ground.</p><p>"I've learned a lot since I last fought you." With that he slammed a fist into the ground. Sesshomaru's eyes widened and he jumped into the air. Moments later the ground were he was exploded. "The Breaking Point, you have been learning, but I've know of that move. It doesn't work on living beings." Inuyasha grinned again as his markings flared. "That's why I learned more" He laid his other hand on the ground where his fist was and shrapnel exploded out the crater and into Sesshomaru, before he could dodge, so he just crossed his arms as the shrapnel exploded on contact making a massive smoke cloud.</p><p>Inuyasha smirked, but it fell off his face when the cloud cleared. Sesshomaru was hovering in the air, but blocking his whole body were massive floating shoulder guards. They had joined to block him from the rock blast. Sesshomaru smirked as they detached and floated on the sides of his arms, surrounded by a glowing mist. "That was impressive, but I learned many things as well, like this!"</p><p>The guards joined and surrounded him and Sesshomaru came crashing down like a meteor. Inuyasha dashed out the way but was unprepared for the shield-ball thing to bounce off the ground, off the barrier and into Inuyasha. He grunted, and made a silent thanks to Ryouga for the endurance training. The guards detached and Sesshomaru rolled into a kick that sent Inuyasha into the ground, curving a path in the ground with his skidding body. "Ouch" He muttered as he got up. That had HURT!</p><p>Sesshomaru rose from the crouch he landed in and cracked his neck. Inuyasha this time slammed both fist into the ground and again Sesshomaru jumped into the air, only this time a pillar of earth rose out the ground and swerved in midair to slam into Sesshomaru. He wasn't that hurt, because he set his guards to protect him, but Inuyasha was planning that. He ran forward and dug a claw into the pillar, he then launched himself into the air over Sesshomaru, he grinned as he raised his hands and did a double handed overhead slammed into it knocking Sesshomaru down like a volleyball, as he fell he used the pillar of earth to launch himself towards the ground. Sesshomaru had got up just in time to block Inuyasha's punch with his forarm.</p><p>Everyone heard the loud crack as Sesshomaru's arm broke under the pressure from the attack. Inuyasha smirked as he jumped back into a stance. Sesshomaru looked from his brother to his broken arm. "Impressive, I guess I have to up the fight." He grinned as the markings on his arm began to glow like the ones on his face and he jerked his arm. "That's better" He said rotating his now healed arm. "You may have learned some knew tricks, but you never bothered to learn the family art."</p><p>Inuyasha suddenly got a bad feeling when Sesshomaru's eyes turned blood red, but he wasn't going berserk and transforming into his alternate state. In fact he was calmer than before. Sesshomaru reached to his chest and ripped the rest of his upper clothing off to reveal the skin tight dragon scale armor. The ridges would deflect most weapons. The guards floating next to his arms, attached to his bare arms and added more armor. What people thought to be a puffy thing but was actually Sesshomaru's Tail condensed and wrapped around his waist like a belt.</p><p>Sesshomaru grinned, it wasn't a nice grin. "What you need to learn is that our blades are nothing but tools to channel our power." The glow around his body shrunk until it was surrounding his hands and glowing brighter then before. "Take this, brother. SOUL FIST" He punched out and a fist shaped blast burst from his fist to smack into the unprepared Inuyasha. He hit the barrier and dropped to ground to put out the white fires that was burning his clothes and some flesh. After finally rolling enough to put out the fire. Inuyasha got to his feet. "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?" Sesshomaru grinned. "Spirit Berserker Flames." The glow transferred to his leg. "Soul Kick" He shot across the ring like a shooting star, his leg surrounded by white lightning.</p><p>Inuyasha was able to dodge though and he watched as the energy barrier rippled from the shear amount of energy put out. "Spirit Berserker Lightning" Said lightning was still arcing off his leg as Sesshomaru stood. Inuyasha frowned. How the hell was he suppose to get past that. He calmed his breath and began to use the techniques both Chaos and Ryouga taught him. He began blocking everything out but his brother and his heartbeat. Sesshomaru watched, in curiosity as Inuyasha went into a trance of sorts. He transferred the glow from his legs to all over his body, a duplicate set of guards appeared floating by his side for extra protection.</p><p>Inuyasha concentrated as he felt his energy. Sesshomaru watched as his brother screamed as his body changed. His muscles bulged as the increased in size. His eyes took a hue between red and gold as purple veins ran through his body. Inuyasha grew a foot and his eyes and his markings flared in intensity a bit. His breath evened out and Inuyasha stared at his brother and suddenly disappeared. Sesshomaru's eyes widened as he blocked the blow from his brother, forming a frontal shield from the extra guards and crossing his arm. Good thing he did as the shield shattered and the blow hit his cross arm, making cracks in the first set and sending Sesshomaru all the way across the field into the barrier.</p><p>Inuyasha was still not to be seen. Sesshomaru formed another shield on his side as Inuyasha reappeared and slammed a fist into it, rather than his side, but none the lest in sent Sesshomaru in that direction with another shattered set of guards. He narrowed his eyes and saw a figure rushing towards him. A blurred figure appearing at several spots but heading towards him. He grinned as he formed another set of guards, only this time they reformed over his fist and then distorted into a pair of floating metal fist. Sesshomaru rolled and punched into the empty air as hard as he can "Soul Strike!"</p><p>The floating fist hit something. Inuyasha appeared back in normal vision, in his large size, bent over the fist that were imbedded into his stomach. "Spirit Berserker Metal" With an uppercut, Inuyasha's form was launched into the air with a spray of blood leaving his mouth. Inuyasha frowned in mid air and blurred and faded away. Sesshomaru's eyes widened as he took in the energy patterns. "I'm impressed. Using a move to boost strength, speed and reflexes. That's very good" He stopped as the fist changed back to guards, before reforming over his legs as armor plating. Sesshomaru jumped into the air. "Soul Juggle!"</p><p>His legs blurred as he seemed to strike air again, but again Inuyasha appeared at the first blow and was kicked higher and higher into the air. Sesshomaru landed and afterwards, a little further off, Inuyasha did too. He landed on his knees and was breathing hard. "Spirit Berserker Water." Sesshomaru said and then grinned. "It must be hard to maintain that. It must really drain your reserves." Inuyasha glared and faded away. Sesshomaru looked around, tuning his senses, but he didn't track Inuyasha to dodge the blow to the face. Sesshomaru was sent back rolling several times before coming to a rest.</p><p>He stood up and rotated his jaw. "That hurt, you know" Inuyasha appeared again, his fist in Sesshomaru's gut. "That was what I was trying to do." Sesshomaru grunted and a little bit of blood escaped his mouth. His dragon scale armor had took much of the impact and shredded some of Inuyasha's knuckles. Sesshomaru countered by head butting Inuyasha, stunning the hanyou and breaking his concentration</p><p>Inuyasha grunted and shrunk back to his original size. He was breathing hard. Inuyasha jumped up and kicked off Sesshomaru's face to put some distance between the two. Sesshomaru was also breathing hard, showing those moves combined with Inuyasha's massive hits did their damage as well. Sesshomaru evened out his breathing and the armor covering his leg, went back to their original position of floating by his sides. Sweat was dripping off of both as they stared at each other. Finally Sesshomaru broke the silence by lifting his hand and waving Inuyasha to come at him.</p><p>Inuyasha shook his head and instead dug his claw into his arm, just enough to draw blood. "CLAWS OF BLOOD!" Vacuum blades of red blood flew at Sesshomaru at high speeds, Sesshomaru arranged the floating guards in front of him and was forced to duck as the attack sliced through them easily. He blinked and reformed the guard, this time they looked like the plate mail on his chest, suggesting that what was floating around him was now made out of dragon scales. "I guess I have to use my more advance guards." Inuyasha grinned. "Not going to do any good, my Claws of Blood can cut through anything."</p><p>Sesshomaru grinned as he brother let lose another of the attack only to splash against his new shield with no damage. "Scales from rouge dragons soaked with there blood make an armor that you can't pierce." Inuyasha frowned. "Then we are at a stalemate." He didn't like how Sesshomaru smirked. "Lets end that, you know what Inuyasha, I learned things from Shadow too." Inuyasha got a sinking feeling. "What did you learn?"</p><p>Sesshomaru grinned and rushed forward bother Inuyasha could block and went right up in his face. "Your momma is so ugly, she has one big titty and one small titty and everyone calls her biggy-smalls" He said before jumping back. Inuyasha blinked suddenly and rage overtook him. "WHAT DID YOU SAY!" Sesshomaru grinned as his brother's eyes flickered red. "You didn't hear me? I got more. Your momma so old, that when I told her to act her age, the bitch died." His smirk only grew as Inuyasha screamed in rage and blindly charged at him. "DON'T TALK ABOUT MY MOTHER!" Inuyasha didn't notice when Sesshomaru started moving in a spiral. "Oh and don't forget that your momma is so hairy, when you were born you got rug burns."</p><p>Inuyasha roared as he took another swipe, only to be easily blocked against Sesshomaru's guards. At one point Inuyasha shifted into his bigger form, but the increased speed and strength did no good as Inuyasha was becoming unfocused again and his moves predicatble. "Did I mention that she was so fat, she fell in love and broke it?" Inuyasha twitched and decided just to rush Sesshomaru. Sesshomaru grinned as he got to the center and did a sloppy uppercut. "Hiryu Shoten Ha" He calmly said as a tornado formed and ripped Inuyasha right off the ground. He whistled from the center of the tornado. It was damn big, but still calm in the eye; Sesshomaru's hair didn't even move."</p><p>The tornado kept on getting bigger as Inuyasha kept on getting more pissed off, but after a while he finally realized what was happening and claimed down. The tornado ended and to add insult to injury, he crashed down to the ground. Sesshomaru just had a big ass grin on his face. "See, I told you I learned something new." Inuyasha frowned, he been tricked. He never thought his brother would say something like that. He wiped the blood at came out his mouth and spat out a wad of dried blood onto the floor. He is going to need something new. Ryouga and Chaos has helped them out with some new moves, but his brother has been with both Shadow and the one they call Sonic and they are considered the best of their group. Sesshomaru knows a lot more tricks then he does.</p><p>He mentally slapped himself. Sesshomaru just doesn't know a bunch of new tricks, by the looks of it he mastered the art that as a child he scoffed at because he considered just sitting around thinking will do no good in a real fight. He paused as he remembered what his brother said. Tenseiga was a tool connected to his soul for his brother to use, could Tetsusaiga be the same? He reached out with his senses and found that he could still feel his blade even though he isn't actually touching at. He used that connection and began to tug and something began to happen.</p><p>Sesshomaru smiled. His brother had grown more powerful, but it seems he has ran out of tricks. His smile only grew as he felt his brother tapp into his blade and reformed his guards into shields and reinforced it with his aura. He thanked his thoughts earlier as a familiar misty white aura surrounded his brother and concentrated on his hands. The aura pulsed several times before reforming into an energy version of the Tetsusaiga. Sesshomaru watched his brother's eyes widened in shock and a grin grew on his face as he got into a stance. "Well how about that. Wind Scar!"</p><p>As if he held Tetsusaiga and not an energy version a wave of destruction ran from Inuyasha energy blade and hit Sesshomaru. If it weren't for the shield he put up, he would have been put out the fight or dead. Sesshomaru changed his shield back to his guards. They were smoking slightly. Just more proof of the power his brother had. To cause dragon scale armor to actually smoke when he's seen some dipped into lava and be cool to the touch very amazing. "I guess you forced me to up the pace." Sesshomaru said as he jumped over another Wind Scar from his brother.</p><p>Inuyasha didn't reply, only grinned and redirected his weapon towards the descending Sesshomaru. Sesshomaru didn't form a shield with his guards only stretched out his hands as the glow surrounding his body shifted to his hands much like his brother just done. In an instant, in his hands was an energy replica of Tenseiga's transformed state. Sesshomaru calmly put his blade out to block him from the incoming maelstrom. He landed on the floor, behind Inuyasha. The way both were positioned, their backs were facing each other. Inuyasha's energy Tetsusaiga was wild with erratic and was never stable while Sesshomaru's Tenseiga pulsed with his heart beat in a stable energy pattern. One weapon was just as strong as the other.</p><p>"I can't let you win this fight Sesshomaru, you've always gotten whatever you wanted. It was always liked that when we were young, you were a spoiled brat while I was ignored and shunned because of my blood. I remember the times I was beaten up or almost killed just because I was Hanyou. Where were you? Inside with all your things!" Inuyasha said calmly, his red eyes though were watching Kagome's worried expression though; he was somewhat glad to see Shippo's face mirror hers.</p><p>Sesshomaru frowned slightly. "That isn't true. I had to constantly be the model heir while you got to ran free and do whatever you wanted. What I got I earned, I remembered the days where I was stuck indoors studying moldy old scrolls while I could see you just outside the window playing with a ball. How dare you say I was spoiled when you had no rules to obey." Sesshomaru replied glancing at Kikyo, she had a neutral expression on but he could see through his red eyes the worry in her eyes. He smiled as he saw Rin sitting next to her waving at him.</p><p>Without any visible signal, both blurred from their standing positions. They reappeared in the center of the ring with both energy blades locked. Following that was a loud metallic sound that resembled a roar of sorts and a massive discharge of energy that made a crater underneath the point of impact. Both bothers glared at each other, being able to see their reflections in the other's blood red eyes. "I won't let you win" Both said as they put more pressure on the blades. White glowing mist began to form around the both of them as they tried to force the other back, but it was a deadlock. The crator underneath them only seemed to get bigger as the force of one's energy was forcing the other down.</p><p>Both Inuyasha and Sesshomaru both began crying tears of blood, had they smelled it, they would have realized the blood had their father's scent, but they didn't. All that matter was forcing the other back. At the same time, both brothers began to growl as they began to give into their primal natures. The mist began to transform as well, transparent over both brothers were two massive dogs that had their jaws locked down on the others. One could be recognized as Sesshomaru's alternate state with the groomed fur and refined look with markings matching Sesshomaru's smoothed straight ones, but the other was new. It was a dog just as big as the other, only its fur was wild, spiking op in odd places, but like the other dog its markings matched Inuyasha's jagged rough ones.</p><p>Both brothers opened their mouths to show that their canines have grown slightly and to the shock of those watching began growling. They weren't beserk but they were primal, as if they were channeling their inner natures to the outside world in their single minded challenge to dominate the other. Energy kept on bleeding off the locked energy blades and pretty soon the walls began to ripple from the force put out. In Sonic's arms both sheaths of the Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga were glowing a bright white as their owners used their power from long distance.</p><p>Another thing began to show, on both Inuayasha's and Sesshomaru's necks, a massive bite mark began to appear, matching the ones of the floating dogs above. Blood began drip down their throats as they increased the pressure on the other. Sesshomaru grunted and smirked at his younger brother. "Give it up Inuyasha, I can outlast you." Inuyasha snarled in response as he increased the pressure growing a foot to match his brother's height like the last times he grew.</p><p>"Don't think I'll give up just because of a little pain. This is too important to just give up. If I can stand the pain of being sealed to a blasted tree for fifty years, then I can outlast you any day of the week, brother" Both smirked as the energy grew around them. Sesshomaru's dragon scale mail began to crack under the pressure and Inuyasha's fire rat robes began to burn in certain places. Sesshomaru grunted and began to growl. Inuyasha's eyes widened as his blade began to be pushed back. "HHHHAAAAAAAA" Sesshomaru began saying under his breath. Inuyasha began to be driven to his knees. Sesshomaru kept on yelling as he drove his brother back. Above the dog representing Inuyasha began to stumble as the other increased the pressure.</p><p>Sesshomaru's eyes were now flashing between glowing rubies and the blood tinted look. Inuyasha was slowly but surely being pushed down into the ground. Inuyasha glared at his brother and began to push back. His eyes now flashing in-between the two shades of red. Above Inuyasha's dog began to bite back harder, putting as much pressure as its opponent. "YYYYAAAAAAA!" Inuyasha yelled. They were now ten feet into the ground and it was increasing. At this rate, they were going to fall through the island. Another foot was breached and golden water began to slowly fill the huge crater where the brothers struggled in the center.</p><p>They both as if ending the deadlock kicked each other away. Both brothers flipped backwards through the air, passing through the ghostly dogs. The dogs followed their respective brother. Inuasha landed outside the crater with one hand implanted into the ground. Sesshomaru was on one knee as both struggled to regain their breath from using that much energy. Sesshomaru reached up and touched the blood on his neck and smiled. His connection with his inner spirit was growing the more he fought with his brother and it seemed to be true for Inuyasha too. As both brothers took a moments respite, both demon dogs were growling at each other.</p><p>Inuyasha's face suddenly fell. "I can't win" Sesshomaru blinked, he never expected that. "I'm going to lose everything, my sword, my home and all to my brother." His frown grew as Inuyasha seemed to grow more depressed. "I'm nothing but an outcast, not human, not youkai." Sesshomaru danger senses told him that an energy was growing rapidly. "I won't be able to stop Naraku after all he's done to me...I won't be able to protect Kagome...Kagome'll die" A massive green aura grew around Inuyasha's body, radiating pure depression. Inuyasha raised his hands in the air. "PERFECT SHI SHI HOKUDAN!"</p><p>Sesshomaru's eyes widened as a massive pillar of energy grew out of Inuyasha's body. It was so bright, it became daylight briefly in the eternally nocturnal grounds of the Northern Lands. It was so big in the air that no matter where Sesshomaru moved, it was going to hit him so he crossed his arms and changed his floating guards into a glowing shield as the pillar of energy fell onto him. A geyser of golden water rose into the air as the pillar of energy forced in into the air as the earth shook. Sesshomaru winced as he shield was burned away and he was blocking purely with his forearms. He was being pushed by both the pillar of energy slamming into him and the barrier of the wall preventing him from moving back more.</p><p>The energy of the ball was used up and Sesshomaru fell to hius knees. The demon dog was also on the ground shaking its head to clear the dizziness. Inuyasha looked like death warmed over, but that was only his expression. His dog had a huge grinned as its attack worked. Sesshomaru climbed back to his knees and plunged the energy blade into the ground to help balance him as his knees stopped shaking. Inuyasha was breathing hard. "Damn it, I thought that would work. Who would have thought your hide was that tough," He muttered looking at the big burns on Sesshomaru's arms. They were healing as he spoke.</p><p>"That won't be enough to stop me. I never though you would use a depression based attack." He pulled his energy blade out of the ground and got into a stance. Inuyasha followed suit and the two rushed each other. They past each other after their swords deflected the other. Sesshomaru ran towards the barrier, did a front flip that landed his feet on the barrier and launched himself at his brother, his sword poised to decapitate his brother.</p><p>Inuyasha saw this in time and ducked only his hair didn't escape in time. Both watched as most of Inuyasha's hair fell to the ground in a heap. Inuyasha's hair was now to his neck and was very spiky. Inuyasha rubbed the back of his neck, after running his hand through his hair, causing it to become even spikier. "I've been meaning to cut it anyway." (A/N: Don't flame me for cutting off Inuyasha's hair! I mean it!) Inuyasha reached down and tucked the rest of his cut hair into his robes. He than cracked his neck and charged at his brother. Sesshomaru raised his sword to guard, but that was a faint from Inuyasha with a twist and a scream of pain from Sesshomaru Inuyasha landed facing away from his brother. He turned and gasped</p><p>Sesshomaru's right arm was on the ground. "I can't believe you cut off the same arm." Tenseiga pulsed as lightning arced from the stub to the decapitated limb. The limb twitched before flying through the air and reattaching to Sesshomaru's body. Smoke rose from the point from where his limb was attached to his body. There wasn't even a scar remaining from where Sesshomaru arm reattached. Sesshomaru flexed his arm and rotated it to get the blood flowing again. "Good thing, I learned a lot of new things. Oh Soul Heal, if you wanted to know. Spirit Berserker Light"</p><p>With that he charged Inuyasha and both brother's began exchanging blows with. With each clash of the blades a minor shockwave ran through the whole ring. They both locked blades over the massive crater again, but this time it was in mid air and the crater was now full of golden water. Inuyasha jumped out the water as soon as possible, but his brother didn't follow. While Inuyasha was in midair he watched amazed as the newly formed lake froze. It was a beautiful sight to behold as the golden water was now golden crystal ice. Then he heard his brother. "Soul Freeze" Stalagmites began raising out the frozen lake, shattering it and causing numerous scratches to form on Inuyasha, despite his fire rat robes and the fact he used the Tetsusaiga to block his face. Sesshomaru jumped out the reformed lake that had frozen mini-glaciers in it.</p><p>Sesshomaru was dry though. "Spirit Berserker Ice. You should have really learned the family art." Inuyasha frowned. He was starting to regret that too. He reached out and grabbed a rip in his sleeve and pulled down. His robe was magically enhanced to repair itself. He ripped a strip off and jerked it towards Sesshomaru. The cloth became razor thin as it flew through the air as a deadly projectile. Sesshomaru ducked, and Inuyasha faded away as he used another boost. Sesshomaru jerked as he was stabbed in the torso with the energy blade of Tetsusaiga. He kicked hard and dislodged Inuyasha's weapon from his chest, knocking him back. "Soul Heal" He muttered as he clasped a hand over his chest. Not only did his chest wound heal, so did the dragon scale armor, but he had to waste a lot of energy to heal himself again.</p><p>As Sesshomaru was healing Inuyasha swung his blade and preformed another Wind Scar technique. Fortunately, Sesshomaru healed iin time and slashed out his sword with a scream of "Soul's Fury!" Rather than canceling out, the attacks swerved around each other and struck the intended target. Both men were sent flying into the barrier so hard that once again it rippled. Sesshomaru got up first. His scale armor was mostly gone, but one could see it slowly growing back, but for the rest of the fight it was useless, so he just ripped it off to reveal his chest. He was bare from the waist up now. Sesshomaru grunted as he reset his dislocated shoulder. Besides that, he only had minor scratches and a black eye he was fine.</p><p>Inuyasha was no better. His fire rat robe was in tatters, but it could be used as armor still as it covered most of his body still. He also had a matching black eye and his nose was bleeding. Inuyasha reached up and fixed his broken nose back into the proper position with a wince. The energies around the brothers were dimmer now, as they had used up a big chunk of that energy.</p><p>Sesshomaru decided he wanted to end the fight right there, but that was when he made a mistake. "Soul Destroyer!" A massive wave of pure destruction came out, easily bigger then any seen before, but he saw his brother smirk and knew that he had made a mistake. Inuyasha smirked "Bakuriyaha!" (A/N I forgot how to spell Tetsusaiga's ultimate move) All at once the Soul Destroyer was turned around at ten times its strength. As the wave approached Sesshomaru, he made a last ditch effort and did a move before the blast consumed him. Inuyasha smirked as the attack hit dead on, and watched as dozens of tornados of youki formed around the area Sesshomaru was at, tearing everything asunder.</p><p>When it cleared, there was no sign of Sesshomaru what so ever, not even a blood stain. Inuyasha gulped, he didn't love his brother, but he didn't mean to kill him. "That was close" Sesshomaru's voice came from behind him, ending his worried thoughts. Sesshomaru was unharmed, but the reason Inuyasha was gaping was that their were four Sesshomaru's standing in front of him. "How? No one should have been able to escape."</p><p>All four Sesshomaru smirked. "Your move locks on to an aura, but what if one's aura suddenly split into four directions. No lock." All four got into a stance and Inuyasha smirked. "You can't trick me with Fox Sorcery, only one of you is real. I've seen Shippo do the same trick plenty of times." If anything all four Sesshomaru's smirked and all waved their hands. "Bring it then" Inuyasha complied and took a swipe at the one he figured to be his brother. He smirked when he locked blades. "See told you, I don't even have to worry about those other illusions now."</p><p>That was quickly disproved when he got slashed in the sides from to different directions and a massive cut ran up his back. Inuyasha hissed in pain and broke the sword lock he had with the Sesshomaru he saw. Standing in front of him, were four grinning Sesshomaru's, all in a different sword stance. "How? Fox sorcery can not do that!" One Sesshomaru grinned "That's" He then rushed forward to attack, Inuyasha blocked it though. "Because" Another Sesshomaru said as he glided through the air to launch a blow at Inuyasha's head. Inuyasha dodged the best he could and only got a cut on his cheek. "We're" The third Sesshomaru said running towards the barrier and using it to launch himself towards his brother. Inuyasha blocked it, but the force had sent him back several meters. "All" The last said summoning a ball of energy that was mixed between lightning and fire. Inuyasha rather than try and block, jumped high into the air. He was unprepared for all four Sesshomarus to follow him. "REAL" They said as they smashed into Inuyasha with the side of their four matching energy Tenseigas</p><p>Inuyasha was sent flying down towards the ground, but he was lucky as he landed into the lake that had formed during their fight, but just from the combined blows did a real number on his system. His arm was broken and parts of his legs were numb. As it was he was starting to have trouble staying conscious with the blows to his head and his rapidly declining air supply. His strength was running out and with that Inuyasha was desperate. He still wanted to fight. That was when he heard a howl.</p><p>He opened his eyes and saw floating in front of him was the dog that appeared when he first locked blades with his brother. The dog looked at him through glowing ruby eyes and nudged him. It looked Inuyasha straight in the eyes and something past between ruby and gold eyes and Inuyasha nodded and the dog jumped at him.</p><p>Meanwhile above the water, the four Sesshomaru's were on each side of the crator looking into the water. That was when the water began to boil as streams of white glowing mist began to raise out of the water. Following that was a massive shape. The first thing all four Sesshomaru's saw were a pair of glowing ruby eyes, before it slammed into all of them with a complex spin. Three of the Sesshomaru faded away and the last one was groaning on the ground. He glanced up and saw a massive shape in the air falling towards him. He rolled to his feet and jumped away, as the shaped slammed into the spot he was, in doing this he saw what his brother turned into.</p><p>Glaring at him was a massive dog, just as big as his own alternate mode. Only its fur was extremely spiky in every single direction. Inuyasha was growling at him and Sesshomaru noticed coming from his mouth was the similar glowing mist that signifies the most powerful energy of the Western Lands. The ruby eyes...Sesshomaru couldn't believe it, his brother had attained a state that he has been seeking to control himself. With ruby colored eyes, shows a connection with the inner beast. Not beserker with the color of blood in the eyes, but a controlled state.</p><p>Inuyasha didn't wait for Sesshomaru to finish his thoughts before he pounced at him. Inuyasha was much, much faster this way. Sesshomaru had to leap to the right to barely dog the charge, only to be snatched out of midair by Inuyasha who had followed in the air and bit into him. Without the dragon scale armor, Sesshomaru was much more vulnerable to Inuyasha's razor sharp fangs.</p><p>He howled in pain as Inuyasha increased the pressure. Sesshomaru growled as Tenseiga pulsed and grinned as he cut off his brothers foreleg. Inuyasha howled in pain as it got to its feet. "Now you know how I felt when you cut off my arm!" He yelled and charged at his brother, but he was caught off guard when the mist coming from his brother's mouth shifted to the newly made stump and a new leg was instantly formed. Inuyasha only smirked as it batted away his brother with his regrown paw.</p><p>Sesshomaru slammed into the ground not far off, but was hit hard enough to bounce off the ground several times. This time he couldn't get up without using Tenseiga as a crutch. He glared at Inuyasha who was still smirking at him. "You hear me brother, I'm not going to lose. No matter how strong you'll get, I'll always get stronger!" Sesshomaru's eyes changed from blood red to the glowing ruby that his brother had. The energy Tenseiga faded away as Sesshomaru began howling as loud as he could. The transparent dog floating over Sesshomaru came down and jumped into Sesshomaru himself.</p><p>The mist like energy grew and encased Sesshomaru's form, hiding him from sight. It began flaring in places and expanding rapidly. Throughout this, Sesshomaru's howl could be heard, growing deeper and more beast like. Then a figure emerged from the energy cacoon. It was Sesshomaru in his dog form, with brightly glowing ruby eyes. His fur wasn't spikey and wild like Inuyasha's but straight and well groomed. Sesshomaru howl was replaced by growling. Inuyasha joined him and the two charged at each other.</p><p>There was no blocking or dodging, just clawing and biting as the two massive dogs tore into each other. Both were tired, injured and wanted this fight over, but neither was willing to submit to the other. Even though the transformation brought a huge increase in the abilities of both, they achieved this form when at the bare minimum, so both were burning out fast. Inuyasha stumbled when Sesshomaru head butted him but returned with a vicious slash that stained Sesshomaru's middle red with blood. Sesshomaru howled and rushed forward and bit into Inuyasha's side, returning the favor with his teeth instead of claws.</p><p>Both, once again stood apart at each side of the ring. Both were limping as they lost to much energy to recover now. They had both past the point of no return. In the next few moments, was going to conclude the fight between the brothers. A breeze blew by, ruffling their fur. Using that as a signal, both jumped at each other. There were no clawing, biting, scratching, but rather, both just slammed into each other as hard as possible succeeding in throwing the other to the ground.</p><p>As they fell, they changed back to normal. The mist was gone, as their energy drained to the point that if they use any more, they run the risk of killing themselves. Both struggled as they got to their feet facing each other. Sesshomaru suddenly smiled widely at his brother. "It's been a good fight" Inuyasha nodded returning the smile. "Yes it has been." With that said, a bond was reestablished with the brothers.</p><p>That was when Inuyasha fell forward and passed out. The strain was just too much for him. Going into his alternate state unprepared and tired made him burn a little bit more energy then Sesshomaru. Sesshomaru smiled as the barrier went away and those watching began to approach them. Sesshomaru smiled and looked up into the sky, that was going back to nightime due to the islands magic forcing itself. "I've won" He said before his eyes rolled up into the back of his head and he fell backwards into the ground. Both unconscious brothers still had the wide, peaceful smiles on their faces. Also no one knew who it happened as Sonic had a tight grip on the swords, but both Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga were on the chest of their own masters</p><p>Read and Review</p><p>A/N: That took me a while, but I feel real good about this.
