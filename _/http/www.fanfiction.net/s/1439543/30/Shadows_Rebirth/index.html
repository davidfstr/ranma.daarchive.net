</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth</p><p>A/N: Thanks for reading. I don't mind about people using my ideas for stories just give me credit. Lighten up, I happened to like how people took my small idea. In truth had the coin turn tails, I would have never started Shadow's Rebirth.</p><p>Chapter 26: I start to drown underneath those depths.</p><p>Present Day: United Nations Building.</p><p>Every single representative of the U.N sat as they tried to absorb the news. First the U.S president is dead, then the Queen of England was killed; ironically impaled by their own flag. With the death of England's figurehead, the country was morally crippled. They have closed their borders and refuse to even show up for the meeting as the whole country is grieving her death. Now they just received the news the the heads of Africa, Italy, France and Germany were brutally killed. Like the last few deaths, their was no evidence besides the dead bodies and even then sometimes their wouldn't even be bodies.</p><p>The whole world was going to hell as there was an international search for the killers. Several famous killers have publicly calmed credit, only to end up dead within a couple of days. They were risking a meeting of the nations to try and pool together resources to locate these killers. Of course on the minds of a couple of countries, they wanted to hire them themselves. The silence was broken when a messenger came in, obviously out of breath.</p><p>The head of the meeting took the message and gasped. "We have more confirmed deaths. Heads of Mexico, Canada, China, and Russia was just reported dead..." He paused when he read. "I can't believe it. The emperor of Japan had prevented them from killing him." The whole place went up in an uproar. Instantly people tried to blame Japan for the strain of deaths when the ambassador of a Thailand stood up. "Tell us, how did the emperor succeed in protecting his life when no one else did?"</p><p>The head nodded as he read more of the report. "According to this. A couple of mouths ago the Emperor received a package from the newly emerged Mobian Corp. Inside was a steel belt designed like a dragon, a set of emperors robes made out of what appeared to be silk and an gift note from the head of Mobian Corp, Ranma Saotome. Today the Emperor was wearing these clothes to a private gathering when one of the assassins tried to attack him when he was alone. According to the report, a FORCE FIELD came out the belt and forced away each and every of the attacks. The attacker retreated after seeing the emperor escape."</p><p>There was silence after that. Every country has heard of Mobian Corp. but didn't think too much of their technology besides the desire to be the first to get it. "We have a description of the assassin." He pointed to a huge monitor behind him and on it was a hazy picture of White Cloud. "He's just a boy! How could he do all this?" One of the representatives yelled. "We don't know, but we shall put his face on international news. For now, we are trying to locate the members of Mobian Corp to request what they gave the Emperor of Japan, but to no success, it seems that they dropped of the face of the earth."</p><p>Another ambassador stood up. "Why don't we just raid their headquarters and take what we want!" The head sighed "We have no idea where their headquarters are to be honest. We tried to go to that temple that was explored on the events recently seen on t.v, but the temple is gone and the area surrounding it has been blocked off by another force field. We have all reasons to believe that this is their headquarters or something very big has been hidden there. Until then we can't do anything but wait till Mobian Corp. resurfaces from wherever they hidden themselves" There was a gradual agreement as there was nothing they could do.</p><p>"So next we release the image for the killers and hunt him down." Before anyone could respond. "I can't let that happen" The whole room looked up where they found two people standing on the ceiling. One was White Cloud and the other Black Wind. Despite standing upside down, their clothing and hair defied gravity by not falling down. "You all must die for the glory of the empire" Both said at the same time, White Cloud was pointing his sword, while Black Wind was pointing his gun that transformed from the golden cyclinder on his hand.</p><p>Before anyone could react, a white fog filled the room and in it were swirls of black smoke. There were screams and gurgling as red flashes appeared in the fog. At one point the doors opened but were quickly sealed closed. In the fog joining the sounds of death were thunderous roars as if hell itself has opened up to let lose its fury among mankind. As soon as the fog appeared it was gone and in its place were the withering corpses of the members of the U.N. White Cloud and Black Wind were standing at the same spot they first appeared in. Slowly, out of the dead bodies, black and white colored souls were forced out and rose into the ceiling before they were sucked inside the bodies of the killers. Both smirked and melted into the ceiling and were gone just like that.</p><p>Usagi stared at the stars out the balcony of the inn her, Amy, Lara and Shadow were staying at. Before they rejoined the others the girls decided to 'show' Shadow how much they missed him. She blushed quickly at some of the activities they done. They didn't have sex, but it was pretty darn close to it. Funny enough, it was Shadow who tired all three women out before he decided to join them into sleep, but something woke her up.</p><p>She couldn't get back to sleep, so she went to the balcony wrapped in one of the extra blankets so she can watch the sky. It was a full moon outside and one could see outside as if it was daytime. "You okay Usagi?" She turned and saw Shadow behind her, He was just dressed in a pair of slacks, leaving his bare musclear chest for the world to see. It turned out when Shadow didn't hide his TaiYoukai markings, they went all over his body. Down his neck, to his shoulders, along the sides of his torso and down his arms were red slash marks similar to the ones on his jaw and on the back of his hands were black crescent moons. They only enhanced his looks, she could even swear that they were glowing in the moonlight. She blushed as she got several naughty thoughts, but put them out her mind.</p><p>"I'm okay, just thinking" She shivered and Shadow saw this. He walked up and wrapped his arms around her; his hands lightly resting on her stomach and putting her back in contact with his front. She smiled at the increased warmth. "Thanks, next time I should wear something underneath this blanket." Shadow blushed slightly and grinned some. He pulled up a nearby chair with one of his feet and sat on it so Usagi was sitting in his lap as the two stared at the full moon in a comfortable silence.</p><p>Shadow broke it eventually. "Do you know the people of the Northern Lands, worship the Moon. They are nocturnal and like to hide in shadows, and from the sun, but the moon gives them hope and with that hope, power. Usagi looked down at his hands and brushed her fingertips over his markings. They were warmer then his flesh and it she was right, they were glowing in synch with the moon. "That's is very nice, Shadow" She said, liking the feeling of his hands reaching into the blanket and stroking her stomach with his clawed fingertips.</p><p>"That isn't why you're here though, to tell me about the people of the Northern Lands." Usagi said as she placed her hands over his. Shadow chuckled. "Busted, Okay, I'll ask. Why did you fall for me? I would have thought you would have been mad at me for...well killing you. Its been a record for it to bite me in the ass when I try to help people." She turned her face from the moon to him, so he could see some of her face. On her forehead glowing brightly was a golden crescent moon.</p><p>She leaned towards him and put her forehead to his so that both their markings were touching slightly in the middle as his was a vertically shaped marking. "I feel this strength come from you to me whenever you were around, ever sense I first met you in Rei's temple. There was something about you that affects me all the way down to my soul. When I see you I just want to melt and when you touch me, even briefly, I suffer a little death" She shuddered when he reached up so that his hand was resting below her breast. Her face fell slightly. "I never felt this for Mamoru. There was affection, but it wasn't anything serious. At times it sickened me as I felt I was kissing a sibling or something." Shadow tightened his hug slightly and Usagi shuddered as she snuggled into him.</p><p>"Just like that, when I'm around you, I feel everything can get better and so far I've been right. It's not just you, but Amy too. She makes me so happy and I just want to protect her while Lara is so strong, so cultered, so passionate. I can't explain it much more then that, because I'm still discovering so much more I love about all of you." She squeezed his hand and brought it up so it could rest on her heart. "Don't you feel it, my heart, it beats so strongly for all of you." She leaned towards him more so she could kiss him, by now she had turn enough so that she was halfway facing him.</p><p>He let go of the kiss and she shuddered in pleasure again as she rested partially on his chest. At this point Shadow was rubbing her side lightly with his hand causing small moans to rise out of Usagi. "Oh wow" She muttered as her face was now completely red. Shadow smirked. "You haven't seen anything yet" And he kissed her again. This wasn't a peck as they've been lip locking, nor was it just lips to lips. This was an all out lip smacking, tongue dueling, sweat making kiss that made Usagi's legs twitch as they turned into liquid.</p><p>Shadow leaned back to recover his breath as he watched Usagi stare at him with a glazed expression and even had a hint of drool escaping her mouth. When she finally did recover, the first thing she said was. "You sure know how to roll your R's" Shadow laughed as Usagi smirked at him with a lusty expression. "Now let me show you how I dot my Q's" He said as he leaned back in. Usagi giggled as the two resumed their activities underneath the moonlight. Neither one notice when a red crescent moon appeared under Usagi's golden one and neither one could see when similar markings appeared on the sleeping forms of Lara and Amy.</p><p>Nodoka sighed in relief as her back was massaged, next to her, sighing in relief was Kimiko and Gerald. The only difference was while the women's masseuse was hunky males, Gerald's was a gorgeous female. The fact that all of them had cat ears and tails didn't take away from the looks at all. "I love my son" Nodoka moaned as they found a certain spot that was always increase when her ex-husband would do something stupid.</p><p>"OHHHH GOOODDD!" They just found the stress taken from Soun on Kimiko's back. Gerald was silent but occasionally grunted. "I love your son too" Kimiko said as she melted into the table. Gerald nodded when he saw something out of the corners of his eye. "Nodoka?" She turned her head towards him, her body being to relaxed to do anything else. "Yes" Gerald pointed to her chao partner that had recently hatched. "I was wondering why does your chao have ten wings?"</p><p>Her partner, Eidolon was solid black, in fact the area it hung around made everything darker as it was causing the nearby light to warp around it. It's head was spiked like Shade's but attached to its back were ten ebony wings that glowed. It didn't resemble a newly formed chao, but it was the next stage like Shade, it was just as tall as a five year old and also like Shade had a slightly transparent appearance. Floating over its head was a black halo. Eidolon had an mischievous smirk on it as it looked at Gerald. Nodoka smiled lovingly at her partner. "Now that's a secret dear."</p><p>Gerald rolled his eyes. "Could you trigger its alternate form then? I'm really curious as to what it'll turn into. I know that you can" Nodoka shrugged and snapped her fingers. The ten wings on Eidolon pulsed as they wrapped around the chao. They changed to where they appeared to be made out of pure ebony energy rather then glowing feathers. The wings sprung free to revel Eidolon's new form. All of it was glowing pure energy as it was now a being of pure energy that resembled a beautiful ebony hawk, only it had ten wings.</p><p>"Wow" Both Kimiko and Gerald said as they stared. Even the masseuses stopped to stare at the beauty before him. Gerald then remembered that a chao reflect his partners soul and with that all the blood rushed to his face as he could only imagine what he's missing from Nodoka. He knew that she was special but he never expected something like this. Nodoka tapped the masseuse. "Can you continue?" He nodded as started his work again. "That's better." The other two just watched her and turned to her chao that was now resting on a nearby chair in its alternate state. "Sometimes, Someday, My dream shall becomes real and I shall have to awake to embrace the darkness that exist within my soul." Gerald and Kimiko turned to listen to the semi-aware Nodoka. "For when my soul is awake, so shall my power. Please tell my son this when you think its the right time, for if you don't you shall set him on a path that will cause the destruction of all and he will succeed in sending all to oblivion." She turned away so that neither could see when one of her eyes flashed. The outside of her pupils turned red while the core of her eyes turned solid black.</p><p>Kikyo sat with her head lowered, still having the faintest trace of a blush on her face. She couldn't believe how much she overreacted when she felt her heart started beating again. She just up and jumped on Inuyasha's brother. She glanced up and found that he was staring at her, he too had a slight blush to his face, only his was barely seen. She flushed deeper just by glancing at his handsome features.</p><p>She tried to listen to the conversation between Mousse and the one they called Sonic. "So where are you headed again?" Mousse asked. Sonic grinned "I'm escorting Sesshomaru to the Northern Lands. As I am traveling him I decided to act as a bodyguard, even though he doesn't need one, it'll get me inside the Northern Lands." Sesshomaru nodded in agreement, even though he was still staring at Kikyo for some reason. Both the Senshi saw this and nodded to themselves. "So why are you headed for the Northern Lands?"</p><p>Sonic turned to them confused. "You mean you haven't heard?" He got shakes of the head at that. "Shadow is the Lord of the Northern Lands and by what Sesshomaru tells me, sense someone claimed the title of NekoTachi, the four lords of the great Heavenly Empires of the Four Directions are going to meet to discuss the future of their empires." He got funny looks from Mousse and the Senshi as they never expected him to be informed on what's going on, but Sonic ignored this.</p><p>Kikyo felt stable enough not to shutter so she turned to Sonic. "What was that move? I never felt such power, the only thing I think could match it was Inuyasha's Wind Scar move." Sonic grinned as he pulled out his katana and the moment he did, his hair took a shiny metallic tint to it. "My blade that I made myself, the Sonic Striker" He held up his hand and floating above it was a representation of the earth. "Now everything has a connection to the chaos energy that is everywhere." Glowing lines began to intersect his picture that went beyond the planet. "There are some that can see these natural lines and can tap into it. With my blade, I can unleash the chaos energy stored in these 'leylines' to do what I want, it this case an offensive weapon."</p><p>Everyone stared wide-eyed at him. "What, just because I act like it, doesn't mean I'm an idiot. Why I need a profound knowledge of Physics to keep myself from killing myself when I run so freaking fast!" He rolled his eyes and chuckled at their dumbfounded expressions. He pounded his chest in pride. "Yeah, I'm all that" Mousse rolled his eyes, with Sesshomaru as Kikyo stared at him like he was stupid and the senshi giggled.</p><p>Sonic turned to Mousse. "So what have you been doing" Mousse shrugged. "Nothing much, traveling, killing demons, escaping a nightmarish castle of Naraku." Sesshomaru cut him off. "Wait? You've been at Naraku's castle?" Mousse nodded and pointed behind him. "Yeah, its about three days away in that direction." Sesshomaru got an evil grin on his face and turned to Sonic. "Can I ask you a favor?"</p><p>Several moments later Sesshomaru and Sonic appeared at Naraku's castle. "So what do you want me to do?" Sonic asked. "I want you to perform a Sonic Striker after I do something" Sesshomaru pulled out the Tenseiga, which promptly manifested the armored ghostly aura which turned pitch black. Along with the aura shifting, Sesshomaru's eyes and markings glowed black as well.</p><p>"Soul Erase" Sesshomaru muttered as he slashed down towards the massive castle. A wave of black energy went out his blade and in a similar move to the Wind Scar his brother uses, hit the castle. When the wave cleared, there were claw marks on the ground in front of Sesshomaru, but the castle looked untouched. Sonic was about to say something, when Sesshomaru held up three fingers. "Three, Two, One, Zero" At zero he snapped his fingers and a massive changed happened.</p><p>Before his and Sonic's very eyes the castle just rotted away as if it aged a million years suddenly. Soon there was nothing but chunks of wood, stone and ash. Sesshomaru gracefully put his blade away and turned to Sonic, "If you will" Sonic shrugged and his hair glowed with his drawn blade as he slammed the tip into the ground. "Sonic Striker!" He yelled as a massive blue wave consumed what was left of Naraku's castle. When his own attack was done, there was nothing but smooth dirt. There was nothing to ever suggest that Naraku's castle was there.</p><p>Sesshomaru nodded. "I wanted nothing to remain." Sonic chuckled as he prepared a return trip. "You are spiteful man...but that's why I like you" Sesshomaru responded by doing something out of character, he chuckled merrily after scratching something into a nearby rock.</p><p>Naraku groaned when he finally got to the area where his castle was. All he wanted to do was kill someone for that humiliating defeat. He groaned to himself as he remembered how he lost Kanna, even worse, Onigumo is free again. He still doesn't know how that is going to effect him besides the massive power lost he suffered. Even worse was that thought that he may never recover that level. He sighed as he got over the last hill that blocked his castle from the view of others.</p><p>That sigh died a painful death when he saw nothing there. "Where's my castle?" He said out loud. He got his answer when on a rock next to him was scratched in. "Sesshomaru was here" He read out loud dumbly. Then a rage over took him and his furs burned into ashes as his aura flared. "THAT IS IT! I'M GOING TO KILL ALL OF YOU!" It quickly degenerated into loud curses.</p><p>Sesshomaru paused in his speaking and the group looked at him. He put a hand to his ear. "Do you hear that?" He asked. When he got shakes of the head, he continued. "That's the sweet sound of vengeance." He grinned and continued telling the others of the history of the Western Lands.</p><p>Big stared at the ceiling of the shrine he and the Senshi were staying at. He couldn't sleep as he didn't get all the fishing that he could done. His thoughts on catching that perfect fish was interrupted when someone knocked on his door. "Come in" It opened to reveal the form of Kanna. She was dressed in a large white shirt that went to her knees. In her hands was a huge stuffed bear given to her by the Senshi rather then her precious mirror.</p><p>"What do you need Kanna?" Big asked as he sat up to look at her. She was trembling and she had a doe like expression on her face. "I'm scared, can I stay with you?" She said, clearing showing the emotion Inuyasha and his group never seen. Big looked at her for awhile before pulling the blankets aside. Kanna gave him a wide smile as she joined him. Soon she was dozing off peacefully but before she did. "Are you going to be my daddy?"</p><p>Big looked at her sleepy but hopeful expression and nodded. "Yes," He patted her hand. "Go to sleep, daughter. Daddy's here" Kanna gave him another wide smile before finally falling asleep. Big smiled at her also before he himself also went to sleep. The door opened briefly and the two senshi retreated into their rooms.</p><p>Minako was the first to comment. "That was...really nice of him" Makoto nodded. "Big is a big softy." Minako nodded but giggled. "Are you kidding? I bumped into him later and all that mass is solid muscle, no soft spots anywhere." Makoto smirked slightly when she saw the faintest blush on her friends face. "Aw, Mina-chan, are you falling for Big?" Minako's flush increased slightly and she glared at her friend. "What I saw you staring at his butt, Mako-chan!"</p><p>Now it was Makoto's turn to blush as she choked out denials. "He's not fat, but built like a bear. All the cute guys are always taken or evil. Big is rugged." She said then blushed when she realized that she just called him rugged. Minako giggled, "Rugged, eh? Mako-chan is thinking perverted thoughts about Big? Maybe you want to use his rod" She said and giggled as her friend turned crimson. Makoto grabbed a pillow and hit her friend in the head starting a massive pillow fight.</p><p>Down the hallway in another room, there was another figure awake. Onigumo stared at the ceiling, actually he was staring at his unburned hands. He was still dressed in his bandit armour and was just resting on his futon. The last time he saw them were as he offered his soul to all those youkai. Getting burned alive must have driven him insane or something because he no longer feels that dark lust for the miko Kikyo.</p><p>"Its weird. I've been offered another chance. What should I do. Go back to being nothing but a simple bandit?" He said outloud to himself. "While I was trapped in Naraku I saw something great. Could I ever become like what I saw. Can I crawl out the corruption and become a better person. For the first time, I have friends, even though they are weird, but not like those lackeys I had."</p><p>He then realized what happened. When he escaped Naraku, he left all his evil feelings and negative emotions in Naraku while he took a good portion of his power. Onigumo laughed, feeling like he did in his youth when he was just an adventurer rather then become a bandit. As far as he was concerned, if he never saw Naraku again, he would die a happy man.</p><p>"Get up and do it again" Said her new teacher. Akane growled at him as she got off the floor. She was in yellow shorts and sleeveless shirt; in her hand was a short dagger. She was standing in front of a massive tree, a redwood most likely. The tree itself had a lot of slash marks going partly the way up. Akane glared at the werewolf again before clenching the dagger and running straight at the tree as if she wanted to knock it over. That didn't happen though, instead Akane started to run up the tree, right where the markings were. She got all the up to the point the markings ended and a little past that before she fell to the ground in a heap.</p><p>"Get up and do it again" Her sensei said as he watched her from another tree. He had changed his clothing to where a cloak covered his features. Akane glared at him. "I can't believe you're making me do something like this. I bet you can't even go as far as I can!" Her teacher snorted and jumped off the tree he was standing on. He walked past her and towards the tree, not even sprinting. He, with a causal grace began to walk up the tree and easily reached the top before turning around and walked back down. He walked past Akane and back to the tree he was watching her.</p><p>He chuckled at her dumbfounded expression, complete with her jaw six feet into the ground. "Get up and do it again" Akane gathered herself again and began running back up the tree again, failing yet again, but this time she just got back up and did it again. A figure jumped into the tree next to her sensei. "Why are you helping her?" The person shrugged. "I had to do something while I was waiting for you Rouge, so I figured I'll reeducate her on the meaning of true strength"</p><p>Rouge smiled. She was wearing the same outfit she was when Tails and Hotaru found her in another part of the forest. "Now how did you know it was me?" She asked trailing a finger on his chest. Akane's Sensei tapped his nose. "I know your scent, very, very, very well." She blushed slightly as she trailed her hand over his reddish brown fur. "Oh turn back already. I may not have any problems kissing snout, I rather have a nice pair of lips, Knuckles."</p><p>Knuckles chuckles as his body shifted. Where there was once a nine foot werewolf, was now a six footed Knuckles. "I've been waiting Rouge." He said huskily as he drew her into a very deep kiss. She melted against him when he let go. The only sounds were their breathing...oh and Akane falling on her ass yet again. Rouge giggled when she saw this. "When do you think she'll realize that she has to use her energy to ground herself into the tree"</p><p>Knuckles shrugged. "I guess ten more days." Rouge nodded as she leaned against him. "Hey, how come you've been here in this forest instead of collecting the shards of the Chaos Emerald?" Knuckles smirked. "Why should I go after the emerald. I already have one. Remember? The Master Emerald. I still remember where I hid it before the 'incident' where I lost you" Rouge's eyes widened as he pulled her into a deeper kiss. "I'll make sure that'll never happen again. She looked up at him with unshed tears. "Knuckles." He shook his head. "Shhh. Just kiss me" And she did so. Akane muttered another curse as she fell again.</p><p>"Inuyasha-sama!" Inuyasha blinked as Myoga, the flea Youkai jumped on his shoulder and was jumping up and down in a panic. "What do you want?" He asked and sighed as he crushed the old youkai when he attempted to suck some blood. The camping grounds went silent at this because Myoga often brought important news. "Inuyasha-sama, what are you doing here?"</p><p>Inuyasha blinked in confusion as did the others "What do you mean?" The flea youkai grunted in exasperation. "What are you doing here instead of the Northern Lands! As we speak, your brother is heading up there to meet with the lords of the north, south and east lands. If he arrives before you do, the title of Western Lord is as good as his!" He sighed again at the blank looks he was getting. That was when Ryouga decided to ask a question. "What does that mean if Sesshomaru claims the title of Western Lord?"</p><p>The flea youkai paused, trying to put this at simple as possible. "If Sesshomaru becomes Western Lord, every Youkai that lives in the Western Lands are under his control as everything would belong to him." Inuyasha blinked and shrugged. "So what, why does that involve me, let Fluffy have his title." Myoga wished he was bigger so he could pop Inuyasha. "Inuyasha-sama, When I say everything belongs to Sesshomaru, that means the Tetsusaiga as well. You would be forced to give it up to him if he ask or risk being hunted by every single Youkai in the Western Lands. I know you are a good fighter Inuyasha-sama, but I doubt you can go against about a million demons and live.</p><p>Kagome decided to add the bad news. "And the Northern Lord already took Tetsusaiga" Myoga's eyes widened and he fainted. "Most likely he'll give it to the Western Lord." Inuyasha stood up in a hurry "COME ON WE HAVE TO GO!" With his pressuring, the group was quickly packed and was running to the north. None of them realized they left Myoga passed out on the ground.</p><p>Several days later, Vash walked ahead in silence. He wasn't smiling, nor frowning, in fact he looked rather serious with his yellow sunglasses on. In the back was Alucard and in the middle were the Senshi and Tails. Tails had his weapon hanging from his shoulder, just in case, but otherwise he was too busy whispering with Hotaru. Occasionally one would blush to give a hint of what they were talking about, so that left Setsuna, Michiru and Haruka to talk amongst themselves.</p><p>"So Setsuna, how are things going with lover boy?" Haruka asked jerking a finger at Vash's back." She expected to see her friend blush as the two have been pretty serious, but she was unprepared to see Setsuna shudder and then frown. "I kinda messed things up" Michiru and Haruka both blinked at this. "What?" Setsuna looked at Vash briefly. "He's missing an arm and has horrendous scars all over his body. I got scared and failed to respond in time. There is so much about him I don't know about. I didn't even know his real name up to a couple of days ago."</p><p>Vash stopped briefly and turned around, showing that he had heard her even from so far ahead of them. His sunglasses flared and concealed his eyes, and he continued on his path again. Haruka wasted no time in popping her friend in the back of her head. "Don't fuck this up, Ms. I've been alone for thousands of years. Don't even think of turning to me and Michiru when the loneliness finally drives you to become a lesbian." Vash promptly tripped over a root and did a face dive, spewing blood from his nose the whole time. Tails and Hotaru looked at her and both flushed and sped up some. Alucard just looked away and started whistling as his smirk got bigger.</p><p>It took Michiru coughing for Haruka to realize what she just blurted out and she promptly when beet red, oddly matching Setsuna who was looking into the sky. Vash recovered and turned back to address everyone. "Guys and gals, we are officially in the Northern Lands. We'll head straight for Shadow's palace in the sky" With that Vash pointed up into the sky and everyone but Alucard gasped, but even the vampire was impressed.</p><p>They saw something that amazed them. Floating above them were hundreds of islands suspended into the air. All of them had modern looking cities and massive forest covering the islands. Also many of said islands had lakes that were filled full of golden water in where waterfalls ran from one island to another and another until they saw the water disappear into the horizon. "Its so beautiful. Its like something you'll find in a painting" Hotaru said as Tails took out a camera and began to take pictures.</p><p>The others were just as affected. Setsuna in all her years of guarding the time gates, has never seen anything like this. How could she have missed something so magnificent. Haruka was imagining what it'll be like to see the Northern lands from over head while Michiru had a fantasy of swimming in those golden waters.</p><p>"Guys look over there" Vash said pointing to a portion of the sky. They did so and found two fast moving objects. Tails took out some binoculars and gasped. "I see two clouds moving towards the central island. One black and the other golden." He increased the magnification and smirked. "Its Shadow and he's with Amy, Usagi and Lara! I think he has a little girl with him and...a monkey?" Vash grinned. "Then we should catch up."</p><p>Vash reached into his pocket and withdrew a scroll. "Now stand back everyone, this is used to summon a guide directly to the palace." They did so and Vash threw the scroll into the air. It stopped in midair and unrolled it self a massive burst of wind surrounded the scroll. The wind was so massive, it pushed everyone but Vash and Alucard back. As it was Vash's jacket was moved slightly but Alucard's clothing wasn't affected by the wind at all.</p><p>When it cleared, the scroll was gone and in its place where there guides. Standing in front of them were massive tigers, sabertooths to be accurate. Each one was dark as night and all had glowing red eyes. The first one stalked up to Vash. "You are the Lord's party, get on our backs and we Wind Sabers shall transport you to the palace." It said in a beastial voice. Following the leaders voice all bowed down and waited for the riders to get one. "Is everyone secured" The leader said as Vash got on last. Everyone nodded. "Then we go!"</p><p>A barrier of wind surrounded each Wind Saber and they all jumped into the air, where they promptly began to run as if they were on the ground in the air and they were very fast. The world blurred slightly as they speed through the air towards the central floating island. As they got closer they saw the most elegant palace they ever saw. Even for the Senshi who had memories of the Silver Millennium, this put that to same. The palace was made out of a crystal that glowed brightly in the sun, where many figures and statues were curved into the very walls. There were dozens of fountains arranged so that the golden waters that came out of them trailed down the walls and embraced some of the wall designs.</p><p>Once they landed on the island, it suddenly became nighttime as the sun became the moon and the palace when from beautiful, to magical. Everything was glowing even brighter in the sudden moonlight, and at times, changing colors. The head Wind Saber noticed their surprise. "Its the magic of the Northern Lands. Its people prefer nighttime, so on each island there is a spell to make it eternally nighttime with the Moon always full." The Wind Sabers landed in front of the palace, where it turned out a bunch of their friends were waiting. Something was going on.</p><p>There was Big, Sonic, Knuckles, Rouge, Akane, Mousse, Ryouga, Chaos and all the Senshi but Usagi. Shadow, Amy, Lara and Usagi were missing. There where also people they never met before standing with them. Especially the little girl on Big's shoulder and the other young one hiding behind one of the people with white hair. Tails walked up to Sonic, who looked in his opinion, totally badass in the warlord armor, with two sheathed swords leaning against his shoulders.</p><p>Sonic turned and grinned. "Ah Tails, you finally made it. Well my new friend Sesshomaru was just challenged by his little brother for the title of the Western Lord. It's a straight hand to hand fight with the prize being the title of Western Lord and the two most powerful weapons in the Western Lands." He gestured to the two swords he was holding. "The Tetsusaiga and the Tenseiga. Shadow went in to change to a formal clothing so he could judge the match as bring out the Southern and Eastern lords so they can bear witness to the title being claimed."</p><p>At that point Shadow came out with two other people. Shadow himself was dressed in formal robes, made of a glowing black and red material which made him look divine somewhat. His robes had the picture of a massive feline wrapping around his body and at times it moved along the robes in a different position His hair was unbounded and it reached to the small of his back in waves of ebony streaked with red. His markings were glowing along side with his clothing...in fact they were glowing through the clothing. In a glowing sash was a sheathed Shade's Wrath. At his arrival, everyone went silent, not just because of the imposing image he presented but also the fact that the Eastern and Southern Lords were with him.</p><p>The Southern Lord was a woman. She was in a kimono that glowed like Shadow's but instead pulsing like moon light, it glowed like the embers in a fire as well as changing a multitude of colors. On it was the picture of a phoenix raising out a pyre. It didn't change position, no instead it flapped its wings or changed color. Her hair was composed of all different colors and looked as if they were made of flames themselves. Coming out her back where twelve fiery wings, each a different color. Where Shadow had slash marks on his cheeks and a crescent moon on his head, she had two vertical lines going up her cheeks and stopping before her eyes and on her forehead was a blazing sun. Her eyes were a gray...no a pure silver that stared at you with serenity with an underlying sense of power. Sonic and many of the males gulped at seeing her beauty. Shadow grinned at their reactions. "May I present, Lady Aurora, Lady of the Southern Lands. Mother Phoenix." He said, going by name, land ruled and title</p><p>Rei and Chaos both got to her knees and bowed. They recognized their sacred fires, in her. Aurora giggled slightly. "Oh don't do that. I'm just glad you use my fires for helping people." They got up and chuckled sheepishly. Aurora turned and saw Sonic and she flushed slightly, only Shadow caught that and chuckled. She gracefully walked up to Sonic. "And who are you?" Sonic spoke, squeaked actually. "Sonic, My Lady. I'm an ally of one of the heirs to the Western Lands." He said recovering slightly and taking her hand to kiss in a gentlemanly manner. "Pleased to make your acquaintance, My Lady" She giggled. "Oh the pleasure is all mine. You are a interesting one, 'Sonic' " She said his name as if she was tasting his name in her mouth. Sonic flushed deeper when he thought this and looked at her plush lips.</p><p>The Eastern Lord was a huge man that was about six and the half feet tall with a very powerful build not hidden by is robes. He was a black man wearing black and gray robes. They glowed and shimmered as if the light was reflecting off of water. On it was an imposing black dragon that was staring at those who was looking at it with its many eyes. On the man's shoulders where armor plating that had horns coming out. His hair was in a buzz cut which made you focus more on his reptilian eyes that screamed power. He would have looked human, had he not had massive horns growing out his head that were slopped back and two massive leathery wings. He didn't have markings but rather black gem like scales along the sides of his neck, jaw and back of his hands and on his head was a diamond. "Also, I present Lord Dracon, Lord of the Eastern Lands. King Bahamut."</p><p>He also made many of the unattached girls flush also as the scales and wings only enhanced his handsomeness. He nodded to show his greeting. "So these are InuTaisho's sons." Sesshomaru and Inuyasha jerked at hearing their father's name. Shadow nodded. "So we are here to observe who shall get the title of Western Lord in a hand to hand fight until one submits the other or gives up." As he spoke the ground underneath Inuyasha and Sesshomaru glowed. "There shall be no interruptions as this is a duel of honor" He said staring at the flustered Kagome. A glowing clear barrier formed around the area Inuyasha and Sesshomaru were standing, forming a ring of sorts and to protect the spectators. Inuyasha's Youkai markings appeared, not as elegant as he was Hanyou, but he didn't go berserk, many that knew Inuyasha noticed. After that happened, the TaiYoukai markings of both brothers began to glow, releasing a glowing mist from the markings and their breaths. Shadow, Aurora and Dracon all raised their hands in synch. "READY! FIGHT!"</p><p>They yelled as they brought their hands down and the fight was on.</p><p>Read and Review</p><p>VERY IMPORTANT! READ BELOW</p><p>Its time for you, the reader to vote, who shall win the title of Western Lord</p><p>Is It going to be:</p><p>Sesshomaru?</p><p>or</p><p>Inuyasha?</p><p>It is your descision</p><p>Later</p>
