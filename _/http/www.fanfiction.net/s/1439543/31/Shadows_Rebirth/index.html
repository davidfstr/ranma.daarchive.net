</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth</p><p>A/N: This isn't the battle between Sesshomaru and Inuyasha. Rather, I'm doing two mini side stories. Up first will involve Shadow when he first arrived in the past and the second part will involve the present with Kasumi and Keitaro with their budding romance.</p><p>Side Story 2:( Inuyasha) Times and changes.</p><p>Ranma groaned as he crawled out the crater. He looked to his side and found to his surprise a massive wing. He looked to his other side and there it was, a matching wing. Clutched in his hand was the Chaos Emerald, Shrunken to fit his hand, but because it was compact it glowed just as bright as any star, only the light didn't burn him. He looked up to find himself in the middle of a forest and right in front of him was a massive lake. 'Where am I?' He thought as he got to his feet. As he did so, many bones cracked as he stretched his body. He looked around and found nothing but trees around him. The air was fresh, not like the city but more like the woods he and Genma would travel through during the training trip</p><p>He began walking to the lake still clutching the Chaos Emerald, his body refused to release it from his hand. Occasional arcs of black lightning ran along his body. Ranma finally got to the lake and looked down to see his reflection. His hair was blood red with black streaks in it and his eyes were nothing but glowing pools of glowing black energy. He tested his muscles and he suddenly found himself in the air looked down at the lake. Flight was frighteningly easy. With his specialty aerial movements he quickly learned to control himself in the air with the aid of several mid-air Katas.</p><p>He landed on the ground and finally noticed the Chaos Emerald. When he looked at it, he remembered what happened. He dropped to his knees and began weeping. He had killed, again. Even worse that he only feels bad, because he doesn't feel bad about it. They had killed Amy, Maria and several of his friends, including the new one he found in Lara. He pounded his free hand into the ground and watched in awe as he made a massive chasm that swallowed up a row of trees. He looked at his hand in slight horror. "What is happening..." He paused when he glanced at the Chaos Emerald and he realized he was directly connected to it now. It was fueling him with a massive amount of energy and had changed his body so it could withstand it.</p><p>Then he remembered what happened after he killed Usagi. 'Hyper Chaos Control. It brought everyone back. Even the senshi were freed of what controlled them.' That thought increase the tears, only this time in joy. They were brought back. Maria wasn't dead, even better, Amy was alive. He looked around in confusion 'But where am I? Hyper Chaos Control sent me somewhere' He sat down in the lotus position and rested his head on his free hand. 'First, I need to do something about the Chaos Emerald'</p><p>He went into a meditative stance as he tried to absorb the Chaos Emerald the same way he does for his Guardian Emerald. He paused as he realized it was missing. Most likely Shade has it, but he could no longer feel Shade anymore. Anyways, he need to get back to concealing his Chaos Emerald, before something pinpointed on the energy it was giving off and decided that they wanted it for themselves. He grunted as the massive energy source flooded his whole body as he mind was almost overwhelmed by the pure source of chaos in his hands.</p><p>On some levels he realized that he was indeed holding a fragment of the universe in his hands, as chaos made everything and the Chaos Emeralds were fragments of Chaos itself given form. It lasted forever, but it was over just like that. For one brief moment, Ranma "Shadow" Saotome became one with the universe and it forever changed him on many levels and will continue to do so on many levels. He looked at his hands as his veins were pulsing, it looked kind of cool as all of them were glowing giving his body a look as if he was covered with glowing webs.</p><p>He saw, but at the same time didn't see as his wings glowed red and black then broke apart into shards of energy that floated into the air briefly before the energy shards were absorbed into his body. He felt the energy threaten to consume his body, but wasn't as the massive chaos energy introduced into his body was adapting his body to be able to handle it. Ranma kept on concentrating as he needed to contain this energy as it was bleeding off into his surroundings. The water of the lake into him glowed before it turned into a lake of pure glowing silver and the trees around him grew even taller and changed colors before turning to solid crystal. The ground followed the trees into turning into the crystal.</p><p>Because of the changes, the sunlight began casting rainbows all over the now crystal forest. As for Ranma, he was sweating as he struggled to contain and force the energy to dormancy inside his body, but as he was doing it, more energy bleed off, and caused more and more of the forest to turn to diamond hard crystal. It also had another effect. All the energy leaking off his body triggered someone's senses. Shadow groaned when he felt a energy coming towards him, and that was when he made a mistake, later on, he'll consider it good luck.</p><p>He took out Shade's Wrath. His blade, made from the fang of Shade's dragon form was designed to be cut through almost anything, or be so blunt it couldn't even cut through better, but that wasn't the main ability. Shade's Wrath served as a lens for him to channel chaos energy. It absorbed it and unleased it. Ranma forgot this as he unsheathed his blade. He watched in awe as the black blade of his katana began to pulse and vibrate as the chaos energy leaking off the Chaos Emerald began to be absorbed by his blade.</p><p>It began vibrating so much a ringing sound began to be hard. Each time the ring sounded out, a nearby crystal tree would shatter into shards. He groaned as the energy was being absorbed to fast. He needed to use it up somehow...his curse. He made his second mistake when he tried to trigger his curse using the chaos energy. His eyes widen in surprised as his weapon latched on to the mystical energies of his curse and began duplicating it in itself and Shade's Wrath began to change.</p><p>The blade grew long, very long it was taller then Ranma himself, stopping at a little above six feet. The hilt grew longer two as black bandages appeared wrapped around it. Ranma looked closer and saw that their were numerous markings on the bandages, but ignored them as the blade pulsed again as its width was reduced by half. The biggest thing was the sense of overwhelming power that the blade now radiated.</p><p>There was another effect as the Chaos Emerald was finally suppressed inside his body. Its going to be a strain if this happens every time he summons it. Ranma looked away from his transformed weapon and finally noticed the crystal forest around him and stared in awe at the beauty.</p><p>When he recovered he inspected himself. He was wearing the clothing he worn to the Treasure Search and by the look of his pigtail, his hair was back to the original color except it was longer now and had streaks of red. First thing first, he needed a way to conceal this forest and lake before people noticed it. He grinned when he suddenly remember the dimensional orb that contained a pocket dimension. There was a planet down there from the space station. He took his laptop from subspace and attached a multitude of sensors to the orb because he might as well get readings on his new toy. He held the orb up. "Contain"</p><p>It was a sudden reaction in which a giant vacuum appeared and in moments all around him for miles was an empty clearing. No crystal plants and lakes of silver, just dirt. He saw on his computer the forest that was newly added to the planet in the pocket dimension. It would thrive as there was an ultimate source of food, water and sun light. By the calculations, the forest would grow to cover about a thousand miles. That was when the presence that was approaching him, got bigger. It was really close now. Shadow, held his weapon out, two-handed as he bent down into a crouch.</p><p>What finally awaited him was a man that looked older then him with the whitest hair he has ever seen. His ears were pointed slightly and he had markings similar to his own on his face. Combined with the high-class robes and sturdy looking armor he made a very imposing figure, even if he was missing an arm. Plus those swords in his sash give him a weird feeling, as if his danger sense was warning him of both weapons. He was about to question his attentions when he saw the little girl hiding behind his leg, and the frog grumbling to himself further back. His senses told him that the little girl was very ill and the man must not realize it.</p><p>Ranma sheathed his sword, noticing that it allowed all of his word to fit in it and he bowed slightly. "Welcome Stranger" The man looked at his face and his face widened slightly before he too nodded his head. "Welcome stranger. Are you the source of the strange power I felt a while back and why isn't there a forest here anymore?" Ranma nodded. "Yes, something went wrong when I was testing my power. Would you mind telling me where I am." He nodded and gestured to all around him. "This, is the southern border to the Western Lands in the land the people call Edo. I am Sesshomaru, Heir to the Western Lands."</p><p>Ranma nodded and was about to introduce himself when the memories hit him. He remembered, all of it. He was Shadow the Hedgehog. He didn't remember where he was born but he remembered his life in the Silver Millennium, he remember his mentor Gerald who was now disguised as his Senshi Happosai and he especially remembered his goddaughter, Hotaru, but he always called her by her middle name, Maria. He staggered a bit as the thousands upon thousands of years worth of memories was integrated into his mind. He looked up to into the curious face of Sesshomaru. "Oh I'm fine, I'm Ranma Saotome, but you can call me Shadow. I'm-" Sesshomaru interrupted him. "NekoTachi"</p><p>Shadow blinked at hearing a familiar name. "What?" Sesshomaru pointed to his markings. "You defeated the last NekoTachi? How? The last I heard, he was banished to hell" Shadow grinned and scratched the back of his head. "Well I went on a little trip to hell recently, or a small portion of it." Sesshomaru nodded in understandment. "Ah. As the heir to the Western Lands, It'll be my job to escort you to the Northern Lands." Shadow looked at him oddly. "What?"</p><p>Sesshomaru cocked an eyebrow. "You don't know? Whoever holds the markings of NekoTachi is the Lord of the Northern Lands. You'll rule an empire once everyone sees you." Shadow blinked and it suddenly made sense why NekoTachi fought him fair and square. He wanted an heir to rule his people. Someone strong, but who he could watch. "I see, I thank you for your help. Lord Sesshomaru, would you mind introducing me to your companions." Sesshomaru nodded and pointed to the ugly toad thing. "This is Jaken. My retainer" His face softened as he gestured to the little girl, "And this is Rin...she's my ward"</p><p>Rin's eyes widened at this, but let out a wide beaming smile, the fact that she was missing a tooth made her ten times as cute. "Hi Shadow-san!" She said, before coughing heavily.</p><p>Sesshomaru bent down to pat her back as she expunged a lot of mucus. "Are you okay, Rin?" He asked. She nodded as she still coughed. "Yes, Sesshomaru-sama!" Shadow frowned. From what Sesshomaru said he was in ancient Japan, and this little girl was heavily sick with the flue. If she was in a village, she'll get hope, but traveling in the woods, in that state will surely kill her. "Allow me to help." Sesshomaru looked at Shadow, before moving aside. Shadow nodded and bent down so he could look Rin in the eye. "Hello Rin" She smiled, "Hi again Shadow-san!"</p><p>Shadow smiled, this little girl reminded him of Maria when she was young. "You're a good girl Rin, so for now on you can call me Uncle Shadow" She nodded, her smile widening. Shadow took out a first aid kit out of subspace and Sesshomaru's eyes widened. He never seen something like this. Shadow poked several parts on Rin's throat, back and stomach before reaching into his bad and pulling out some liquid medicine on a spoon. "Say Ahh" The seven year old did so. "Ahh" As Shadow gave her the medicine. She winced at the bitter taste and Shadow laughed "It may taste bad, but it should make you feel better. In fact, it should be working as we speak"</p><p>Rin's eyes widened as she exhaled deeply. "My chest doesn't burn anymore." She looked a hundred times better too, her skin wasn't so pale and she was bouncing around with the energy of three seven year olds. She glomped Shadow's leg. "Thank you Uncle Shadow!" Shadow grinned and he ruffled her hair slightly. She was improving rapidly. He looked up to see a small relieved smile on Sesshomaru's face. "I must thank you as well. I was worried I wouldn't get to the next town in time. Something tells me this is going to be a very interesting friendship." Shadow just grinned.</p><p>Several days of traveling found Shadow, Sesshomaru and Rin sitting in front of a camp fire. Jaken was sent to Sesshomaru's home to send a message to the other lords to notify them of the newest Northern Lord. Rin was sleeping in one of Shadow's sleeping bags, brought out of his subspace pocket. Him and Sesshomaru were staring into the fire in silence as they listened to the sounds of the forest. "Sesshomaru?"</p><p>Sesshomaru glanced at Shadow briefly before going back to staring at the fire. "Yes, Shadow?" Shadow pointed to Sesshomaru's sword. "I was thinking back to earlier today when you took on that Youkai" Sesshomaru nodded, thinking of how easily he destroyed the Youkai with his new blade, the Tokojin. "Yes what of it." Shadow shrugged. "I was just wondering why you were using such a weak weapon, when you could have used the strongest blade and ended the fight when it started?"</p><p>Sesshomaru looked at him in confusion. "What? My Tenseiga is a blade that can not kill" To show his point, he pulled the blade out. Shadow's eyes widened at the vast amount of spirit energy surrounding it. It felt like he was back in Chaos's shrine, only much more imposing. He watched as Sesshomaru pierced himself with his blade and pull it out unharmed. "This blade is useless. Why did my father give me this blade that can do so little, while my brother has one that can do so much."</p><p>Shadow stared at the blade and saw the unbreakable connection it had to Sesshomaru. "I think you are wrong. That blade you hold is a thousand times stronger then the one you pulled out earlier. Its just that you don't know how to use it." Sesshomaru stared at his father's legacy to him. "How is the blade more powerful then my Tokojin." Shadow grinned. "Its is easy to take a life, but it is so much harder to give life. You saved Rin with that blade right?" Sesshomaru nodded as he glanced over to where the little girl was sleeping soundly.</p><p>"I suppose you are right." Shadow nodded. "I am, your blade has powers of the spirit. Your father must have saw this potential in you and so give you a tool to use." He pulled out Shade's Wrath. "This is my blade, it is in connection with my soul as your blade is connected with yours." Sesshomaru nodded again. He has seen the power of his friends blade of curses. There seemed to be no limit to how many different curses Shadow could unleash. He then realized he just naturally though of Shadow as a friend. How easy was it to think of him like this. Rin's arrival has changed him for the better.</p><p>He remembered yesterday when a bandit tried to capture Rin, so he could use her as a shield. He left with one arm turned to stone, another rotting off, and in addition to that, he was mute, deaf, stuck in slow motion and seemed to be stuck in a state of confusion. All that happened within several seconds he lunged at Rin. "You need to find that connection with the tool your blade is and your true weapon."</p><p>"My true weapon?" He asked as he stared at the fire. "What is my true weapon?" He said to himself. "Think about Sesshomaru." Shadow said before he got up and slipped into another sleeping bag next to Rin, leaving Sesshomaru to his thoughts. 'My true weapon' Sesshomaru remember his father telling him that when he was a pup. To never rely on crutches but stand tall and face anything and that if he was ever in trouble he could call upon his blood. The very same blood that ran through his ancestors.</p><p>Sesshomaru always thought that his father referred to his alternate form of the massive demon dog. He triggered that form by letting his blood run lose. In that state he was a berserker and that was how his wayward brother manage to remove his arm. He hasn't changed since Tenseiga became active. Each time he tried, the blade would calm his blood and he'll get a feeling as if he was being scolded by his father for doing something wrong. 'So I have to listen to my blood' He thought before getting into a meditative stance. Slowly he began to tune out his surroundings. The forest faded away and the sounds of the people sleeping near him just disappeared. Soon it was just his heartbeat, breathing and the sound of the fire crackling in front of him.</p><p>He felt as blood pumped from his heart through his veins that transported his blood all throughout his body. He reached up with his clawed hand and clutched the stump were his arm used to be in shock, because he felt the sensation of his arm, but that was odd as he no longer possessed a right arm. The blood was pounding in his ears now and he felt warming as if his body was heating up. 'I must listen to my blood to find my strength, but how do I listen, when I don't know what to listen for?' If one where to look at Sesshomaru now, they would find his TaiYoukai markings glowing white, also that there was a glowing mist of sorts flowing from his markings and his mouth. The mist flowing from his mouth flowed all the way to the fire and then their was a change. The fire turned from orange to blazing white, Sesshomaru didn't notice any of this as he was so concentrated on looking inside.</p><p>Tenseiga began to pulse as mist began flowing out of it two into the fire, causing another change in both the fire and Sesshomaru. Where the fire was pure white, it now had a blood red core while Sesshomaru appeared to be crying tears of blood. His eyes where now blood red rather then golden, but he wasn't shifting to his more primal stage. Soon the mist grew to where it surrounded his body in an aura of mystical power. In the center of a fire, something began walking out. It was a InuYoukai, but it was massive and it had armor covering its legs and body. It had blood red eyes, but it radiated a sense of peace but at the same time showed a huge power.</p><p>Sesshomaru closed his eyes as he smelled a familar scent that shouldn't be there. "Father?" He could see his father in front of him even with his eyes closed. That scent, the he hasn't smelled for years, it almost brought tears to his eyes, but because he was made of sterner stuff he buried those tears. "Is that you Father" The figure behind his eyelids focused into a man. He wore robes more elegant then Sesshomaru's but had armor covering his whole upper body. [My son] Those two simple words boomed into his mind and brought a feeling of safety, love and pride. It was his father.</p><p>"But how...you died" His father laughed gently. [Do you think, death is the last stop in my journey. I came because one of my sons has called me to help him. I may not be able to say much but I want you to know that even if you have done some things I disprove off, I am proud of the man you are becoming. Stay on this path, my son and you shall find your strength. Your mother sends her love.] His father began to fade away and Sesshomaru reached out in desperation. "Wait! Father please don't go yet" His father stopped fading away and smiled. [Do not worry son, me and your mother will always be with you in your heart and soul] With that he faded away and Sesshomaru opened his eyes.</p><p>What he saw shocked him. The fire was a firing white with red core as something walked out of it. He recognized it as the alternate state his father would take. "Father?" The transparent dog nodded and grinned showing dangerous teeth. He felt liquid on his eyes and he reached up and touched his eyes. "Blood, this smells like you." He then realized that he was looking at the blood on his 'right' hand. His eyes jerked to his shoulder and found his arm had somehow regrown. There wasn't even a scar of where it was originally cut off. "Did you do this father?" The ghostly dog shook his head and pointed its muzzle at Sesshomaru. "I did this? This must be a power of Tenseiga. The dog blinked and shrugged. He was right, Tenseiga did have the power to heal as well as revive, but his son didn't do anything. Sesshomaru missed that behind him, Shadow opened one of his eyes and smiled at the great dog before going back to sleep.</p><p>The ghost dog walked up to Tenseiga and nudged it somehow. Sesshomaru got the hint and lifted the weapon and stood up, getting into a sword stance his father taught him. The dog nodded approvingly, before howling and jumping a Sesshomaru, startling him into raising his sword into an defensive block. It was pointless as the dog jumped into the sword itself. Sesshomaru watched in awe as he felt his father's essence join with Tenseiga. A misty aura surrounded the sword as it pulsed several times. Tenseiga flared a bright white before the sword changed.</p><p>The sword was now as long as his brother's Tetsusaiga, but unlike that blade, Tenseiga was now straight, like the broad swords he seen from visitors from the other empires. It was seven foot tall and three feet wide. The blade was a glowing white as the handle got longer and changed from black to white. The cross guards of the blade curved back to protect his wrists and on the hilt of the blade were his markings. The transformed Tenseiga had Sesshomaru hold it two handed, but it was as light as a feather.</p><p>What the most strangest thing was that the energy he felt fro the Tenseiga quadrupled in strength and the fact that there was white ghostly aura that surrounded his blade that at the hilt, the energy was shaped into the face of the dog that jumped into the blade. Also floating along the ghostly aura where his father's shoulder guards. [I told you I wouldn't leave you] His father's voice said directly into his head. [Until you improve your control this is the only way we can talk. Eventually I don't need to be bounded to Tenseiga to do so. Now the first thing we need to do is detransform Tenseiga. You won't need all this power except for when you really need it, so listen carefully]</p><p>He did so and with his father's instructions he turned Tenseiga back into its default form of a katana, but the ghostly aura still surrounded the blade even though it was muted some. [Now son, you are ready to learn the secrets of the Western Lands. Our people specialize in Spirit Magic and I think its time you learn the family art] He smiled at the thought of how his brother is going to go apeshit at this. He heard his father sigh in his head.</p><p>[Inuyasha was always to impatient, always concerned about learning to fight with his body. That was why I gave him the Tetsusaiga, because he needs it to protect himself from those that attack in subtler ways, like through his spirit. Tetsusaiga is full of wards that prevent Inuyasha's spirit from being corrupted and keeps his blood in check.] Sesshomaru nodded, he had fought a berserk Inuyasha. At least when he goes berserk, he is still has rational thought enough to change back. Inuyasha loses all control and fights until he was destroyed. Both father and son spent the rest of the night training in family secrets.</p><p>It was several days of peace later when something else happened. Sesshomaru, Shadow and Rin where walking through a clearing in the forest. Rin was riding on Sesshomaru's shoulders, while Sesshomaru himself resigned to having a crown of flowers on his head. Shadow was just chuckling every now and then, but had shut up when Rin offered to make him one. That just caused Sesshomaru's own laughter.</p><p>Then suddenly Shadow's Aura pulsed and arced off him in a lightening like shape. The bolt of chaos energy that had leaked off struck something in a nearby tree and the group heard a twin pair of screams before hearing two things fall to the ground. Shadow already had Shade's Wrath out and was pissed that the energy of the Chaos Emerald was still leaking out his body. Sesshomaru had taken Rin off his shoulders so she could hide behind him. Sesshomaru was about to take out the Tokojin on reflex when he remembered and his hand moved to the Tenseiga. As he drew it, the ghostly aura surrounded his weapon as his father's presence made himself known.</p><p>Shadow walked over the tree his energy struck and felt something that was eerily familiar. He felt chaos energy, a small portion of it, but it was still enough to cause a lot of problems. He moved aside the bushes, where he found two people being electrocuted by his chaos bolt. He hurried to reabsorb the energy and the two sighed in relief as the pain faded away. Shadow sheathed his weapon and picked the two up and carried them to the clearing on his shoulders.</p><p>"Do you know these two?" He asked. Rin's eyes widened as she recognized her friend and Sesshomaru's eyes narrowed as he knew the two. "Kagura and Kohaku, they are Naraku's minions." Shadow laid them on the ground. "Somehow my danger sense warned me of them but my energy is unstable, so I accidentally lashed out at them." Then his senses told him something was weird with these two. The woman had a energy tentacle going out her back and going off into the distance. It was like a tether of sorts, that somehow reminded Shadow of puppet strings. While the boy seemed to be at the point of death, but he looks perfectly healthy. The chaos energy was located in his back and it pulsed in synch with his heart.</p><p>Shadow took out Shade's Wrath and walked closer to the woman. She would have been considered a beauty had she not had that permanent scowl on her face that was still there even when she was unconscious. He did make his blade to cut through almost anything, even energy attacks, so severing a energy tentacle should be no problem. He took the blade out in its transformed state. With a horizontal swing he cut the tether off her back. Kagura screamed in her sleep as pain raked her whole body. On her back the portion of the tentacle thrashed a bit before dissolving into nothingness as the portion going off into the distance just twitched several times before falling still.</p><p>"What did you do?" Sesshomaru asking tuning into his new spiritual senses. "I just cut away a connection from her to a sickly looking tentacle that led off into the horizon. Sesshomaru's eyes widened as Kagura's scent suddenly changed. It no longer smelled like Naraku, but rather a mix between the wind and lilacs. " I think you cut away her connection to her master"</p><p>Shadow turned and faced the other downed person. He tuned his senses until he found the source of the chaos energy, but the boy's life force was tied to it. The moment he removes it, the boy'll drop dead. He turned to Sesshomaru. "Hey, you said Tenseiga was a healing blade, right?" Sesshomaru nodded. "Then can you use it?" Sesshomaru nodded, this give him a chance to test it. His eyes flared white as he slashed Kohaku with the blade. The boy jerked and went still, but he was no longer pale and didn't look like death warm over. As that happened Shadow removed the fragment from the boys back.</p><p>Examining it, he gasped. 'Its a piece of a chaos emerald, but how the hell can something break a chaos emerald. The only way I think is that it must have been sealed. "What is this, Sesshomaru?" Sesshomaru saw the shard. "That is a piece of the Shikon No Tama, the jewel of four souls. It has can give humans god like powers and boost the power of whatever Youkai hold it. My brother sought it to become a full youkai, but things happened and he was sealed for fifty years, while the jewel disappeared. Recently it came back but was shattered.</p><p>'Crap' Shadow thought. There were pieces of a Chaos Emerald all over. His thoughts were interrupted by more chaos energy lacking from him into the shard. The shard pulsed and changed from milky white to ocean blue. 'I know whose emerald this is' He thought as he watched the fragment of the Chaos Emerald turn to it's neutral color of emerald green. Sesshomaru's eyes widened as a massive energy began radiating of the shard. "What did you just do?" Shadow shrugged as he put the shard in subspace, "I just unsealed it. The Shikon no Tama holds many powers, but we should take care...of...these two" he paused when he realized Kagura was gone. She must have retreated when Sesshomaru healed Kohaku. The boy was in a coma, though. Even though Sesshomaru healed him, his internal issues would let him wake up. Shadow picked the boy up. "Lets get going"</p><p>Time past and the group is found traveling through a valley. Shadow was in the back, with Kohaku still on his back in a coma, while Sesshomaru was in the front. Rin was in-between, occasionally picking a flower on the pathway. Sesshomaru put his hand up as a signal for the others to stop. "A rouge dragon is coming." Shadow grabbed rin and gentle pulled her into the forest on the premise of seeing something cool.</p><p>Sesshomaru silently thanked his friend as he was going to put Tenseiga to the test. He won't even get in trouble with the Eastern Lord as rouge dragons are to be killed.</p><p>The dragon finally came into view and it was huge. It had four sets of wings, four heads, breathed fire and lightning and was as even bigger then the valley itself. Sesshomaru, compared to it as a small animal. Sesshomaru gulped to himself as he pulled out Tenseiga. As the ghostly aura appeared around his sword he heard he father say [Have faith in yourself son] At that moment the dragon saw Sesshomaru and in a rage unleashed a massive ball of fire and lightning that was three meters tall and wide.</p><p>Sesshomaru steadied himself as the ball of certain death approached him. Unknown to him his markings began to glow white and a glowing mist began to drift from his markings. "I got to have faith" Sesshomaru raised Tenseiga and as the ball of energy got to him he slashed down with all his might. The ball of energy rippled and stopped in its motion as Tenseiga's blade came in contact with it. The energy ball rippled again and broke apart into shards of energy that was absorbed into Tenseiga and ultimately Sesshomaru.</p><p>He snapped his head back as overwhelming energy flooded out his eyes and mouth. His TaiYoukai markings flared even higher. The dragon stopped, at first it was curious as to why its prey didn't run, but know it was feeling something it hadn't before, fear. Sesshomaru snapped his head forth and his eyes were blood red, but he was aware of everything, even somethings he had never seen before. The world sang to him as what he sensed threatened to overwhelm him. The glowing mist surrounding Tenseiga began to glow a rainbow of colors as Sesshomaru got into a stance, the mist surrounded his body and the image of his father's human form overlapped his as both yelled. "Soul's Fury!"</p><p>He slashed out and a rainbow wave of energy came out of Tenseiga and struck the fear frozen dragon. It roared as it was consumed. When the attack was over, Sesshomaru saw the dragon still flying in the air, only it was transparent. Underneath it laid the shattered body of the dragon. Sesshomaru and his father grinned as one as they raised Tenseiga. "Soul Absorb!" A vacuum appeared around Tenseiga and the dragon's soul was sucked into the blade. It gave on last roar as it suck into the blade.</p><p>A large amount of knowledge hit Sesshomaru as the dragon's skills were imprinted into his brain. This rouge dragon was a berserker mage, one that specialized in fire and lightning. He now knew how to use the spells of the dragon when he went into his own berserker mode. His father's spirit faded away as Sesshomaru sheathed Tenseiga. His markings turned back to normal as his eyes turned back to gold.</p><p>Shadow came out the bushed with Rin running in front of him. Kohaku was still on his back and on Shadow's head was a crown of daisies. "Uncle Shadow taught me how to play a new game" She came up and tapped Sesshomaru's leg. "Tag! Your it" She ran off and Shadow chuckled. Sesshomaru paused for a while as he watched his ward run through the valley. He gave a small chuckle himself as he set out to catch her. Shadow chuckled again as he turned to his right. "You have a good son sir" He said as he joined in, careful not to hurt the sleeping Kohaku. As he left the area, Sesshomaru's father's spirit appeared with a whirl of lights. He seemed surprised that his son's new friend saw him. He smiled widely at the free smile his son had on his face as he chased after what he considers his granddaughter before fading away to Tenseiga to await the next time he can teach his son. Before he fully faded he muttered, "Now if my other pup could learn"</p><p>A couple days later, Shadow, Sesshomaru and Rin stared in awe. "Is that the Northern Lands?" Sesshomaru nodded how could he have forgotten how magnificent the Northern Lands? It had been about forty years, but still. Rin giggled as she stared at the floating islands and she went up to Sesshomaru and tugged his leg. "Can I drink the pretty water" Sesshomaru shrugged, but now that Rin mentioned it he did wonder how golden water tasted like. Kohaku just inhaled deeply and continued to sleep. If he ever wakes up, he's going to kick himself for missing this.</p><p>"Floating Islands, cool" Shadow muttered. "Our home is very beautiful no" An unknown voice said. Sesshomaru sniffed and recognized that scent. "Wind Sabers" He said. "So you do know of us oh heir of the Western Lands" Sesshomaru nodded without turning around, but one hand was on his blade and the other was holding Rin's shoulder. "Who wouldn't forget the imperial guard for The Northern Lord?"</p><p>The head Wind Saber smile, showing rows off teeth. "I see our reputation proceeds us, either leave the Northern Lands or explain your reasons for coming into this territory. You and the other Lords know that our borders are closed ever since the Northern Lord was banished to hell. If I was as paranoid as my fellow guard, I would say that you are planning to invade" The head Wind Saber chuckled a bit.</p><p>Sesshomaru shook his head. "Shadow, if you will" Shadow shrugged and turned around to face the Wind Sabers and all chuckles died. "NekoTachi's marks!" All of the Wind Sabers crouched down with their heads lowered in the kind of bow that huge sabertooth tigers could. "You must come with us at once" Shadow turned two Sesshomaru. "Are you going to come with us?" Sesshomaru shook his head. "No, I need to find myself and train, but I ask a favor Northern Lord" Sesshomaru asked as he gentle nudged Rin forward. "As I train, I ask that you take care of my heir" Shadow nodded. Rin looked up at Sesshomaru with a confused look at the point of tears. Sesshomaru bent down and hugged her. "Now I want you to be a good girl for Uncle Shadow, you understand Rin?" She nodded "You'll be back, right?" Sesshomaru smiled as he kissed her forehead "I pinky promise" He said taking her small pinky in his, another thing learned from Shadow. Rin smiled and ran to Shadow. "Am I going to ride, the big kitties"</p><p>Shadow chuckled and nodded. Rin jumped on one of the cats. "Bye Sesshomaru-sama!" Shadow waved. "Farewell Sesshomaru, may you have good fortune in finding yourself and know that you and your family shall always be welcome in the Northern Lands" Sesshomaru nodded as Shadow got on the back of the head Wind Saber. With a gust of wind, they were gone and Sesshomaru could see several figures heading towards the islands. He waved and smiled as he turned and began traveling again, this time to seek further spiritual enlightenment.</p><p>A figure broke down the door to a temple so old, many have forgotten the story involving it. This temple was here before mankind had fire, built by an old powerful ancient race that had died out, but had left their legacy behind. This figure encountered many traps, but got through them all, his desperation forcing him onward to his goal. For in this temple was a power that even the lords of Heavenly Empires of the Four Directions are wary of. The figure kept on going, he wasn't going to turn back from a power that can counter the Shikon no Tama. He ignored all the warnings on the walls of the temple he's passing, he can feel the tantalizing lure of supreme power.</p><p>Finally he got to the alter, many of his clothing was burnt off and his left arm was messing. In the center of the temple on a small alter was a small round black sphere that radiated more power then the completed Shikon No Tama. He grinned and laughed cruelly as he grabbed the sphere, almost immediately he began screaming in pain as the power threatened to destroy him. His whole body was smoking as the energy drifted off of him. He released it and fell to his knees. In front of the alter, a transparent woman with no facial features appeared. Her face was just smooth, but then she began to talk. "I warn thee, who seeks this fearsome Power. Whoever uses this Power will destroy the planet and it will consume thee before it happens. Turn back now before it is too late for thee, I beg you"</p><p>The figure growled as he trapped the shining black sphere within an energy barrier, so he won't be touching it, the woman faded away into nothingness. The figure chuckled "Ku-Ku-Ku. I shall find a way to use this power and I shall take the Shikon no Tama and her" He wrapped himself in his furred cloak and walked out the temple. The transparent figure appeared after he left. "Foolish man, I pray for the safety of the planet. May Kami-sama have mercy on your soul." With that the figure faded.</p><p>Side Story 3: (Love Hina) Changes and times</p><p>Nabiki growled as she looked at her sister's boyfriend. They just came back after checking the Saotome Manor as she wasn't allowed under orders from her mother. Right now, her sister and 'him' were sitting in the living room, studying for their entrance exams. She couldn't believe her sister had fullen for such a loser. He failed the test a number of time. Can't she see that's proof enough that he's a loser.</p><p>Nabiki paled as Keitaro casually leaned over and engaged a tender kiss with her sister. "I love you Kasumi" She even watched in disbelief as her sister blushed and giggled as she returned his affections. She wished Akane didn't go on that trip so she could get her to bash this loser. It'll be so easy too. Just one swing from Mallet-sama and he'll be gone like the bad rash he is. Her pencil snapped and the other two turned to look for her. "Are you okay Nabiki?" Kasumi asked, concerned. Keitarou grinned and handed her another pencil. "Don't stress too much about your entrance exams, you'll pass them. From what Sumi-chan tells me, you are a very smart girl."</p><p>She accepted the pencil from him, even though she felt dirty. How dare him talk down at her. So what Tokyo U said her chances to get in was fifty percent. He didn't have to pressure her like that! She hates him so much. Why couldn't her sister be with someone better! Worse, any plan that she has, doesn't work as his clumsiness gets him out, or Kasumi finds out and disarms it completely. She smirked at the many ways that she was going to get rid of this loser. "Kame, could you get me a drink"</p><p>That was another thing, why would Ranma give this loser one of those cool Mecha-Chao and not her. She drooled at the profits it was going to make once released to the public. Keitaru's chao was green but had a turtle shall on its back. She tried everything to get Ranma to give her a mecha chao, but to no avail. She growled as the chao floated back in with a soda. "Thank you Kame" Kasumi looked up. "Oh you forgot to get Tama one, Hikari if you will?"</p><p>Kasumi's chao was white, but had a white flame like plumage, wings and tail. Floating over his head was a white halo that lit up at nighttime if it wanted. Another reminder of what she threw away. How could she have known that the lonely looking red head that arrived on their door would belong to one of the richest families in Japan and start one of the biggest companies in the world. It left her very bitter that she screwed herself like this. She wished that she could go back in time and make Ranma her fiance, that way she could get all that money and power.</p><p>She had so many chances to get Ranma too, a couple of nice words here, making him secure of his masculinity there and an occasional smile there and he would be eating out her hand. But now she has no chance, since it appears that he's deeply involved with that Yoko girl. Her depressing thoughts were interrupted when the doorbell rang. Kasumi looked up. "I'll get it." Keitaro got out his chair and pulled hers back to help her up in a gentlemanly manner. "Thank you Kei-kun" Kasumi went to the door and Nabiki followed out of boredom. Keitaro suddenly shivered as he got a bad feeling.</p><p>Kasumi opened the door. "Hel...Oh my!" Nabiki was shocked too, for standing in front of her was one Dr. Ono Tofu and he wasn't going crazy in front of Kasumi. "Kasumi...how are you" Kasumi smiled "Come in Dr. Tofu, you've been gone for so long." She moved aside so he could come in. Nabiki smirked as now that Tofu was here, Kasumi will dump that loser and go out with Tofu.</p><p>Keitaro saw the man come in and didn't really know what to make of him. Kasumi with Keitaro's help, set some tea up. "So, Kasumi how are you doing?" He asked when they finally got set up. Kasumi smiled even widely. "I'm doing very fine Doctor. In fact if it wasn't for Ranma, I would never had the chance to try out for school" Nabiki was hit by a pang of guilt from how her family had treated Kasumi. "That's great." He said and then chuckled. "So I guess Ranma and Akane finally got married" He wasn't prepared to see Kasumi snort out her tea and start laughing.</p><p>"You've been gone a long time, Dr. Tofu. A lot of things have changed since you left. Ranma has matured greatly and has moved back in with his mother after ending all the engagements. He's dating this nice girl now." He was stunned, he never though Ranma would end his engagement mess, and even if he did, he thought he would marry Akane. "A lot of things have changed" Kasumi nodded. "So Dr. Tofu, what brings you back to Nerima?"</p><p>Tofu suddenly blushed and Nabiki smiled. "Well, there was this woman that I loved and for the longest time I couldn't get the courage to tell her about my feelings. So I left so I can gather the courage to tell her I love her." Kasumi smiled. "That's good for you, Dr. Tofu. I'm glad you found someone to love. No one deserves to be alone which is why I'm glad I found Kei-kun"</p><p>Dr. Tofu's glasses fogged up, "Kei-kun" Keitaro smiled as he took Kasumi's hand and squeezed gently. Kasumi turned to him with love and affection. "Kei-kun is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with" She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. Dr. Tofu's glasses cracked. "He's so nice, so funny, so kind and such an amazing man. You know he reminds me of Ranma in the way they both never give up when challenged."</p><p>Dr. Tofu's glasses cracked even more when Kasumi blushed as Keitaro wrapped an arm around her waist. "So who's this girl that you love, Doctor?" She asked politely, maybe she knew this girl. Dr. Tofu. "Oh look at the time, I have to get back to my clinic." He promptly got up and tried to leave the room, only to walk into the wall. "Oh Dr. Tofu! You're so silly, just like I remember"</p><p>Nabiki frowned. Her sister broke him easily totally missing the clue about him loving her. "I'll take him to the clinic" She said nicely as she helped him off the ground. Kasumi smiled and waved. "Bye-bye" The moment they left the room, Kasumi's smile disappeared and Keitaro noticed this. He was used to the fake smile that Kasumi put up when she was upset about something. That was why he wasn't upset that Dr. Tofu was confessing with her.</p><p>"Are you okay, Sumi-chan" She nodded. "I can't believe he's back." She sighed. "He's always been in love with me, but he's almost as old as my father!" She shuddered slightly. "It makes me sick sometimes. He started this obsession with me when I was fourteen for heaven's sake!" Keitaro pulled Kasumi into his lap and hugged her. "Don't worry, I'm here, and I love you." She smiled for real this time and nearly blinded Keitaro with her beauty. "I love it when you smile for real" He said as he inhaled the scent of her hair, passion fruit. He loved that scent.</p><p>"I think Nabiki is planning something" Kasumi said "I know, she doesn't really like me, nor does Akane" He frowned as he remembered her chasing him with a hammer. "But at least mom approves" Kasumi said. Keitaro smiled when her mother ask when are they going to give her grandchildren. "Kasumi?" Keitaro asked, curious about something. "Yes?" Kasumi said half aware, if he kept on breathing in her ear like that she's going to do something that'll make him say Oh my. "Is Akane a lesbian?" Kasumi looked at him before giggling. "I don't know, now don't you have something better to do?" Keitaro grinned at her loving stare. "Like study?" Kasumi shook her head. "Lay large amounts of passion fill kisses on my Sumi-chan" Kasumi giggled as she turned around. "You always have the right answer, eventually" Keitaro smiled. "Yeah...hey" Kasumi shut him up, but he didn't mind at all.</p><p>Dr. Tofu punched the wall of a nearby building, proving that he is a martial artist by making a noticeable hole in it. "Damn it Tofu! You've lost her because you waited to long!" Nabiki sighed. "Do you really love my sister?" Tofu glared at her and pointed his bloody knuckles at her. "Does this tell you anything? Of course I love your sister. I'll do anything for her!" Nabiki sighed. "Then just get rid of Keitaro" Tofu's glasses, now a new pair glazed over slightly. "But its wrong. Kasumi loves him."</p><p>Nabiki cocked an eyebrow. "So I guess, your aren't going to be happy with her as your wife. She'll marry Keitaro and have his little bastards. You get rid of Keitaro, make it look like an accident and I'll convince Kasumi to come to you." Tofu's glasses glazed over completely. "Fine"</p><p>Monday:</p><p>Keitaro was walking down the street, he was going to the beef bowl restaurant to meet Kasumi for their date. He never knew someone who loved beef bowls as much as he did. He didn't notice when the person in a trench coat and fedora bumped into him, nor did he notice when a pressure point was pressed. Keitaro was walking across the street when his body froze. He looked in horror as a semi approached him, not being able to brake in time. 'Goodbye Kasumi' He thought as he closed his eyes.  Then he heard a crash and something landed in his arms. He opened his eyes in confusion as he found a baby in his hands and the semi flipped over and stopped in front of him. A lady came up and took her child. "You save my baby! Thank you, thank you so much!" A news truck came up and did a report of how a brave young man caught a baby that fell out the second story of a house and stopped a drug ring running in Tokyo by stopping the transportation truck.</p><p>As Keitaro smiled and said hello to his parents on the news, a very pissed off Dr. Tofu was cussing up a storm, unknowingly offending a Miko and getting an impotence curse. Keitaro walked into the beef bowl restaurant and smiled as Kasumi waved him over. "How was your day Kei-Kun?" He grinned and scratched the back of his head."Nothing much Sumi-chan."</p><p>Tuesday:</p><p>Keitaro was looking for a book in a library. He was currently looking at a very tall self. On the other side was Dr. Tofu, still in the trench coat-fedora combo. He casually pushed over the bookcase, sure that it would kill Keitaro, before running to a table to watch. Keitaro was unaware as the bookcase started to lean over him as he was lost in a certain book. The book case leaned to a point and stopped. The ground underneath Keitaro opened up, the bookcase being a switch of sorts.</p><p>The old librarian saw this and gasped before running over. "Sir! Do you know what you just did?" Keitaro a level lower shook his head as he took in the rows of unlabeled books. "You just found the Nerima lost archive. This was were a secret batch of artist would place all there knowledge of art and such. It was rumored that whoever found this books would keep them all. Just one of this books is worth a fortune!"</p><p>Keitaro later grinned as a moving truck was filled with all the books he'll ever need to improve his art to god like levels. Inside the library, Dr. Tofu was banging his head on the table over and over again, before the librarian tossed him out and banned him for being so loud.</p><p>Wednesday:</p><p>It was nighttime and Keitaro and Kasumi were on a romantic date. The two were walking through the park, especially the portion where all the flowers was. Tofu was still in the same trench coat and fedora, not even taking it off to bathe and such. In his hands was sniper rifle and it was pointed at Keitaro's head. He grinned as he pulled the trigger. "Bye-bye lover boy, Kasumi's mine.</p><p>The bullet whizzed through the air, it was a perfect shot, had Keitaro not bent down to pick up some random change. "It must be my lucky day" The bullet that meant to hit Keitaro hit the stem of a white rose, the rose full into the air from the pressure of the shot only to land in Keitaro's hands when Kasumi sneezed hard.</p><p>She got her bearings back just in time to see the rose in Keitaro's hands. "Is that for me? How sweet!" With that she gave Keitaro a kiss on the cheek, further enraging Dr. Tofu. He fired again only to see Keitaro trip, the bullet bounce from tree to tree up into the air where a man was delivering fine chocolates in a blimp. The bullet whizzed by him, causing the man to panic and drop a box of Swiss chocolates.</p><p>As Keitaro got up from his fall a box of chocolates fell into his hand. Kasumi who was sniffing her favorite type of flower looked at her boyfriend and squealed in joy. "How did you know Swiss chocolates are my favorite" This time she rewarded Keitaro with a deeper kiss that hand his legs twitching and Dr. Tofu's teeth grinded down somewhat.</p><p>"I'm not going to miss this time! DIE!" he muttered, but as he fired the branch he was balancing on collapsed and his shot went wide. As his shot bounced off a boulder, and hit the tire of a nearby limo causing a idol that happens to be Kasumi's favorite to go into the park to look for someone with a phone. Guess who she found? "Oh sir, can I use your cell phone?" the idol singer. Keitaro nodded "If you can, could you sing my girlfriend's favorite song?"</p><p>The singer liking this down to earth guy nodded and after making the call sung Kasumi's favorite song as Kasumi and Keitaro sat on a nearby bench, right in front of the bushes Dr. Tofu fell. They didn't notice his twitching legs standing out the bush as it was dark. Kasumi leaned over "What a wonderful date. Flowers, Candy and you even got my favorite idol singer to sing my favorite song. I know one boyfriend that is going to get an extra special surprise and I do mean surprise. " Keitaro blushed as the legs behind them twitched. What Dr. Tofu didn't realize was that he fallen into the one herb he's allergic too, highly allergic to the point were head will swell three times its size.</p><p>Thursday:</p><p>Keitaro was grinning like an idiot. He never imagined Kasumi could do something like that. Today, the world was a happy place. In fact rainbows where surrounding Keitaro as he greeted nearby strangers and gave candy to children. If he got any happier he start breaking out in dance and song, but as it is he just skipped merrily as he headed to the Saotome Manor to check up on Kasumi. Behind him with a rain cloud over his head and a head that was too big for his shoulders was a pissed off Dr. Tofu. His fadora looked silly on his oversized head and people were pointing at him and whispering. In his hands was one of Akane's spare mallets.</p><p>He glared at Keitaro as he lifted the mallet and threw it like a tomahawk axe. Keitaro blinked as the thing flew past him and hit a nearby cop. He shrugged as he helped the cop out the fountain. "Thank you young man, if you would excuse me" The cop pulled out a tonfa as he was facing Keitaro when he saw the strange man through the weapon. Pretty soon, the man with the extra large head was getting the crap beat out of him.</p><p>Keitaro blushed as he saw Kasumi swim in the Saotome's Olympic size indoor pool, he then realized that she was missing her top. Kasumi swam to the edge. "Kei-kun, why don't you join me?" He was in the pool before she finished talking. "Today is a great day, Sumi-Chan" She giggled as they proceeded to 'play.' Tofu groaned as his head swelled another size due the bruising done to his body.</p><p>The cop, satisfied with his revenge walked away. Some kid ran up to the beaten Tofu's body and proceeded to steal the unconscious man's wallet and stuck gum in the man's ears before running away to reap the benefits of his theft. Tofu only groaned in pain. He was going to kill Keitaro. His glasses proceed to shatter, his sixth pair this week and a flock of pidgins proceeded to use his head as a bathroom. As he twitched and woke up he groaned again. "What else could go wrong?"</p><p>Everyone in the six meter radius ran away, because he just said the wrong thing in Nerima. It was officially banned to say that phrase in this town. It began to rain and Tofu was promptly struck by lightning several times, hailstones then buried him in snow and his was then ran over by a run-away ramen cart. A passerby sighed as he looked at the scene. "Murphy's Law strikes again" He said as another flock of birds used his burnt body as a bathroom again.</p><p>Friday:</p><p>Kasumi and Keitaro were back in the park, this time Kasumi was sitting on the bench in a pose while Keitaro carefully painted her. "Now stay still Sumi-chan, otherwise I can't even began to capture your beauty." Kasumi blushed as she watched her love one concentrate on his task. In the bushes, wrapped all over in bandages, had a super sized head and stains all over was Dr. Tofu. "I hate to admit it but he's pretty good"</p><p>He then shrugged as he pulled up a crossbow. "Well, artist only become famous after they die, so see ya" He pulled the trigger, but before he did a squirrel bit his leg causing to miss his target by a mile. He got a bad feeling as he heard the arrow hit someone. He turned to see a figure in a red suit, white gloves and a red hat approach him. The arrow was lodged firmly in his chest and he didn't look happy. "Do you think this is funny?" He asked as an evil grin appeared on his face. Tofu stared into his blood red eyes and gulped. "No" He murmured.</p><p>The person cracked his gloved hands. "For such an insult to think this," He said pulling out the arrow. "I'm going to have to hurt you now" With that the person melted into black goo. Multiple red eyes opened and the goo reformed into a huge demon dog with six eyes. Tofu took one glance and started running, but that won't do any good as the demon dog pounced on him</p><p>Keitaro paused in his painting. "Do you hear that?" Kasumi blinked. "No what is it?" Keitaro shrugged. "It sounded like someone was getting mauled by an animal but I guess it was all in my imagination. Oh well, let me get finished capturing your wonderful image so I can immortalize you for all time" Kasumi giggled. "Kei-kun, you're so romantic!"</p><p>Saturday:</p><p>Nabiki sighed at the pathetic image before her. Dr. Tofu was naked, in the fetal position, sucking his thumb and calling for his mommy. He was covered in bruises, cuts and rashes. "All you had to do was get rid of one loser and you can't even do that right" He just twitched and starting crying like a baby. He was doing a very good impression of her father. At the same moment Kasumi and Keitaro came in. Kasumi shook her head at the sight before her while Keitaro bent down to examine him. "Are you okay?"</p><p>Tofu twitched. "No mommy, I don't want to go to school today" Keitaro stood up and rolled his eyes. "Okay, how did he get like this." Nabiki shrugged. "I don't know, some guy in a red suit dropped him off." Kasumi and Keitaro nodded. "That was Rouge's father" Nabiki raised an eyebrow. "He is? I though he looked too young to be her father."</p><p>Kasumi and Keitaro chuckled some. Alucard had told them about his origins. "He he, the cookie taste like mud" Tofu said babbling. Nabiki sighed as she kicked him, snapping out of his dementia.</p><p>He looked up and saw Keitaro standing over him, he screamed like a little girl and ran away crying. Keitaro looked at Kasumi "What did I do?" Kasumi shrugged. Kame and Hikari were laughing as they saw all what happened to Dr. Tofu all week. Keitaro shrugged, "Some people just can't deal with the times." Kasumi nodded. "Dr. Tofu always acts so silly. Keitaro shall we go?" He nodded and Nabiki frowned. "Where are you two going?" Kasumi smiled as they headed upstairs. "Keitaro had some of his art put in a gallery, we're going to the premier show tonight."</p><p>Nabiki frowned, Tofu was a bust, she's going to need some help, but who...wait a minute, didn't some of the residents of the inn Keitaro owns say they wanted to get rid of him, Na- something. "I think I should make a couple of calls to the Hinata-Sou.</p><p>Next week:</p><p>"So is everyone caught up on the plan" Nabiki said. Motoko, Naru, and Tofu all nodded. When Keitaro was crossing the street, they were going to attack from all four directions. Tofu with one of his poisoned darts, Motoko with her vacuum blade techniques. Naru with a bazooka stolen from Su and herself with a sniper rifle. Keitaro was going to be extra dead. She saw him coming and alerted to others.</p><p>"What a wonderful week. So quiet, but it is a tad boring" Keitaro said outloud as he carried the pizza Kasumi asked for back to the Tendo home. He was about to cross the street when he shuddered. "That's odd, its quiet warm. Why did I shiver?" He crossed the middle of the street. "NOW" Nabiki screamed into her radio. All at once, a missile, poison darts, vacuum air blade, a bullets went all towards him. There was a huge explosion as a cloud of smoke rose into the air. "No one could survive that!" Tofu said smirking. The others agreed and started to laugh merrily. The laughter died a painful death when they heard coughing.</p><p>Keitaro crawled out the open manhole in the street. "How rude! Don't people know its dangerous to leave manholes uncovered. I should complain to the city." He looked at the watch. "No time, Sumi-chans hungry!" With that he continued on his way, leaving his four would be assassins with their jaws on the ground. "No &amp;**&amp;(* way!" Nabiki said as she started cussing very loudly. A little boy turned to her mother. "Mommy, what does &amp;#(&amp;#*$ mean?" Her mother shook her head. "Don't listen to the crazy lady son, those are very bad words." With a glare at Nabiki the mother dragged her impressionable son away.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Later:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keitaro walked through the door to the Saotome Manor. He found Kasumi in the living room reading a novel. "Hey Kei-kun. Did my sister try another attempt to kill you" Keitaro nodded as put down the pizza, picked up Kasumi's legs, sat down and rested her legs in his lap. "You're sister needs some help. I'm glad I found a manhole cover. It was bad enough with Tofu, but now she's gotten Naru and Motoko to join it."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kasumi nodded as she leaned forward to ruffle his hair. "You shouldn't be worried, with your luck and Kame protecting you, you shouldn't worry about them. I'll talk to mom when she comes back and she'll talk to Nabiki about killing my boyfriend." Keitaro nodded. "But what about Tofu? He got that pressure point deal. I don't want to wake up one day paralyzed." Kasumi's war hammer was pulled out of nowhere. "Then me and Dr. Tofu will have a little 'talk' and I'm sure he'll agree to give up this foolish mission." Keitaro smiled, feeling better. "Did I tell you how much I love you Kasumi?"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;She smiled as she let go of the war hammer, it faded away. "Yes, but you should do it more often." Keitaro grinned "Lets just stay here for a couple of days." She smiled and he kissed her. "All alone, and no one would dare break into the Saotome Manor. Ranma told me he has some pretty mean things planned for those who break in."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Outside:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"We should have just done this earlier. Go in and take out Keitaro." Naru said as she, Motoko, Tofu and Nabiki marched up to the Saotome Manor. Nabiki was there mainly to get some information to sell, like the designs of the railings, or teleportation system. Naru turned the lock and found the door locked. "No door can hold me back!" She yelled as she wound up a Naru-Punch. She yelled as she punched the door. Moments later she was clutching her bruised hand, while the door looked the same, it didn't even have a dent. Nabiki tapped the door and heard a metallic ring. "Solid Metal, this is going to be hard."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Motoko moved Naru out the way. "My ki techniques can cut through anything." She slashed down and the moment she did about a dozen guns surrounded her. All of them were machine guns. A robotic voice sounded out. "Please step away from the door or I will be forced to use extreme measures. Thank you, have a nice day" With that said, all the guns cocked themselves which was scary as they were floating in midair. Motoko grew many sweat drops as she backed away from the guns. "Thank you for cooperating! Have a nice day!"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Motoko turned to the others. "Going through the front door is out" She said, everyone noticed that she was trying to steady her arm, and was failing. Dr. Tofu blinked. "Hey there's a open window!" He said pointing to the second floor. Nabiki frowned. "It couldn't be that easy" Dr. Tofu ignored her and use more of his martial art skills to jump to the window pane of said window. "Soon Kasumi, you shall be mine"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That was the moment he actually saw what was on the other side, and the others watched as a pillar of flame shot out the window to consume Dr. Tofu. "Ouchies" He flew to the ground in a blacked crisp, his clothes several degrees from turning into ashes. "I knew it wasn't that easy" Nabiki said pinching the brig of her nose. After she said that a mechanical hand shot out the window with a bucket in its hand. It tipped the bucket over the downed from of Dr. Tofu, putting out the fire on his foot, but also causing another change.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before their very eyes Dr. Tofu changed from a man to a woman. "Insult to injury" She muttered as Dr. Tofu open his-her gi pants and scream like a little girl. He-she went back into the fetal position and started to suck his thumb. "I want my mommy!" Nabiki sighed "Cursed Springs, most likely the instant stuff combined with enough water proof soap to make it last for a good while. Very cruel and unusual Saotome."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Naru looked around and found the garage. "Why don't we try going through that way?" She suggested. Motoko and Nabiki couldn't think of anything else to do, Dr. Tofu was regressing over his lost manhood, so they left him-her and headed for the massive garage. Surprisingly it was easy for Nabiki to pick the lock and they went in&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All their eyes widen as they looked at the multitude of sports cars in a multitude of colors. Each one worth more then they could ever have. Many had Ranma's name on the plates, telling them that he owned a bunch of these cars. "Lets just take a car or two and forget Keitaro" Nabiki said, noticing that Saotome left all his keys on hooks on the wall behind the car. It was so easy and Ranma wouldn't notice one or two missing for a while, but why did she get a sinking feeling. Naru and Motoko agreed and were about to reach for the keys when she realized Ranma didn't set any traps. "NO DON'T!" She screamed, but it was too late.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The cars and keys promptly vanished, holograms. Before they could leave the room, thick metal walls came down over the walls tripping them in and the ground in the middle of the room began to open up slowly, revealing of all things a lava pit. All there girls scrambled to the walls as the ground kept on opening up. All of them could feel the intense heat of the pit and knew that if they fell in, it would be very bad. Naru lost her nerve first as she began screaming and clawing at the walls to let her out. Nabiki was silent, as she was too stunned that Ranma would do something like this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;She let loose a mighty scream as the ground finally disappeared and they fell into the fiery pits below. This was it, she was going to die...or not. The lava pits disappeared to reveal a bright light and Nabiki found herself outside the home with Naru and Motoko gaping. Tofu was still rocking back and forth. Naru and Motoko shuddered. "That's it, we're through. Let the pervert live. I never want to go through something like that ever again" With that Naru and Motoko stomped off. That was something they shouldn't have done as they triggered on last hidden trap. A massive catapult launched them towards the horizon before sinking back into the ground and disappearing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nabiki wanted to get the hell out of there. She took Tofu's leg and began running, careful to avoid the spot Naru stomped off. She never wanted to be near the Saotome Manor ever again. This one day has caused at least ten years of nightmares. She took one last glance and saw her sister and Keitaro waving goodbye from one of the windows. Keitaro had a huge grin and Kasumi had a camera, they had video evidence of one of the worse nights in her life. Tofu was still babbling like a retard. How the hell did Ranma do that with the fake lava pit!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keitaro watched his future sister-in-law ran away with the idiot doctor. "Wow, you were right about the security" Kasumi nodded watching the camera again. This was something that she was going to keep for a long time. "It was like those American cartoons" Keitaro nodded, laughing at the expression on Motoko's face. "Hey, do you think it'll be wrong to make copies" They looked at each other and said at the same time. "Nnaaahhh!" Keitaro looped an arm around Kasumi's waist. "Lets just go watch this on the big screen" Kasumi giggled as he lead her to the entertainment center. Where the two proceeded to watch the tape many times, there was laughter and it was good.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Read and Review&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A/N You all are very lucky today.
