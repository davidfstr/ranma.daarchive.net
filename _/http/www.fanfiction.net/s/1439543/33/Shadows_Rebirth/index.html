</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth</p><p>A/N: Sorry for the delay, I have a lot of test coming up, so I need to study</p><p>Chapter 28: Meetings and Directions.</p><p>Inuyasha jerked up as he finally regained consciousness. He was in a bed covered in a material that was shimmering gold, but he didn't notice that. He was more concentrated on his body. There were so many changes, his strength, speed and reflexes have increased along with his senses. It was as if he was a blind man who could see for the first time or a deaf man who found that he can hear. Everything around him was radiating energy. He brushed a hand through his shortened hair and he remembered how he got here...he lost</p><p>"Yes Inuyasha, you lost" Kagome's voice said next to him. He turned and gasped as he looked at her through his new senses. She was so beautiful, so very beautiful, how could he have missed it before. The smooth feminine curves, her scent that was a mixture of lilacs and a bit of musk as she hasn't bathed yet, but that only drew him in more. He could hear her strong heartbeat as blood was pumped through her fragile but strong willed body.</p><p>He heard her breath catch as her cheeks reddened under his stare. He reached up as if in a trance and stroked her face. He and she shuddered, her in pleasure and him in awe how her skin felt. "Inuyasha?" Kagome said as she stared at Inuyasha. Ever since he turned back from that giant dog there has been changes. His ears were no longer on his head, but rather human like, only with a point to them. His marking were visible, only rougher that his brothers. His eyes were still golden but now glowed more. All in all Inuyasha looked a lot like his brother.</p><p>"Inu-Inuyasha?" Kagome shuttered. She felt so HOT inside with him just staring at her like that, all those naughty dreams that she's been having lately aren't helping her calm down, especially if he kept on looking at her like that. She rested a hand on his chest to try and push him back onto the bed, but all thoughts of that fled her as she felt the warmth of his body and his muscles twitch underneath her touch.</p><p>Inuyasha's nostrils flared as he took in more of Kagome's scent, she was getting more and more aroused and in turn it was doing to same to him. His hand left her cheek to rest on the side of her neck, so he could feel her rapid heartbeat. Kagome whimpered soundlessly, part of her hoping he'll stop but a major part of her wanting him to continue and ravage her on the spot. Inuyasha's palm left her neck to her chest as he wanted to feel her heartbeat directly. As he trailed down, his claws traced over her skin and she moaned slightly as she could feel his touch underneath her clothing. All of her fantasies were nothing like this. "Inuyasha, we shouldn't-"</p><p>He interrupted her by putting the index finger of his other hand to her lips. "Kagome, shut up" She shuddered again as Inuyasha smiled roguishly at her causing her breath to catch yet again and she whimpered again, a sound that he found absolutely adorable. He leaned forward Kagome, not that she wasn't pulling him by trapping the hand on her chest with both of hers. It only increased her desire to feel the calluses of his powerful hands. How many youkai have she seen him tear apart with his bare hands only to be so gentle with her. They could easily rip her apart, but now he's so soft with her.</p><p>Finally Inuyasha made that short but to her way to long distance and took her lips with his own and electricity flared between themselves. Something ran through both of them that only increased their desires twenty-fold. Neither notice but a marking matching Inuyasha's newly emerged TaiYoukai markings appeared on Kagome's cheek, but faded away as soon as it appeared. Both were to busy engaging in a lip lock with their hands roaming the other's body with a passion that has been building up for a very long time.</p><p>Kagome giggled slightly as Inuyasha's hands cupped her butt and pulled her into his lap. She promised herself the next time her friends from the present try to set her up with Hojo, she's going to say "Who?" and show them the hicky that's sure to form where Inuyasha is sucking at her neck. She ran her hands through his shorter spiky hair and found that even though it was spiky, it felt as soft as silk. Her thoughts were sidetracked as Inuyasha loosened the collar to her fuku enough to expose some cleavage and he began raining kisses from her throat to the top of the curves to her breast.</p><p>She saw white briefly as he playfully bit into her neck. "Oh my g-g-g-god. Inuyashaaaaaa" Her eyes briefly rolled into the back of her head. She thought that if he could do this to her by just touching her, what happens when they go all the way? Kagome was too aroused to realize she thought when they go all the way instead of if. Inuyasha was about to completely remove her shirt when someone coughed.</p><p>"I never knew you were that friendly, brother?" Both Kagome and Inuyasha froze, Kagome swore to herself, how could she forget Sesshomaru was resting right across the room? Her face was so red it was almost purple with the amount of blood rushing to her cheeks. Inuyasha had to tear his gaze away to Kagome to see the smirk on his brother's face. He wanted to deny what was happening, but a larger part wanted to growl, throw his ass out the room and get back to properly raveging Kagome. That thought made him match colors with Kagome's face. "Sesshomaru! What are you doing here?"</p><p>Sesshomaru rolled his eyes. "I won, but you gave as good as you took." He chuckled to himself. "You really have grown stronger Inuyasha, had you had my level of stamina, you could have won." Inuyasha glared at him, noticing that he held both Tenseiga and Tetsusaiga in his hands. "I guess you get to keep my weapon, Western Lord" Inuyasha said bitterly. Sesshomaru shrugged. "I guess I do," Inuyasha lowered his head, feeling depressed that he lost his father's gift. That was when something hit him in the head. He raised his head, about to cuss Sesshomaru out for rubbing his victory in, when he saw what he was hit with</p><p>It was Tetsusaiga in its sheath.. Sesshomaru was grinning. "You whine too much brother" His grin only widened when he saw the pure disbelief on his brother's face. "You're...letting me keep Tetsusaiga?" Sesshomaru closed one eye as he rested back in his comfy bed. "I have no need for a useless weapon-" Inuyasha's eye twitched at the insult to his weapon. "but I could keep it if you don't want it" Inuyasha in an instant was clutching the weapon to his brother and even childishly stuck his tongue out. "Naw, I think I'll keep it, it's so much cooler than your Tenseiga any day of the week."</p><p>Sesshomaru rolled his open eye. "Sure it is, tell me that the next time I kick your ass" Inuyasha glared at his older brother and was about to respond violently when a blur landed on his brother's stomach. The blur turned out to be a hyperactive seven year old that was jumping up and down. "That was so cool Sesshomaru-sama! With the glowing swords, the big blast, but the coolest was turning into a big doggy!" Sesshomaru chuckled as he rubbed her head. "I missed you too Rin. Tell me, have you been a good girl?" She nodded vigouisly. "I been playing with all these people with cat ears while Uncle Shadow was traveling, even this very big cat with huge teeth"</p><p>She cutely opened her mouth and pointed to her teeth. "They went down past the mouth. You know, the big kitty that could fly!" Sesshomaru grinned and Inuyasha gapped. That little girl was playing with one of the massive Wind Sabers that took them to the island and wasn't at all scared. "But you still like dogs better than cats, right Rin?" Sesshomaru asked playing with his ward. She nodded excitedly. "Come on, lets go play Sesshomaru-sama" He nodded and got out of bed to reveal a simple Yukata that was open to show his bandaged chest and a pair of loose pants, a new pair as his old clothes were mostly shredded during the fight and his dragon scale armor hasn't grown back yet. "Come Rin, let's leave your uncle and his mate so they can play" Rin giggled and waved goodbye as Sesshomaru gave her a piggy back ride out the room, leaving the two inside blushing heavily.</p><p>Shadow was outside, looking up into the eternal night sky of the Northern Lands, the magic allowing the night to over power the day. There was a crescent moon in the sky rather than the full moon. It would be a normal thing to find him stargazing, had he not been standing in the middle of the newly formed lake. The water didn't even ripple from contact with his feet. His blue eyes were glowing in the dark while casting his face into shadows. All in all he made a very imposing figure. That was how Amy found him.</p><p>"Shadow?" He looked down from the sky to see his love watching him from the shore of the lake. He smiled at her and it only grew to see her blush and her breathing increased. "I've missed you Amy" He said looking back up into the sky. She smiled. "Then why don't you come over here and show me how much you've missed me. Amy was wearing a nightgown of pure glowing pink. It was as if she herself was wearing a star on her body. "Why don't you come over here and show me how much you've missed me" He teased slightly, not even looking to know that she's pouting.</p><p>Amy looked at him and than turned to the golden water he was standing on before going back to him. "You got to be kidding me, I'll get wet" Shadow only smiled gently and waved her to come closer. "Thing's aren't as it always appears." He said as he bent down to touch the golden water, this time a ripple was formed. Amy shrugged and took a step, the water was warm to the touch, but she wasn't falling it to her amazement. She grinned as she ran towards Shadow and trapped him in a hug that has been waiting ever since she seen him again. "I messed you" She said as she tightened her hug.</p><p>"I know" He said kissing her forehead. He grinned suddenly as he leaned backward and fell, taking her with him. She gasped in shock as they fell through the surface. Amy giggled as the water as warm as a hot spring. Somehow her glowing nightgown had turned into a very sexy glowing one piece swimsuit with the back exposed. Shadow had a simple pair of trunks, but all his TaiYoukai markings were visible. "Tatoo's?" She asked after they surfaced, she rubbed her fingers over his markings, taking a joy as she felt his muscles. Shadow sook his head. "It's more like a birthmark. A symbol of my station."</p><p>She shrugged. "So tell me, what have you've been doing since you disappeared from the present using Hyper Chaos Control" Shadow grinned as he trapped her in a hug and captured her lips in a kiss. After that he began telling her of his time in the past while she in turn told him of hers Lara's and Usagi's travels. It was just the two of them to enjoy the eternal nighttime.</p><p>"Saturn?" All the Senshi but Usagi and the outers were shocked at Hotaru's upper transformation. They were all sharing a room, to have a impromptu Senshi meeting. Right now Hotaru was showing off her upper level transformation. "Yeah, it's cool huh." She said causally twirling the Silence Glaive like a baton, it even had a trail of purple energy follow it as she spun it in different shapes. "You got to tell us how that happened?" Makoto said.</p><p>Saturn was about to speak when Usagi interrupted her. "It's pretty easy, she was in contact with a portion of the Chaos Emerald. It caused her powers to 'evolve' or something like that. They did tell us that getting a Chaos Emerald would have boosted our powers, so Shadow and Dr. Robonitk sealed them." The others froze at Usagi's very intelligent answer when a disbelieving Rei ask. "Oh and how would you know that?" Usagi grinned as she took out her broach.</p><p>It had gone under a change. The silver crystal was still there, only in a starburst shape. Surrounding the crystal was a full red moon. "SUPREME MOON CHAOS TRANSFORMATION!" They watched as Usagi was surrounded by a white glow. Behind her a red moon appeared as six silver energy wings appeared. Her clothes shattered into bits of silver energy, but the wings covered her body. Two hiding her breast and two hiding her privates while the last two were fully expanded. With a turn in a circle the lower two wings formed into a skirt while the one's covering her breast formed into a body suit. Over her chest, was the broach. The moon image behind her, glowing before shrinking over her hand and forming into a scepter</p><p>The scepter was more like a bo staff that had metallic vines wrapped around it. On the top was two crescent moons intersecting each other, one was golden while the other blood red. Last but no least, the earrings, tiara and footwear appeared. Instead of heels she wore comfortable steel toe boots that reached up to her knees. Usagi grinned as she flapped her wings, they were longer than Hotaru's purple ones. All the Senshi were gaping. Like Hotaru's, Usagi's skirt came down to her knees, and the fuku had body armor guarding her arms sides and a choker protecting her neck and like all the other Senshi, there won't be any embarrassing panty shots.</p><p>Usagi lifted a foot off the ground to show her wings worked and spun in midair, showing the the skirt stayed in place, even upside down. "You like? I think this version of the uniform is much more battle ready." Setsuna was gaping more then the others. Hotaru's transformation, she figure because she was the daughter of a being that uses chaos energy so she in turn inherited that ability, but her princess? "Usagi? How" Usagi grinned. "When I was hit by the Hyper Chaos Control, it evolved my powers, but it was a gradual thing so it took time for it to complete." She shrugged and detransformed, going back into her night clothes. She reached for a snack that's been provided for them and grinned at Hotaru. "So Hotaru-chan, I hear that you and that Tails guy has been kissy, kissy lately." She got the pleasure of seeing the Senshi of Destruction blush and start stammering like a school girl about her boyfriend.</p><p>Vash stared at the eternal moon, next to him was Alucard, both were drinking again. Shadow and him had a tradition of drinking together, and recently they added Alucard to it when they found out he could in fact get drunk. "I like it here" Alucard said taking a drink. Vash grinned. "You would, what vampire wouldn't enjoy a place that's forever night" Alucard nodded. "Good point."</p><p>"Alucard stopped drinking as he saw something fall towards them, Vash, also sensing the attacker, put down his drink and raised one of his casters and fired a shot. "Shell number 8" He said as a black energy snake exploded from the barrel of the gun and shot up into the nighttime sky, it really didn't matter though as whatever was falling towards them was already dead. So the energy snake, like it functioned, just wrapped around the corpse and brought it down before the two of them.</p><p>"It's a wolf Youkai" Vash commented, Alucard nodded and didn't waste any time draining the dead body of its still warm blood, it was too tempting for him to resist as the throat has already been torn out exposing all that blood. "But what did this" Vash wondered as he kept his gun out. "Wind Sabers" Alucard commented as he finished filling up. "They are on watch twenty four seven, because due to their nature don't require sleep to restore energy."</p><p>"You are mighty educated for a vampire" Came from the shadows as a Wind Saber appeared out of nowhere. "Do make sure not to attack any of our people. This and about five other groups of Wolf Youkai made the mistake of breaking into the Northern Lands. From what I saw they were spying on the women that came with the Western Lord and his family." Vash nodded, he was going to have to tell the others. "Are their any more?" The Wind Saber nodded, "Lord Shadow is taking care of it, as I saw he was quite upset with being interrupted when he was with one of his mates.</p><p>Shadow growled as he glared at the whimpering wolf Youkai. He was dressed only in a pair of slacks and held Shade's Wrath out in its fang mode. Amy was wrapped in a blanket, quite pissed looking too. The would be assassin was completely stone from the neck down, his face was covered in boils and was contorted in an expression of never ending pain. "You son of a bitch! I was this close!"</p><p>Shadow blushed as Amy slammed the attacker with a blunt table and again sighed, knowing that Amy would never use it on him, especially there. The youkai whimpered, he would think since he was solid stone down there, he wouldn't hurt. As it was, Amy's hit was causing thousands of cracks, to run along his body. Amy whistled and a Wind Saber dropped out the ceiling. "Get rid of him" She muttered. The Wind Saber nodded and faded away, along with the attacker. Shadow didn't get the time to ponder how Amy was able to summon a Wind Saber when he found himself back on the bed, resuming their previous...cough cough... discussion.</p><p>Big looked up from his instruction of fishing rods to Kanna, the little girl was as fascinated in fishing as much as she loved mirrors. That was when he saw something heading towards him out the corner of his eye. "Now Kanna, practice your swing and I'll be right back." She nodded, distracted by the shiny pole in her hands. Big got up and cracked his neck before going out the open door. He closed it behind him and walked into the darkened hallways.</p><p>His ears twitched as he picked up the sounds of footsteps approaching him. "Just like Antarctica" He muttered as he ducked underneath a set of claws aiming for his neck. His assailant didn't even get the chance to defend himself when Big's massive fist slammed into him in an uppercut. The attacker flew up into the air and hit the ceiling hard enough to make an indent into it along with the sound of his back breaking in several places. Big shrugged and waited as gravity asserted itself and his attacker fell to the ground in a broken heap. "Weaklings" He muttered as he grabbed a foot and headed towards someone so they could interrogate him.</p><p>Several Wolf Youkai were running through the darkened halls of the palace looking for their targets. The North, South, East and Western Lords along with the miko's. Right now there was a group of six sneaking around, there were more, but they've been separated when several Wind Sabers caught them. That forced them into smaller groups as there plans were being shot to hell.</p><p>"Are you afraid of the dark?" A feminine voice said coming out of nowhere. Several jumped in fright and began turning their heads and flaring their nostrils to try and find whoever spoke, but they found no scent. "You should be" Said the voice. One of the wolf youkai, screamed as something dragged him away from the group. The others followed and only found a cooling body, drained of all blood. "Poor, Poor Wolfies. I can smell the fear coming out your bodies," Other was dragged into another direction, not even getting a chance to scream. Him too had his blood drained when he was found. "I can taste the sweat pouring out your foreheads"</p><p>Another one crumpled to the ground, his head being turned all the way around. "I can hear your hearts beating faster and faster, the more I kill" The remaining three decided what ever was killing them was too much for them and so they ran as fast as possible. It didn't help as the scream of one more echoes through the hallway, signally that one more had fallen. This only scared the last two wolf youkai, who decided to stick together. That was when they ran into something.</p><p>When they saw it in their limited night vision, they immediately thought how could they consider themselves wolves. It was damn big, hairy but over all very powerful. A bipedal wolf that was looking at them through glowing lupine silver eyes. They took in its scent and knew that it was an alpha male, and that no matter what they do, it was easily going to rip out there throats and feast on their pathetic remains. One of them pissed themselves and fainted when they gazed into the predator's eyes and the other tried to charge, shrugging off the feeling of helplessness. His face promptly obtained a fist imprint and he two was out.</p><p>"You overdid it Rouge" The werewolf said causally. The vampire melted out the shadows, wearing nothing but a skimpy robe. She pouted as she wiped the blood from her prey. "Come on Knuckles, they interrupt our personal time! I want to get back to playing Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf" It is true that werewolves could blush as Knuckle's slightly red tinted fur was now crimson. Rouge giggled. "Oh what a big mouth you have" She squealed before running off into the shadows. Knuckles chuckled as he got back into it. "The better to eat you with my dear!" He growled as he chased after her love. Tails closed his door. "I didn't need to see that"</p><p>Sonic stared at the board in front of him. He needs to make a move, but the opponent across from him, knows all his moves, so he needs to tread carefully. He picked up a piece before shaking his head and putting it back down on the board. His opponent smirked. "Getting nervous?" Sonic glared. "Shut up" He grinned as he saw his move, "Queen takes Rook, check"</p><p>His opponent gaped at the chess board, It was a fine set, provided by the craftsmen of the Northern Lands, made from white ivory and black onyx on a crystal board. "Getting nervous?" He said to mock his opponent. All he got was a roll of the eyes and a smirk. "King takes Queen, check" Sonic glared as his king was in danger from the Bishop that was right in position of his King. "Knight takes Bishop, check" He got a sneaking feeling when his opponent's smirk only got bigger. "Pawn takes Knight, I do think that's checkmate"</p><p>Sonic glared at Sonic, and before they could get into a fight, Aurora giggled. "My, that was entertaining." She said clapping at the intense chess match. In its sheath, the Sonic Striker was glowing blue as Sonic was using one of its specialty moves, the Sonic Flash. The Sonic that won, bowed and faded away as the glow receded from the blade. The remaining Sonic's hair lost its metallic blue look as he turned back to normal. As it was it was just Sonic and Aurora in an entertainment room that was designed like the living room of the Saotome Manor in the present, only it was bigger.</p><p>"I can't believe I lost to myself." Sonic muttered, only increasing the Eastern Lord's giggling.</p><p>The two have taken to hanging around each other as there was this attraction between the two. Right now Aurora was in a kimono of flames, one of the specialties of her people were making clothing out of flames that do not burn, it would have been pointless if they did burn as she was a phoenix. Right now all her wings were gone and her multicolored hair lost its flame like appearance, but none of that took away from her beauty, Sonic found himself thinking.</p><p>"So Lady Aurora, I was wondering, how many wings do you have? I've seen you with from one wing to ten." Sonic asked as he slipped the chess set into subspace. Aurora cutely put a finger to her lip. "I'm known as the mother of Phoenixes because when I separate two of my wings, they become new Phoenixes based on the color." Sonic pouted slightly, "But that doesn't answer the question"</p><p>Aurora giggled again. "Okay I'll tell you, the most amount of wings I ever manifested was a thousand wings." Sonic gaped slightly. "A thousand wings, that must have looked pretty cool" Aurora shrugged, "It may have been, but it was painful to go through all that." That was when the door explodes and a group of Wolf Youkai rushed through.</p><p>Sonic sighed. "Chaos Control" he muttered as the room froze due to time stopping. Sonic got up and causally did each attacker enough damage so that it would knock them out when he released Chaos Control. He than sat down back in his seat and released his move, all the attackers silently fell to the ground in a heap with bruises forming all over their bodies</p><p>Aurora clapped in amazement. Sonic grinned. "Now where were we"</p><p>It was the next day in one of the central rooms of the palace. Sitting around a table that was shaped like a four point star were the north, south, east and west lords. Shadow was on the northern point wearing black shimmering robes with red slash marks. Aurora, on the southern, had robes made of fire. Dracon, on the eastern point, was in samurai armor that rippled like waves of water. Finishing up on the western point was Sesshomaru; his robes look regular, but had thousands of glowing characters as his clothing was infused with spirit magic to help boost his powers.</p><p>All four lords looked at each other, to each one they and the others basically ruled the world. It was a good thing they had a permanent trace going on because a war between these four would destroy everyone involved. It was Dracon who stood up as he was the one to originally request this meeting. "There is another reason why I asked us to meet, rather than the titles of western and northern lord being filled"</p><p>He pulled something that was a mix between bone and diamond. "A couple of weeks ago, this activated" In response the thing changed into a bone and diamond dragon that was in a defensive crouch. "This my friends is the Dragon's Cry Stone" Aurora gasped in horror but the other two didn't get it. Shadow was worried. "What is it?" Aurora was the one to speak. "In order to explain the Dragon's Cry Stone, we need to go into a history lesson"</p><p>She herself pulled out a shimmering globe and placed it on the table, with a few muttered words the globe activated and Shadow's eye's widened. "A holo display!" Aurora nodded and Shadow was stunned to himself. He was in the ancient past, how could the natives have advance technology? Sesshomaru was slightly confused, but was more excited. He had always wondered how the Western Lands had technology eons ahead of humans.</p><p>The holo display was showing a picture of the planet, she pressed a random point and it zoomed to one of the cities, which where much more advance than the villages Shadow seen in his travels. "Eons ago, our planet was visited by an ancient race of people and their goddess. They were cast out of their homes in the stars because of their beliefs. You see these people worshipped the chaos in their everyday lives and because of their strong beliefs they began to be able to tap into the natural chaos around us.</p><p>When they first did so, they came into contact with the Goddess of Chaos, whom they decided to worship instead of their own. The others were not happy about this so these people fled out of fear of being slain and out of love their goddess followed them. The planet they came to was Earth, when they first arrived, it was completely barren and unfit to live in, but due to their abilities and beliefs they created a special thing. It was the Lifestream. A river of pure chaos energy that ran underground throughout the whole planet. By making this lifestream, a paradise and in doing so became contacted to the once barren planet on many levels."</p><p>Shadow could see that this came from a time even before him and was mystified by what he saw. It was paradise, one of chaos, people thrived on the constantly changing environment. From his memories of the Silver millennium, technology was like the modern day except the advance space travel. His thoughts were interrupted when Aurora continued. "This people because of their beliefs and vast life span were called the Ancients. Earth was a paradise for thousands upon thousands of years. But soon that all change. People from the Ancients old home rediscovered them, the Ancients have been gone so long that they were forgotten by their birth world and their goddess was told as a monster from fear of their first goddess. The people saw the Ancients' paradise and wanted it for themselves, so they came without the Ancients' permission and decided to make homes here. They quickly found out that the chaotic lifestyle of the Ancients was too much for them, and so they started to try and change everything to how they lived. You see these people lived by tapping into the life energy of the planet they were on to do everything they needed rather than self survival and coexistence with nature of the Ancients."</p><p>Shadow and Sesshomaru saw how thousands of ships came to the planets and more cities were built, only these weren't as beautiful as the Ancients' cities. "The way these new comers siphoned energy from the planet was organically through plants that tapped into the planets core, but the chaos energy of the planet quickly killed these plants as the energy was too pure to siphoned like that." On the holo sphere it was seen that massive trees were planted on the surface of the planet only to quickly whither and die.</p><p>"It was discovered that the Ancients knew how to tap the energy of the planet and so the Ancients were hunted and tortured for their knowledge. Such pain, so many horrors these people went through. Eventually the Lifestream was found and there was a method made to extract the energy and taint it so the people could use it in a mockingly defilement of how the Ancients lived. They called this tainted energy Mako and through Mako, they discovered materia. Materia was the crystallization of the tainted chaos energy that gave the newcomers powers like the Ancients. By doing this, they began to slowly destroy the lifestream and without the Lifestream, the planet would have turned back into the barren place it was."</p><p>On the holo display the plush planet could be seen slowly dieing as machines and people spread all over it, with specialty machines that dug into the ground. "The Ancients were mostly killed off because of this, the tainted chaos energy was like a poison and by time they developed an immunity to it, there was only ten percent of the whole population left, who were still being hunted for experimentation. The Ancients grew very angry at the defilement of their home by the people that forced them out of their original homes so they prayed to their goddess, who had just as much rage at these people. The goddess granted these people more power and the Ancients went to war."</p><p>On the holo sphere, everyone could see the cities being destroyed through hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, lightning and even massive explosions. "Because of the immunity to mako, the ancients developed a resistance to materia, so they were quickly destroying their enemies, until the people called their goddess for help. It ended badly. The goddess quickly sealed away the Ancients' Goddess, and killed a whole bunch of them in one fell swoop." On the holo sphere there was a massive explosion of white light and the whole planet was covered in destruction. "But at the cost of the Goddess's interference, most of the people were destroyed and what was dubbed humanity was shunted somewhat. They lost the ability to travel space. The Ancients suffered much worse. There weren't even a hundred left, and in their rage and desperation they managed to get their goddesses help one last tine. They took a hundred years to do it, but it their Goddess's last gift and curse was found" Shadow's eyes widened as he saw two gems appear. One was undoubtly the Shikon no Tama and the other was a black gem resting next to it. "Two special things. One the Shikon no Tama, found in the Lifestream and the other, Black Materia found in the mako deposits. The ancients had used both of these."</p><p>On the holo-display was a horrific thing to see. Massive meteors slammed into the planet were each of the newly built cities were while the rivers changed from water to massive amounts of energy that than flooded and caused more destruction. "For a hundred years, day and night both sides fought and the planet suffered. What you call humanity was forced to regress to their basic technologies to survive while the Ancients were no more than a village remaining. They had seen the destruction they caused their planet and sworn to seal away both ancient weapons. That was when the village was attacked and destroyed from the humans who had once again forgotten their history and wiped out the village with only six ancients remaining. Four went into hiding, while decided to help humanity and intermingle with them. Sadly the sixth was captured by scientist and was experimented on when her powers were noticed."</p><p>Everyone winced as the holo display had managed to pull up some of the videos made of the experiments. Sesshomaru excused himself to lose his lunch. "They in their undoing, decided to make a human/ancient hybrid. A product of an ancient and the seed of an evil man that was mutated with the tainted mako. Even though the ancients had an immunity to it, it didn't stop the mako from mutating the ancient. The scientist saw this and froze her while taking the boy and training him to be a weapon. They did not realize that his ancient heritage would constantly attack the mako-mutated genes from his father and eventually drove the warrior insane. His name was Sepiroth</p><p>On the holo display, their was a picture of a very imposing man. He had silver hair, a sword that resembled the one of the transformations of Shade's Wrath and had one black wing that glowed evilly. This man took control of his mutated mother and learned the history of the ancients. He developed hate for the humans that created him and decided to wipe the planet clean of them, so he found the black materia and activated it at its full strength. It took the combined efforts of a bunch of humans and the daughter of the currently dead ancient that decided to help humanity to stop him. Said daughter was also an hybrid of ancient/human but naturally. They used the Shikon no Tama to cancel the black materia at the cost of the second hybrid's life. Sepiroth was weakened because of the amount of energy needed to use the black materia and was killed but the damage was done. His involvement had sent humanity back even more. The world was set back into chaos especially after the fall of the many empires that tried to take over. There was something about Earth that would cause all foreign rulers to fail. The state you see today is humanity finally starting to recover what was lost."</p><p>Shadow coughed, calling everyone's attention to him. "I think I figured it out. The four ancients that hid from everyone turned out to be the first TaiYoukai." Aurora and Dracon nodded. "All of our ancestors, including yours Shadow." Shadow blinked. "What?" Aurora giggled. "Our titles can only be past down by blood, you are related to NekoTachi. Most likely on your mother's side for I sense your lines blood run through her before my senses on her frizz out." Shadow nodded, more about his mother that he didn't know. Sesshomaru interrupted his thoughts. "Oh my god"</p><p>Dracon nodded. "So you realize why I called this meeting." Shadow looked puzzled slightly before bringing up the history lesson he just heard and what going on and he to paled. "The black materia...it was taken from where it was sealed?" Dracon and Aurora nodded, Shadow got a sinking feeling, but it was Sesshomaru who voiced Shadow's fear. "It was Naraku who took it" All they got was silence as confirmation, but there was one thing that Shadow didn't realize. Because of him and the others coming to the past, they changed the future.</p><p>It was the present and the world was in chaos from the mass murders of its leaders. This chaos so potent that it redirected energy from other leylines to ones that have been dried up for thousands and thousands of years. Ones that has been serving as a seal to keep something or someone from reincarnating through the lifeline, but now things were different now that the seal was weakened. All it needed was one thing, blood. Blood was the direct way to receive a massive jolt of chaos energy all at once as blood has power and if blood hits that sealed spot, it will provide enough of a jolt for whatever is sealed to break free . Black Wind and White Cloud were in the a cavern that they had chosen to rest in as they went after their targets. Black Wind was scowling as he stared at the blood covered blade of White Cloud. "I want to go after the one that got away. The emperor of Japan." White Cloud nodded as he shook his blade off watching the blood splatter onto the barren ground.</p><p>"I don't know how the humans did it, but they somehow developed a shield I can't penetrate, yet. Let's go and kill them all for the glory that is the empire." He faded away in a sudden appearance of fog. Black Wind smirked slightly, one of the few facial expressions he made through the whole conversation. "For the glory that is the empire" and he too was gone in a cloud of black smoke." On the barren ground the blood sizzled a bit before being sucked into the ground. A black pentagram appeared at the same spot as the earth began to shake.</p><p>All over the world, people started to get shivers. In Nerima, Cologne nearly had an heart attack at feeling the power being released. Something big was going on. At the cavern where the two assassins disappeared the pentagram made by the earth's newly activated leylines, a song began to sing. It was a mix between religious choir music, heavy metal and techno in an heavy gothic tone. Something began to raise out the ground. First was an organic looking cross that was just as big as the cavern. There was something on the cross, no more like it was the cross. It was the shape of a woman. She had the appearance of the Madonna only her hair was made out of tentacles and rather than an halo floating over her head, it was a black pentagon. On her forehead was the kanji for rebirth. It wasn't the massive woman that was the size of the cavern but what she held cradled in her arms.</p><p>It was a grown man sleeping in her arms like a baby. He wore a long black and gray trench coat that had armor on the shoulders, wrist, and on the sides. His face was angular and had an angelic quality to it. His coat was parted some to show he wore no shirts underneath it. Sticking out his left shoulder was a black ebony wing that was as big as he was. In the man's arms cradled like he was being, was a long, sharp, deadly sword that appeared to be wrapped in leather. He yawned, not unlike a child and stretched as he woke up. He grinned and looked up into eyes of the being holding him. "Is it time to play?" The mother like figure looked down and grinned from ear to ear, her beautiful face ruined by the skin ripping so the smile could literally be from ear to ear along with a row of razor sharp teeth and then she spoke. Her voice was melodious and would have been appreciated had it not belong to a monster such as this. "Yes Sepiroth, its time to wake up." Sepiroth grinned and his eyes glowed as he pulled a glowing orb out his coat. It was a perfect sphere had the words 'Ultima' not been scratched into it.</p><p>Read and Review</p><p>Sorry for the very long wait, a lot of things happened and I'm about to move</p><p>I'll try to be better about when I update, but untill I get more time, It'll be at most two chapters a mouth at most.</p>
