</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth</p><p>A/N: Nothing to say</p><p>Chapter. 23: Don't you see?</p><p>Sonic woke up leaning against a tree. He looked down to see his clothing has changed. He was wearing traditional samurai warlord armor. "Cool" He stood up and found that the armor was as light as a feather. His pack was moved to subspace and his weapon was hanging from his side. He took off his helmet to see that it had a mask that looked like a oni's face and metal horns grew out the tops of the helmet and it even allowed his long blue hair to hang out the back "I could dig these clothing" His partner Gust nodded. Sonic put on the mask. "So do I look scary" He said, his voice having changed to something like a devil. His partner nodded "Cool. Okay Gust, it's time for you to look the part" With the flick of his wrist Gust had transformed into his dragon mode. Sonic hopped onto Gust's back and pointed west. "I have an odd feeling, lets go that way" Gust nodded and with a roar, took off into the air. "I wonder what we'll find" Sonic said. The two flew for several hours until they got to an odd sight. A man with white hair, fancy clothing with armor on top and a puffy white thing hanging over his shoulder was resting over the corpse of a massive dragon that put Gust's size to shame. In his hand was one sword, while another was in a sash hanging from his side</p><p>Sonic hopped down. "Gust go hide for a while." Gust nodded and retreated. The person was just staring at Sonic. "Can you give me the fight I want?" He held out his weapon as a strange foggy aura began to glow around it. At the hilt a ghostly face appeared. It was grinning as it stared at Sonic with black voids as two metal shoulder guards floating around it. One on each side. Sonic grinned as he took out his own weapon, the blade glowing a bright blue. A grin appeared on the mans face. "Great" Sonic noticed that he had markings similar to the one's Shadow has, only his was glowing the same greenish gray color his sword was. "What is the name of my opponent" Sonic asked as the man's eyes started glowing with the same greenish grey energy, no long able to see what his eyes look like. "You can call this TaiYoukai Sesshomaru."</p><p>"The name is Sonic" Sonic's hair, still sticking out the helmet began glowing the same blue his blade was. Nearby a branch fell to the ground and that was the symbol for the two to start fighting. Both men charged at each other. If anyone had been watching, they would have seen blurs but to each other, they were moving in slow motion. Their blades locked with a shower of sparks. Sonic chuckled through his mask. "You are pretty good, Sesshomaru, but you're going to have to be faster to beat me" Sesshomaru chuckled and freaky enough so did the ghostly face on the hilt. Sesshomaru spoke, his voice coming in stereo. "You're going to have to do more then that" His hand jerked and the two were sent back several feet. All around them small trenches appeared from the force they hit.</p><p>Sonic led the charge as he arced his blade to slice up into Sesshomaru hadn't brought his weapon over handed to block the blow. More sparks came out when the blades collided and a crater was formed from the force used by both sides. Sonic redirected his blade and struck again this time aiming for Sesshomaru's side, only again it was blocked. Sesshomaru smirked. "You know this blade was made from my father's fang. I was always jealous because the sister sword seemed so much more powerful then this one. It could kill hundred Youkai with one swing. While I got a sword that couldn't kill"</p><p>Sonic smirked. "There's more to it, if you're fighting me with a sword that can't kill, it makes this fight kind of pointless" He said as he ducked underneath a blow that would have took his head off. "Of course. I should have realized that while my bother's blade was too make to protect his body, mine was to protect my spirit. I never realized how powerful the spirit is. To be able to use the strength of the dead as my own." The aura around the sword pulsed and doubled in size as Sesshomaru became twice as fast. Sonic blocked it, but it was much harder then before. "So you are holding back on me?"</p><p>Sesshomaru smirked. "Of course. I don't want to defeat you so easily" Sonic chuckled. "Then I guess I have to increase the pace of this fight" The aura of his sword flared as it turned into an even brighter blue. In response, Sonic's hair turned an even brighter blue. "Sonic Flash!" In a flash, where there was one, is now five. Sesshomaru didn't look impressed. "I seen that before. Fox Sorcery. All the other's are illusions." All the Sonics chuckled. "You think?" They said before they all blurred into different directions and attacked a surprised Sesshomaru.</p><p>Sonic managed to get many cuts on Sesshomaru, but he dodged enough so that only his robes took the slashes. Despite how magically enhanced his robes were to absorb damage, Sonic's sword slashes cut right through. Sesshomaru looked at one of his sleeves that was still hanging on his arm by threads. "Now I'm really impressed" He said as he ripped away the top of his robe and shattered armor. It turned out that underneath the robes was a thin layer of a metal plated shirt. It was only the ridges formed by the plates that kept it from being skin tight.</p><p>"I figured you would be smart enough to wear armor under those robes." One Sonic said. "But it won't do you any good" Said another as that one blurred and slashed across Sesshomaru's chest with a shower a sparks and was surprise to see not even a scratch on the armor. "Dragon hide, it's the strongest material out there" Sesshomaru said as he countered another slash from a Sonic attacking from his left before jumping to avoid the slash to his legs by the one attacking his right. "You are very good" Sesshomaru said as he placed his blade over his back, deflecting another blow from another Sonic attacking from above before using a kick to knock him to the ground.</p><p>The five Sonics looked up. "If five won't do any good, I guess I have to increase the number" Another flash and in the place of the five were ten. All of them jumped up at different angles, each one has their blades arranged in a way so even if Sesshomaru blocked one then the others would connect. That was proven moot when Sesshomaru's arm blurred into ten blades and blocked each one of Sonic's attacks. "I wonder, how many can you do before not being able to separate the actions." Sesshomaru said out of curiousity. It was quickly becoming obvious from both sides that this match has become nothing but a sparring contest. "Let's make a deal. If I can cut you with in the next two minutes, you let me study your sword"</p><p>Sesshomaru grinned. "What do I get if I win?" The Sonics paused in thought. "I'll teach you how to do this" Sesshomaru nods and gets into a stance as his energy flares. "I agree, prepare yourself" The energy surrounding his sword grew until it resembled a demon dog. The extra Sonics faded away to one as Sonic flared his aura. "Okay are you ready?" With Sesshomaru's nodded Sonic flared his aura again, this time tapping into his Guardian Emerald. "SONIC FLASH!" With a flare, Sonic's image was concealed with a bright burst of energy. When it died down, Sesshomaru lost his dignified pose and gaped as he looked at what seemed to be over a hundred Sonics all in stance.</p><p>"Are you ready? Lets Go!" And each and every one blurred towards Sesshomaru. He tried to dodge and even cut a few down, those that he did just turned to energy vapor that was absorbed by the others. Even though the Sonics were slightly slower, they managed to overwhelm Sesshomaru. "Gotcha!" One yelled the moment the first cut got on his left bicep. After that all the others disappeared and Sonic was panting lightly with Sesshomaru. "That was interesting. I should see what else you can do" Sesshomaru said as he handed over his sword. The greenish-gray aura and ghost appearance disappearing as he let go of the sword. "Don't worry I'll give this back to you in perfect condition" Sesshomaru nodded. "Until then I'll be traveling with you and see what else you can do" And that was how Sesshomaru, TaiYoukia Lord of the Western Lands began his travels with Sonic.</p><p>Akane woke up by herself in the middle of the forest. She stood up and groaned as it was discovered her fall caused many bruises to form. "Stupid dragon" She muttered. She looked around and found her backpack a little off away from her, she was by herself. She looked down and gasped at her clothing. "Why am I dressed in the battle dogi?" It had been destroyed earlier. She grinned, not complaining about her good luck. Then something big dropped down next to her, she screamed in fright and jumped back, before remembering to get into a defensive stance.</p><p>Whatever it was, it was hairy. "Run" It said in a bestial voice. It's red fur was slightly spiked back. Akane stared dumbly at it. "What?" Hissing began in the background and echoing through the forest. The beast stood to it's full height, almost reaching nine feet tall. It's torso was lacking any clothing, but its powerful arms were completely covered in metal and the most of the hands/paws were too, only leaving the sharp claws exposed. The beast's legs were dress in loose pants that was covered in leather straps and zippers. Hanging from a metal harness was a massive spiked mace that looked like it can do some damage</p><p>"Run girl!" It yelled as it turned, facing whatever was coming. Akane almost growled. "Hey, I'm a martial artist too! I can defend whatever is coming, so back off, freak!" The werewolf turned to her and growled some more. "Suit yourself, but something is coming that I don't want to meet and it is pissed off, big time. I was just warning you" It said, before turning, and dashing off into the opposite direction of the hissing. Akane only rolled her eyes as the werewolf ran off. "Coward. I can beat anything that comes my...way?"</p><p>Out the forest, came seven massive heads that seemed strangely familiar. Akane was now staring at seven heads of the Orochi, only these where five times bigger then the main head she saw last time, so that made her whimper to imagine how big the main head was. The Orochi turned to her and glared with green glowing eyes. Akane looked down and found that she soiled herself. She whimpered before grabbing her bag and running in the direction the werewolf did.</p><p>It was too late though as the Orochi had set its sight on her and was now chasing her, not even bothering to go around the massive trees of the forest, but rather through them. Even with the battle dogi, Akane wasn't getting that far ahead. All it was doing was keeping her from falling to the ground the many times that she tripped on roots. The heads of the Orochi was moving like whips to get at her, their jaws snapping and flinging drool at her. Akane whimpered some more when she saw some of the drool melt through what it touched. "This sucks" She screamed as she ran. There was no Ranma to save her this time, nor was there any stupid horn to put the beast to sleep. She even doubt that it would even work.</p><p>She screamed again when the heads began throwing balls of flame, lighting, acid, or ice out of their mouths. This forest was quickly being destroyed, by the enraged monster. "I should have listened to the freak" Yes even with her life in danger, Akane will never change, and because of that, Karma will always bite her in the ass as it's about to do. Akane cleared to forest only to face a massive cliff where she was cornered. Her choices. Jump and hope that she could land in the canopy of the massive trees below the cliff or double back and risk facing the quickly approaching Orochi. "I'm not a freak" The werewolf said as it emerged from the forest. He looked over the edge and looked back to see the first head about to emerge. He took a deep breath and leapt off the cliff, with a gaping Akane watching. "I suggest you jump" He said as he fell.</p><p>Akane frowned "I can fight the Orochi, even if it does seemed to be powered up, but it doesn't matter. I don't need Ranma!" She yelled, which wasn't a good idea as seven heads whipped out the trees, all heading in her direction. "But I'll retreat" She said as she leapt off the cliff, just barely avoiding getting torn to pieces. The last thing Akane heard before she hit water was the roar of the Orochi.</p><p>She woke with a jump, coughing out water. She was laying next to a river. The werewolf was sitting in front of an camp fire, cooking some meat over the fire. "I can't believe you don't know how to swim. I didn't even know a person could sink that fast into the water. Luckily I pulled you out and resuscitated you back to the land of the living." Akane glared at him and charged at him. "Pervert! How dare you kiss me!" She yelled, totally missing the point about him saving her life.</p><p>He didn't bother moving and when the mallet impacted on his head, he didn't budge and the mallet broke into pieces. "Are you done being a retard. I just save your life and this is how you repay me? Trying to smash my head open" Akane continued glaring at him. "You kissed me" He gagged. "Do you know that you're breath smells like fish. If I wouldn't have felt guilty later, I would have let your ass sink. I saved your life and you bitched. Now lets go on our merry ways." She huffed and stomped off. "Like I need your help!" As she began walking off. "Oh and remember, this is Orochi's forest. He's still out there and hungry! HA HA HA HA!"</p><p>She gave the laughing werewolf the finger and continued stomping off into the woods. Hours later, she was cold, alone and lost. "Where I am?" She muttered to herself. It was getting darker by the moment and she definitely didn't want to be in this forest at nighttime. She turned around a tree and came to a familiar campsite. The werewolf was sitting cross-legged, still staring into the fire. Next to him was the remains of whatever meat he had cooked. "I thought you didn't need my help?" He said, not even turning around to look at her.</p><p>"How?" She said irritated. She was lost, upset and hungry. "Its all about the nose. I smelled you go by my campsite about six times. You've been traveling in a circle girl" He said. She glared at him but sat down in front of the fire to try and warm her bones. "Who are you anyway?" She said after a while. "You speak as if you know me" The werewolf smirked, showing rows of sharp teeth. "I do know you, Akane Tendo" She stared at him with her jaw on the ground. "How" His smirk only widened.</p><p>"I can't believe him" Inuyasha yelled as he stomped off. "Who does he think he is to do this to us?" Kagome sighed. "But because of what he did we have a better chance to get the Shikon no Tama completed." He growled. "But still, I'm going to kill him when this is done" Miroku shook his head, "I wouldn't want no where near that sword of his. Who knows how many curses that blade can give?"</p><p>Kagome, Sango and Shippo nodded. "That's true." Sango said. "He was polite about not helping us though" Inuyasha rolled his eyes. "That coward, he just better not get in my way" He turned to Kagome. "Where is the shards you sensed? We've been traveling in this direction for days." Kagome shook her head. "I don't know it keeps on moving away from us, but it stopped a little up ahead." They found out way when they got to a clearing.</p><p>There was a miko with light blue hair with a metal bow in her hand and she was fighting Kagura. Leaning against a tree was a male in robes designed for the fighting monks that they seen on the road. "It's Kagura, she has the Shikon Shard" Kagome said. Inuyasha began running in their direction when the male blurred and reappeared in front of him, Inuyasha snorted and decided to just ram into him. He did so and met a steel wall of muscle and was knocked to the ground. The male stared at Inuyasha, "Do not interfere, this is Chaos's fight"</p><p>Inuyasha growled, he has had it up to here with people telling him what to do. "Don't order me around you bastard!" He threw a punch and the stranger and found his fist caught easily. The stranger cocked an eyebrow. "Did you honestly think that would stop me. It seems to me that all you demon blooded just underestimate us humans way too easily" To prove his point he began putting pressure on Inuyasha's caught fist. Inuyasha winced, this human was unnaturally strong. He tried punching with his other fist and again it was caught. "Like I said, this is our fight and she has our prize"</p><p>While Inuyasha was confronting the guy, Kagome and the others watched dumbstruck as Chaos was easily defeating Kagura. Her fan was on the ground, speared through by many arrows, portions of her clothing was smoking from were wards were placed and her face had a huge gash in the cheek where she barely missed an arrow. Chaos grinned, "You should give back the shard you stole from us before I get really mad." Kagura tried to smirk, but the gash on the side of her face prevented her from doing so. "I don't see why I should. I took it, its mine"</p><p>Chaos smirked. "Then I guess I have to make you suffer for your actions." A bonfire of blue fire surrounded her bow as runes began glowing on her bow like veins. The smooth metal bow shifted until it was mix between metal and organic. Chaos pulled out an arrow that looked like a ward and quickly fired it. Kagura couldn't dodge in time and scream as the arrow slammed into her shoulder. The left side her body began crackling with electricity as the ward did its work. Chaos walked up to her and took a bag from her before pulling out the arrow roughly. "I never like losing a good arrow" Kagura hissed in pain as she summoned her feather and retreated into the sky.</p><p>The man grinned and let go of Inuyasha before going to Chaos. "That was great" He said as he pulled her into a hug. Chaos giggled. "That was so easy. Lets get going Ryouga, I saw a hot spring not to far from here" The two left the clearing, leaving Kagome and the others watching them leave. "They have the Shikon Shard" She said before the others rushed after them.</p><p>"So why should we give you what we earned fair and square?" Ryouga asked. They had caught up to them and Inuyasha demanded the Shikon Shard. "I mean, how do we know that you're not going to do something evil with it. You're strangers." Kagome nodded at his logical question. "Well, I'm the protector of the Shikon Shards and I can sense them and purify the shards."</p><p>Chaos grinned. "So what, I can sense them too, so can Ryouga. And as for purifying, it's pretty easy to clear away the life signatures left behind by previous users." She put the shards into her hand and a blue fire incased it. When it cleared the Shards were glowing brighter then before. "So sense you don't have any good reason for us to give you this. I guess you can go" Inuyasha growled and muttered to himself. "I'm going to get that Ranma guy" But he was overheard.</p><p>"You know Ranma?" Ryouga asked. They nodded. "Are you his friends that he said where coming?" They nodded. "Can you tell us what he told you?" They did so and both Ryouga and Chaos chuckled. "Another contest, at least Ranma keeps things fun" Kagome looked confused "What?" Chaos only grinned wider. "It seems that he knew we were going to be separated, so everyone is most likely going to be rushing to collect the most pieces." The two nodded to each other and began walking off. "Where are you going" Sango asked. "We're going to where the next piece is" The two increased their pace with the others following.</p><p>Nodoka woke up in a lush bed. She looked around to find herself in a vast luxurious room. "Where am I?" Her question was answered when someone entered the room. The guy was dressed like a servant and looked normal, if you excused the tail, whiskers and cat ears. "Ah you are awake mistress"</p><p>Her expression turned to confusion at his words. "What?" The man smiled. "We smell the blood of our lord in you. You are nobility" Nodoka shrugged. "Okay. I have a couple of questions. Where am I and who is your lord?" The man walked to a balcony and gestured for her to follow him. She looked out the window and gasped. She looked in awe at the massive forest below her full of plants that she's never seen before. Looking further into the horizon, she found what looked to be a town. Only it looked as modern as her time, but she's five hundred years into the past. "You are in the great empire of the northern lands. The lord who holds the title of NekoTachi is Ranma Shadow Saotome"</p><p>"My son?" He nodded. "He is out questing right now, but feel free to enjoy yourself." She nodded and he went to walk off. "I was wondering, you arrived with two guest, and they requested to meet you for lunch. The other servant will come to help you dress" With that he was gone. Nodoka went back to her bed and laid back down. "I feel like I'm on a cloud. My Son, the Lord of the Northern Lands. It has a nice ring to it."</p><p>A couple of the knocks on the door told her the servants have come. "Come in" Several cat-girls came in holding robes made out of a material that made it glow. "What is the material in the clothing? They're beautiful" The eldest one smiled as they helped her get dress. "It is Lunasilk. Our people has a way to weave the rays of the moon into the softest material. They glow like the moon itself." She sighed as she felt the material on her skin. "It's so soft." She turned to the one that spoke. "What is your name" The cat-girl she's been talking to bowed. "My name is Gia my lady." Soft slippers of matching material was placed on her feet. "I am your retainer my lady, please call on me if you need me. Now follow me please"</p><p>Nodoka smiled as she entered the room. It wasn't the feast set up or the artwork that made her smile, it was the fact that her childhood friend, sometimes lover was there with the mysterious mentor of her son. "Kimiko! Gerald!" She said as she rushed forward. Kimiko looked up from the scroll she was writing in and grinned. "You're awake, great!" Gerald nodded and resumed eating his meal. "This is so cool" Kimiko said sounding half her age. "Your son's empire is most impressive." Gerald said. Like her both were wearing fancy robes made out of Lunasilk, but while hers were made of different shades of silver, Kimiko's was golden while Gerald's was red.</p><p>"I must say, Nodoka you and Kimiko look absolutely amazing."</p><p>Nodoka and Kimiko blushed like schoolgirls. "Flattery'll get you everywhere" He chuckled. "I think we got lucky where we awoke. According to some of the palace help, Shadow should be heading back towards here in about a week." Then Kimiko grinned. "And they told us because you're his mother, everythings free. Can you say vacation?" Nodoka got a glint in her eyes. "If you can say shopping trip" Gerald groaned when the two looked at him with puppy dog eyes. "Can you help us carry bags?"</p><p>Hotaru awoke to the feeling of moving very fast. She opened her eyes to see the scenery blur by her. She felt a pair of arms around her waist, but before she could react. "Don't worry, its just me" Tails said from behind her. Hotaru smiled, "What's going on?" She then recognized what she was riding on. It was Shade in his tiger form, in fact it was the biggest she has ever seen. Before her question could be answered, Shade jumped off a cliff. Hotaru screamed in excitement as Shade landed on the ground below and went even faster. Tails had tightened his hold on her waist. "Shade and I felt something like the chaos energies and were investigating it."</p><p>He put a shard in Hotaru's hand and it felt very familiar. "You're right, so what now" Shade jumped and began running up the wall of a cliff. "We found a bigger source of chaos energy and is going after it, but it's moving fast." Hotaru nodded and went back to examining the chaos shard. "I wonder what will happen if I put my transformation pen with in contact with the shard" She pulled out said rod and saw it glow purple and the shard of the chaos emerald glow green. "Do it, I'm curious"Tails said, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>Hotaru did so and the moment in came in contact with the shard , a purple ring appearing into her hand. "I can't believe it, it is a mini upgrade ring" Tails said. "I'm going to use it." Hotaru said as she tapped into the upgrade ring and watched as her transformation pen changed in a flare of purple. It no long looked like a pen but a pair of metal bracelets, both designed like the alternate form of her chao and possessing the symbol of Saturn. Both had purple glowing gems in the place of eyes. She put on the bracelets and heard as they locked and the breaks in the bracelet faded away.</p><p>"I wonder what's going to happen when I next transform?" Hotaru said, "I feel a source of chaos energy coming from the bracelets." Tails said as he examined her wrist. Hotaru blushed at the way Tails was holding her hands. "So where are we anyway and where are our partners?" Tails pointed behind them and Hotaru turned to see Kit and Violet in there alternate forms following Shade. "The locals told us this was Orochi's forest. Shadow told me of Orochi, its a eight headed dragon that eats humans."</p><p>Hotaru frowned. "Then why are we here?" Tails sighed. "The source of the chaos energy lead into here, I think that the Orochi has some fragments. Also theirs something else." Hotaru got a stinking feeling in her stomach. "What is it" Tails sighed again. "There were descriptions of some of your friends going into the forest, they told the locals of a nearby town that they were going to defeat the Orochi." Hotaru's eyes widened in shock. "They are going to get themselves eaten" She rubbed her forehead to try and get rid of the headache that was developing. "Shade go faster, we need to go, if only to help them not get eaten." Shade complied and with an explosion of the sound barrier being broken, the world turned to a giant smudge of color.</p><p>When Shade finally slowed down. They found themselves deep in the forest, surrounded by signs of a recent fight. Trees have been destroyed, and portions of the ground were brunt or covered in melting ice. Hotaru felt her blood go cold when she saw blotches of blood on the ground. "Oh my god look" Tails said pointing. Hotaru did so and found a figure covered in a black cloak and hood leaning against a tree breathing hard. Hotaru jumped off and ran to the figure immediately. The person was still breathing, but it was impossible to see who is was as their whole body was covered in a black cloak that was closed and covered the person's face all the way up the nose. The head was covered by something resembling a witches hat that concealed the rest of the face of person.</p><p>The figured groaned again and opened their eyes. In fact their red eyes could be seen through the shadows of the hat. Hotaru wasted no time in healing the person and was surprised when it came so much more easier then usual. She didn't even feel tired. Hotaru figured it was from the Upgrade Ring.</p><p>Tails got there next and gasped when he saw those eyes. "Its Rouge" He said. Slightly adjusting the hat, they could see her face more easier, even if it was still mostly concealed. Rouge's return to consciousness came with a major gasp.</p><p>She looked up and saw Tails and Hotaru. "Oh thank god. I'm glad you two are here." She got up and looked surprised. "My leg was broken, what happened." Hotaru smiled, "I healed you" Rouge smiled. "Good girl, but you need to help your fellow senshi" Tails frowned. "What happened?" Rouge began looking around. "I came to town in time to hear a story about how several people proclaimed they were going after the Orochi, and their descriptions matched your friends, so me and Grim ran towards the forest. I caught up in time just to see Orochi attack them. I saved them but it drew the attention of all eight heads. The last thing I remember before darkness is Grim shifting to his alternate form and leading the Orochi away. We need to find him."</p><p>When she finished speaking a big explosion went off in the distance and the ground shook. "GRIM!" Rouge yelled. She jumped onto Shade. "PLEASE GO!" She pleaded. Shade nodded and he went off, followed by Tails and Hotaru who were riding on their partners this time. Shade didn't even bother going around trees. A barrier of wind appeared in front of him and the incoming trees where destroyed by his vacuum blade shaped aura. Hotaru was flying above the trees on Violet while Tails was bouncing from branch to branch on Kit.</p><p>They got to another clearing where they saw the Orochi hissing as it approached its pray. Hotaru gasped when she saw Haruka, Setsuna and Michiru back against a tree. Grim was in a hole in the ground breathing hard. One of his wings were bent at an odd angel and he was covered in black blood. The Orochi didn't get away unharmed either, a couple of the heads where moving slower then the others and one was messing an eye. "Grim!" Rouge jumped off of Shade and began running to Grim, pulling out her Guardian Emerald. Unfortunately that drew the attention of the hurt Orochi to her.</p><p>"Rouge watch out!" Hotaru yelled. She jumped off of Violet and crossed her arms, with her bracelets touching each other. "SATURN CHAOS ACTIVATION!" Her body was concealed by purple energy and the symbol of Saturn appeared in front of her. The other Senshi gasped when Sailor Saturn landed on the ground. Her fuku looked the same only on her chest was something resembling a star shaped Guardian Emerald and other little changes. Her tiara was solid purple crystal instead of gold and skirt went down to her knees so she wouldn't flash everyone every time she fell. Her metal boots had grown past her knees and her metal gloves fully incased her arms. The biggest change was the fact that two giant purple wings had grown out her back that had black tips and the Silence Glaive. The blade was longer, the handle a little thicker and around where her hands usually are where hand guards.</p><p>"YOU LEAVE HER ALONE" Hotaru yelled. The Orochi turned to the direction of her voice and hissed before rushing at her and slamming painfully into her silence wall. It tried again, but Hotaru held it with no effort. In fact, because of the upgrade ring, Saturn had an easier time controlling her powers. Tails didn't realize this and got mad when he saw Hotaru in trouble. "You bastard!" He pulled out his Hikari-Z34100 series gun and set it to full power on bazooka mode. The gun transformed with it becoming long and the barrel widening and with a pull of the trigger, launched a massive blast towards the unsuspecting Orochi. It howled in pain as half of one of it's heads where blown off.</p><p>Tails put the smoking barrel down as he ran to Hotaru. "Are you okay?" He asked. Hotaru nodded. "Yes, I could have held it you know" He blushed and twiddled his thumbs. "Oh, I just well thought that you were in trouble because you told me you had trouble controlling your powers sometime and I had to help you out." Hotaru giggled. "You're so sweet" Tails blushed at this before Hotaru moved him aside. "Silence Wall!" She whispered as the Orochi slammed into her barrier again. The damage Tails done to it's head was gone, the Orochi somehow regrowing the chunk of its head missing.</p><p>It tried slamming into it again, when something massive slammed into it. It was Shade, who had opted to shift into his Dragon form for the ability of flight. What followed was a massive fight between the two massive beast. Shade roared as he fired his massive energy blast towards the Orochi, but the seven heads arranged himself in a geometric shape and formed an energy barrier that blocked the blast, but it did push it back. The eighth and biggest head whipped around and try to bite Shade, but the dragon fly up into the air and let lose and even bigger blast of energy, one of likes that people never seen Shade make.</p><p>One of the heads of the Orochi moved and took the blast for the main head, completely being blown off, but it had signs of regenerating again, only slower. While Shade was fighting the Orochi, Hotaru and Tails ran to where Grim was being checked on by Rouge. "Is he okay?" Tails asked. Rouge looked up through teary eyes. "I don't know, he's breathing is all wrong" Grim lefted a trembling claw and wiped the tears off of Rouge, growling in sympathy. Hotaru got on her knees facing Grim. "I don't know if my powers will work on Grim, but I'll try" She held her hands over his broken body and his body was incased in a purple glow.</p><p>They watched as the black blood went back into his body before the wounds sealed with undamaged skin. Grim grunted in pain as his wing healed and arm fixed itself. Grim got up and stretched his wings. "You did it" Rouge said. Tails looked confused. "How did Grim shift without the Guardian emerald?" Rouge smiled at Grim. "He saw I was in trouble and forced the transformation, but he didn't have enough energy to fully fight" She handed him the emerald and he took it in. A black aura surrounded him as he grew to twice his size. Grim roared before going into the fight between Shade and the Orochi.</p><p>Shade had fired another blast at the head that grew back again but Grim blurred and the black aura shaped into a blade of short. Grim slammed into the Orochi's center, pushing it so Shade's blast would slam right into the main head. The Orochi roared in pain as the damage was transferred to the smaller heads. Shade took advantage of the Orochi's distraction by ripping into the throat of one of the smaller heads. A shower of red blood cover Shade as he bit deeper into the struggling head. Grim came to that head and slashed with its deadly claws into the other side of the neck which caused a shower of blood to cover him too.</p><p>Hotaru ran to her friends. "Are you okay" They nodded. "Then come on we need to drive the Orochi off, its keeps on regenerating for some reason." Haruka, Michiru and Setsuna nodded, but a stunned Setsuna said. "Hotaru, that transformation...You never had one like that in the past"</p><p>Hotaru smiled. "Its the chaos energy I'm tapping into. You'll see that it can help us, rather than the order based energy. I'm sure all the Senshi can get a next level transformation." She turned and raised her glaive. "It's time to end this"</p><p>Shade and Grim saw this and released the wounded Orochi. A purple aura surrounded Hotaru and she yelled "CHAOTIC SILENCE SURPRISE!" and released her attack. Haruka, Michiru and Setsuna were nearly blown off their feet by the advance version of the Silent Glaive Surprise. Pure destruction ran in the direction of the Orochi and then the Orochi itself was consumed by the wave of energy. The last thing they saw before the Orochi was blown away was the seven lesser heads blowing up.</p><p>"Wow" Haruka said. Michiru and Setsuna couldn't say anything as they were stunned at the intensity of the attack their fellow Senshi just did. "Is the Orochi...?" Hotaru shook her head and Setsuna's question. "It was blown all the way across the forest, as a last minute defense by it. It'll take a long time before it'll heal" Tails came up holding eight shards. "Even longer without these chaos fragments. And even then it won't be as powerful as it was." Hotaru sagged in relief, really tired from releasing that new attack. Tails walked over and supported her with his arm. She smiled gratefully as she leaned into him. Rouge grinned. "Aw, how cute!" The other three women laughed when Hotaru and Tails went beet red.</p><p>Three men were walking down a single road. One dressed like a monk, one a mix between samurai and lord and another dressed in a futuristic outfit. "It's been a while, how many chaos fragments do we have" Said the one in the futuristic outfit. The one dressed like monk grinned. "We have about eighteen fragments, six between each of us, Vash" Vash grinned. "I have to say, the way you get rid of demons is unique, Alucard" The monk chuckled. "It let me see the sun again without any filters. It's been ages sense I just looked up in the sky at the sun" The third stayed silent as he looked ahead. Vash noticed this. "Shadow what's wrong, you're quiet" Alucard nodded. "I haven't heard a peep from you"</p><p>Shadow looked at them and shrugged. "Its nothing, I'm just waiting for what's following us to come out into the open" Both nodded. "So you sensed it to" Vash said. Alucard shrugged. "It is a little annoying, whoever it is has been following us sense we left the last village and doesn't have the decency to greet us." Shadow chuckled. "I know, so you guys do know where we are headed?" The nodded. "You have to head back to the northern lands." Vash said. Shadow nodded. "It seems that all the leaders of the Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western lands are going to meet for something very important."</p><p>All three stopped suddenly when the source of the energy spying on them got closer then its ever been. "Vash how are you weapons working now that you got those upgrade rings" Shadow asked pulled out Shade's Wrath. Alucard simply cracked his neck as his spun his rod. Vash grinned as he pulled out his two guns. Days ago he had found two upgrade rings and both guns had been upgraded. Both were now twice as long and futuristic looking. The barrels had gotten long and more cylinder like, between the barrel and the chamber was a crystal area. One the silver gun it was black and on the black gun it was silver. Because of the upgrade rings, they actually matched his futuristic outfit.</p><p>"The thing is, it lets me use bullets still and you know about the angelarms" Shadow nodded. "Well, for some reason the upgrade allows me to use a weaker version on it without transforming the guns, allowing me to fire energy attacks, and I found out depending on the bullets I enter, they use different energy attacks."</p><p>Shadow nodded, all three were surprised when Vash accidentally triggered the energy attacks fighting a demon. "So what you call them" Vash grinned as he adjusted his shades. "I'm going to call them Angelic Casters, or Casters for short." Shadow nodded as he triggered Shade's Wrath into its fang mode. "Nice name, heads up" Something jumped down that only one of the three recognized. "Naraku" Shadow said.</p><p>The person was cloaked in baboon fur but one could feel the raw malice he had for them. "Shadow, I think its about time you lend me your services in capturing the Shikon Shards" Shadow laughed. "Let me guess. You tried collecting pieces but found that certain people are getting to them first" Naraku glared and his eyes glowed for a moment. "You knew when you respread them all over. That they were going to come" Shadow shrugged. "You never asked, shows how smart you were. Did you honestly think that I was going to let you get your filthy hands on a power like that. You must think me mad or something."</p><p>Naraku clenched his fist so hard black blood began to leak out his fist. "I shall make you pay a hundred times over for this insult." Shadow chuckled again and smirked, causing Naraku to loudly grind his teeth. "Tell me, did three women last defeat you and take your portions of the Shikon no Tama? I can feel their residual traces of aura on you. They must have kicked your ass real good." It is a testament to Shadow's ability to piss his enemies off because Naraku growled and dozens of tentacles replaced his legs and a bunch of demons came out the sky. "I will kill you."</p><p>Shadow's grin went from ear to ear. "Oh did I strike a nerve, Hanyou Naraku" That was all it took because Naraku screamed in rage and charged stupidly at the three men with his demons trailing behind him. Shadow jumped into the air while Vash ran to the right and Alucard to the left. "Try #2" Vash said as he loaded his guns and pulled the trigger. A ball of pure red energy went out his guns before forming into twin dragons that actually roared. They came in contact with the demon bees and easily vaporized them with some of the demons using them as protection.</p><p>Alucard chuckled when he found himself surrounded on all sides by demons of all sorts. One of the more cockier ones laughed when they saw him. "Look boys, its a monk. A pretty weak looking one at that. What are you going to do, pray?" Alucard just kept chuckling and that unnerved some of them. The one the spoke earlier decided to pick Alucard up and get right in his face. "What's so funny, monk. Gone mad in the fact you're about to die?" Alucard stopped chuckling and the demon grew nervous at the serious expression on his face. Alucard leaned towards the demons face. "I'm not a monk" Then the monk's head morphed to that of his demon dog familiar and bit the demon's head off. The now headless demon let go of Alucard and fell to the ground in a twitching heap. The demon dog head spat out the demons head and it morphed back to Alucard's normal appearance.</p><p>All the other demons backed up a little bit in fear, but Alucard looked at them two. "No point in trying to escape, you were dead when I saw you." Alucard tapped the ground three times and a wave of dark energy went out in every direction. The demons scream as they were trapped in his aura. Alucard tapped the ground three more times and the aura full of demons returned to him and was absorbed into his bodies. "First there were screams and then only silence, and the silence was good" Alucard said chuckling afterwards.</p><p>Shadow dodged another one of Naraku's tentacles. "Your forces have been defeated, easily. So Hanyou Naraku, what now" Naraku didn't say anything only sent more tentacles in hopes of catching Shadow, but he just avoided them with a smirk. "Nice try" Shadow said as he slashed one of the tentacles. It turned to stone and shattered. "How many curses can I give you before you body is destroyed?" Shadow asked as he slashed another one which suddenly stopped as if frozen in time. "Why won't you die" Naraku asked as another tentacle suddenly rotted away after Shadow slashed it.</p><p>"To boring." Shadow replied as another of Naraku's appendages, started to attack blindly, even striking it's master. "I always wonder why people ask me to die when they can't kill me, I think its a little rude." Shadow said, somewhat ignoring Naraku. He tried taking advantage of this by sending all of his tentacles at once. "Oh I guess you want me to fight instead of thinking out loud. Okay. LIGHT SPEED SLASH!" Several rings formed around Shade's Wrath and Shadow's arms blurred to the point of them turning invisible right before the tentacles hit. All of them twitched before falling into tiny little pieces. "Next time Hanyou Naraku, don't send one of your little puppets." Shadow said before the rest of the puppet Naraku sent fell in pieces.</p><p>The three men sat down underneath a tree. "You can never find any good villains now an days." Shadow said. Both nodded. "So to the north?"</p><p>He then asked. Both grinned. "To the north!"</p><p>Read and Review.</p><p>A/N: I guess I do have something to say. Vash's upgraded weapon is the Casters Gene Starwing uses in Outlaw Star. The part about Naraku being Hanyou is a bit of a spoiler is really in the series. Oh and can you guess who the Werewolf is? What is Kikyo's part in all this and what the hell happened to Big?</p>
