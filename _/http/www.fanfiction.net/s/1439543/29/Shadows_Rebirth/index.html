</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth</p><p>A/N: Thanks for reading</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>What?</p><p>Chapter 25: What lays beneath those eyes</p><p>Present Day: England</p><p>In front of a classily made castle, there were guards everywhere. Even more so then usual. Ever since news of the U.S president's murder, the world has been in an uproar. Some countries are blaming others, while others deny any and all involvement. What is worse is that there was no evidence left behind by the killer other then the dead cooling bodies. Every country was quickly becoming xenophobic. The people want someone to blame. It has gotten so bad that everyone started to close their borders.</p><p>It was a foggy morning. One couldn't see a foot past their hands. Guards watched stoically in every direction. They were the English, let the assassin come, they could take them all. No one would dare attack. That brought hidden smiles to the guards as they remembered the Queen's words of encouragement in this time of worry.</p><p>In the fog, approaching the castle was a lone figure. He had spiky ivory white hair, his lower face was covered by a demonic looking mask. He felt no need to wear a disguise like his counterpart. A simple long sleeve white jacket with the tails hanging to his knees and tights for his lower body. Decorated down his arms where spikes and sprouting from his head were three black horns. The person smirked underneath his mask as he lifted his weapon. A long silver board sword with a black streak in the middle. At the base of the hilt the blade widened into a circular shape.</p><p>He stood within the fog and watched to castle. "For the glory of the empire." The fog suddenly thickened and his form was gone. All around the castle the fog thickened. Soon the guards, couldn't even see a couple of millimeters in front of them. It was like they were surrounded by a cloud. Then it started. One guard had left to relieve another of their post. He turned a corner and was promptly decapitated. The blood flew out the neck; in fact it seemed all the blood in the body was sucked out , leaving a withered husk. The fog absorbed the blood and it briefly turned red in that spot where the guard was killed, but it turned back to pure white again. No one was the wiser of the dead body as the guard didn't have enough time to make a sound.</p><p>Out the body on the ground a white ghost grew out the corpse. Its face was contorted in a silent scream of horror before it to was absorbed by the cloud. Outside the castle, a guard was trying to see in front of him when he suddenly jerked. He looked down and saw a blade coming out his chest. He touched the blade before it jerked out and collapsed to the ground where he died. His body was also turned into a husk as all the blood was taken out via the wound and was absorbed by the wind along with the man's soul. This happened to all the guards outside the fence surrounding the castle and each one didn't get the chance to alert their fellow guards.</p><p>In front of the main entrance of the castle there appeared a brief distortion in the fog, it vanished as the gate opened as if the wind blew it open. The lock was just gone, no traces of it ever being destroyed. The guards near the gate walked closer, to try and see how this happened. One guard bent down to look over the part of the gate where the lock would be. "Hey what do you think about this" He asked his companion.</p><p>All he got was silence. He turned around and saw that the person was gone, and he swore it was his imagination but the fog briefly flashed red. "Strange" A hand appeared out the fog and grabbed his neck, before easily breaking it. The guard fell to the ground with a choked gasp. A small trial of blood escaped his mouth. It was enough as all the blood in his body was taken out via the mouth, after that the man's soul came out the same way. Moments later another withered husk landed on the ground next to the newly made one. Pieces of what used to be an arm broke off and rolled past the opened gate. Again no one was alerted.</p><p>At the entrance to the Castle, a line of guards where standing guard in front of the doors. Each and every one of them felt a strange feeling of danger. It was unfortunately that they didn't listen to that gut instinct that warned them to escape, to run, to live another day. Sad really as each one fell to the ground dead. At first glance, there was nothing wrong, but if you looked closer at their necks, one would fine a thin line of blood where their throats were cut. In fact they looked to be staring out into the fog. That peaceful look didn't last as blood exploded from their thin but fetal wounds as it flowed into the fog followed by their souls moments later.</p><p>A distortion appeared and the husks were blown away with a gentle wind. They didn't land as the corpse disintegrated into small ashes. The distortion formed into the shape of a man, and it walked up to the doors and pulled them open with a creak and it disappeared again as the fog entered the inside of the castle. The fog quickly filled each and every room, causing all the guards to rush towards the main door as to search for the reasons the fog drifted inside.</p><p>They found nothing, but an open door and so they closed it and with that single action sealed their faith. As the moment the door closed, on the outside the whole castle was covered in a thin layer of ice that was diamond hard. With the fog concealing everything, no one would realize what happened. By the time the fog finally disappears, the ice would have melted and evaporated...but that is after the fact.</p><p>The group of guards inside the castle split up to leave back towards their post. One of which was next to a case of the royal jewels. The guard turned to look at the fine jewelry and blinked in shock as it disappeared in thin air. He was about to say something when a hand covered his mouth and a blade entered from the back of his neck and out his throat, ending his life and his attempts to scream. The hand went down the mans jaw, almost caressing it, and went to the throat where the corpses blood and soul was absorbed through a small funnel that went through the hand. The hand faded away into the fog again as the killer worked there way to the throne room. The only sound heard, was that of a set of grandfather clocks all ringing the same time.</p><p>Each time a clock would ring an guard would find themselves pinned to the wall via a massive white blade through the chest. Their dying breaths, pleas for mercy and last prayers were not heard due to the echoing ringing of the clocks. Their blood didn't even had time to stain the walls before it was absorbed into the fog along with the essences of the men slain. By now, the guards were nervous as none of their allies had answered their hail and not even a peep was heard.</p><p>Soon there were only the guards in front of the throne room. All the others have been messily but silently slain. The large castle felt even more imposing with the absence of life in it. Even if the guards still alive didn't know that they were alone, they still felt that emptiness in the castle. That feeling would last too long as the fog suddenly shifted. When it did, all the men guarding fell apart into pieces. Again the process of the blood flowed into the fog, making it flash red again before turning normal. After their blood was drained, so were their souls. The fog shifted back, turning the husks into ash from the force of the shift.</p><p>A distortion appeared before the doors, like last time it was in the shape of a man. The man shaped distortion in the fog walked up to the doors and opened them before walking it, the fog didn't follow though and that revealed the man from before. The queen gasped when he walked in and before she could reach the emergency phone, a pole pierced in and shattered the phone into pieces. Attached to the pole was the flag of England. "Wh-wh-who are you" The person chuckled as he approached the queen. "For the glory of the empire, I am the revolution of death. I am White Cloud" Was all he said as he approached the queen. She gave one scream before she died, but no one else was there to hear her.</p><p>A servant found the queen an hour later. She was still in the throne, in fact she was dressed in the royal jewels, but the big thing was that she was impaled by the pole wielding the flag of England. Written on the ceiling above in big blood red letters was the mocking phrase of "Long live the Queen."</p><p>Back in the fedual age, it was quiet as it was nighttime. Amy was sleeping in her room. But that isn't what's important. Amy was dreaming, and it was quite real. "Shadow...no...don't" She murmured as she dreamed. One would have to go deeper to see what going on. It was nighttime and Amy was running towards a wounded Shadow. His clothes were in tatters and only his pants were on, so one could see his bare chest. Normally this would fluster Amy, but not now for Shadow was covered in numerous wounds. He stood with one hand in the air, with his palm pointing towards the nighttime sky.</p><p>"Shadow! DON'T!" She screamed as she tried to run faster, but she was tired and her body couldn't handle anymore energy without killing her. Even with her impressive speed it wasn't enough. "I'm sorry Amy, I have to do this" Shadow said sadly. Amy found herself collapsing to the floor as her body would no longer work. She looked at Sonic in horror as he did this to her. "He's got to do this" Sonic said as he lifted her up and began to run in the other direction. "Thanks Sonic." Shadow said. Sonic turned and nodded before running off with the paralyzed Amy. "Sorry about this" Shadow murmured to Amy before a massive black and red glow surrounded his body. "CHAOTIC" The glow increased a thousand fold as Shadow began tapping into the Chaos Emerald. He changed straight to his mega form, not even going hyper as the energy running through him kept increasing.</p><p>Wings sprouted on his back and spread out fully. His wings had an unnatural wing span of a good forty feet. What followed was a beautiful scene as his wings glowed black and red as they changed from feathers to pure glowing energy. Above Shadow a globe of black and red swirling energy appeared. It quickly expanded and everyone's breath caught in seeing it. It was the size of a small moon and Shadow was holding it with one hand. "REVOLUTION!" He screamed as his attack launched into the air a the speed of sound. It was so powerful a huge crater was formed as the attack forced Shadow into the ground. The sky even turned black because of the leakage of his attack as it escaped orbit. Shadow didn't stop there even though he looked ready to collapse.</p><p>"CHAOTIC REVOLUTION!" Again he pumped out another one, "CHAOTIC REVOLUTION!" and another, "CHAOTIC REVOLUTION!" He collapsed to one knee as he kept on firing the massive attack out the atmosphere. "CHAOTIC REVOLUTION" With a strength of will that all knew him for, Shadow stood back up and kept on firing the moon size attacks. "CHAOTIC REVOLUTION!" It seemed that was his limit as the minute Shadow launched that attack, he fell to both knees and turned back to normal as his body couldn't use anymore chaos energy from the Chaos Emerald. He looked up into the sky and smiled as his attacks were on target before falling backwards and passing out. A flare of energy surrounded Shadow and he was gone.</p><p>"SHADOW!" Amy screamed as she woke up from her sleep. She stared up into the ceiling after she eventually calmed down. Outside, Lara and Usagi were asking to be let in, but she didn't get out of bed. Her heart was beating to fast and her tears were flowing too hard. "It was a dream right?" She asked herself. "That has to be a dream. It-it-it can't be real." She eventually settled down, but was still staring at the ceiling. "Its just a dream, please let it be a dream." Sleep did not come that night.</p><p>Big grinned as he cast his rod back into the river. "Good fishing" he muttered. Next to him wearing similar fishing outfits, where Minako and Motoko. They sighed as they followed his actions and went fishing. "Why couldn't we end up with Mousse?" Minako whined. "Or Sonic, or Ericks?" Matoko added. Big wasn't ugly to say, he just didn't have the body frame that Minako and Motoko liked. They dared not say it, because it would make them look very shallow.</p><p>"Come on girls. I can tell you two are having fun, so get rid of those sad faces." Big said as he removed the largest fish either girls ever seen from his hook. He shook the fish off and both were surprised when another chaos fragment came out its mouth. No matter where Big was fishing, he would come across chaos fragments and the occasional Upgrade Ring. Rather then use the Upgrade Rings, he just put them away in subspace. Also the fact is, he was right. They were having a lot of fun with the challenge of fishing and Big was being very nice as he taught them how. Had he had the looks of the type of guys they liked, they would be all over him.</p><p>They were pulling in their fish, small, but pretty good for amateurs when a voice came from behind them. "Fishermen, great. This should be easy." They turned and saw a man in a baboon disguise as he approached them menacingly. "I suggest you give me all your jewel shards. If you do, I'll make your deaths painless.</p><p>At the inn, Hotaru and Tails finally recovered from their 'talk' Tails was still beat red while Hotaru was still flushed. "You know I'm worried." She said. Tails blinked. "About what?" She sighed. "Big, he's just a defenseless fisherman. How could he protect himself from all the youkai out there?" She watched as Tails fell to the ground clutching his stomach as he laughed very hard. "Big? Defenseless? That has to be the funniest thing I ever heard."</p><p>Minako and Matoko stood up and pulled out their transformation wands, preparing to fight to the bitter end, when they felt strong but very gentle hands on their shoulders. They looked up to see Big standing behind them. "Go back to fishing, your bait is going to be lost." They nodded, unsure and watched as Big went back to fishing. A vein grew on Naraku's head as he was ignored. "You idiot! You shall die for dismissing me like that!" With that, he sent out a blast. In his rage, it missed Big but burnt his latest catch into ashes.</p><p>"How is it funny" Hotaru asked. She was slightly upset that he was laughing at her, but not enough that she would pull out her glaive and rip him a new one. Tails gulped seeing her weapon appear in thin air and was surrounded by a dark purple glow. He got the clue and stopped laughing. "Big is the strongest man on earth" She blinked in confusion. "What?" Tails nodded. "He's even stronger then Knuckles. It's just that he's a pacifist. He won't fight unless you cross that line" Hotaru nodded. "What's that line?"</p><p>Big calmly put down his pole and stood up, not facing Naraku and his youkai army. "You destroyed my fish" He said as he took of his fishermen's hat and vest leaving him in a long sleeved purple shirt with black horizontal stripes. "You insulted my life and tainted this fine day of fishing and for that I can never forgive." He turned around and everyone could see his eyes glowing as an evil smirk appeared on his face. One of the youkai, becoming impatient charged at Big. Big pulled back his arm and let lose one hell of a punch. When it connected, there was a slight distortion in the air surrounding the Youkai and Big's fist.</p><p>Seconds later, everyone could hear every single bone in the youkai's body turn to powder. The youkai's body rippled around the point of impact and was sent flying for the horizon, in pieces no bigger then a coin. All this happened in .5 seconds. Afterwards, there was absolute silence that was broken when Minako and Motoko both said. "DDDAAAMMMNNN!"</p><p>"Never get between Big and his fishing. Sonic did one time and we found him several months later half-way across the world on a desert island still tending to his wounds." Hotaru nodded, kind of dumbstruck that the gentle Big could hold so much power. "Oh don't let me get started on the time Knuckles accidentally destroyed his catch of the day" Tails shuddered</p><p>Several youkai, showing that they weren't the mindless minions people usually thought them to be ran away. Big turned towards Naraku and the group. "You brought them here" Big said pointing at Naraku. "You will be the one to pay" Big said as he charged, showing that his massive size didn't mean he was slow. While Big wasn't as fast as Knuckles, he had the god-like levels of endurance and strength to make up for it.</p><p>The group of youkai, seeking to protect their master, all charged at Big. He ran through them as if he was made of paper. He swung another punch, this time at a group. His fist connected with one and like previously, a disortion in the air appeared and the broken demons were sent flying. One tried to stab Big in the back with its dagger like claws, only to watch its claw shatter into tiny pieces and Big to turn around a lay a massive headbutt on the youkai's head. Its head could not withstand the strain and was turned into a cloud of blood and tiny pieces of flesh.</p><p>Big didn't stop with his motion. He just rolled with his headbutt and did a frontflip that ended with both his feet planting into the skulls of two Youkai. Like with his hands, his feet caused distortions to appear along with massive spiderweb like cracks running through the ground. Big jumped again using the youkai as footholds and jumped again. He didn't really jump no more then six feet, but when he landed, the earth shook and knocked several more off their feet.</p><p>Big used the time to reach into his pocket and pull out a massive double headed ax that was easily bigger then his massive body.</p><p>It was solid steel and looked like it weighed several tons. Big held it with one hand easily. Big turned and his weapon followed him. With his turn numerous demons were cut into segments like a hot knife through butter.</p><p>Another group charged at Big, who in response slammed his free hand into the ground. A huge chasm sprung from his ground and a massive hole appeared underneath the group of youkai, causing them to fall in. Big turned to a nearby tree, his axe cut through the tree easily. As the tree fell, he pulled back and hit the tree. Another distortion appeared and the tree rippled before exploding into hundreds of stakes that impaled the Youkai, many of which stakes pierced brains or hearts.</p><p>Within the ten minutes Big started to fight, he reduced Naraku's supporters to just one-forth of their original size. The last forth was easily taken cared of when Big tossed his axe with both hands. The spinning axe went through the last group of youkai despite there attempts to defend. The axe, acting like a boomerang, cut through them again at another angle before Big caught his weapon with one hand. Naraku was all alone now, but he didn't even looked phased by what he just seen...even though internally he was shitting bricks.</p><p>Big turned towards Naraku. "Now for you" Naraku did the wise thing and summoned a cloud of his miasma to escape...or would have had Big not snatched him out the cloud, unharmed from the poisons. "I eat puffer fish raw, you think this cloud of insect killer can hurt me?" Big said as he chocked the now nervous Naraku with one hand. Big dropped his axe, causing the earth to shake again from the impact and pulled back a fist. "Now this is really going to hurt."</p><p>With that Big unleashed a massive punch right into Naraku's gut. The baboon fur was shredded away from the distortion caused by the punch. Naraku's body rippled as he folded over Big's large fist. Big grinned evilly as he pulled back again and punched again in the same spot.</p><p>This time most of Naraku's top was completely shredded, causing his spider shaped burn mark to be shown. It turned out Naraku actually showed up in person, not bothering to send a puppet as he greatly, greatly underestimated Big. Another hit and the spider burn mark rippled differently as patches of Naraku's flesh was destroyed. His body didn't get enough time to settle when Big unleashed another punch this one ten times harder.</p><p>Naraku was hit so hard, both Minako and Matoko could see Big's fist outlined out of Naraku's back. Naraku's eyes crossed as black blood trailed out his mouth as something within him 'unsettled' He tried to struggle out of Big's unbreakable grip. That stopped when Big hit him again in the same spot as all the last times he was hitting. This time both of the Senshi could see Big's fist stretch out Naraku's body, not breaking flesh but doing a hell of a lot of damage to his insides. In Naraku, the 'unsettled' feeling reached its peak.</p><p>As if sensing it. Big dropped Naraku onto the floor and stepped back. Naraku stumbled back, clutching his stomach as something started to come up. Naraku's eyes widen and blood leaked out his eyes as his jaws stretched and he expelled something out. It was a naked little girl with ivory white hair and very, very pale skin. In her hands, she was clutching a mirror to her chest as she rolled into the fetal position and began to cry.</p><p>Naraku stumbled back as the 'unsettled' feeling wasn't done. He watched in horror as a hand reached out his mouth and tried to force its way out. Soon another hand came out and forced Naraku's jaws even wider. The senshi had to turn away at this point for whatever was trying to escaped was pulling Naraku's jaws about ten feet apart. His face looked almost comical as it was stretched that far. It was a miracle that his lower jaw just didn't rip off when the figure stepped out of Naraku.</p><p>Where the little girl was naked, this man was dressed like a bandit. He resembled Naraku, only his face was more rugged and didn't have the feminine tones to it that Naraku had. On Naraku's back, the spider shaped burn mark faded away. The man looked up into the sky and down into his hands. "I'm free?" He shuddered in joy. "I'M FREE!" He screamed into the sky as his eyes rolled back into his skull and fainted.</p><p>Naraku groaned on the ground, too out of it to stand after experiencing that. Big walked over and picked up the downed demon. "Now don't let me see you again." With that Big dropped kicked Naraku into the air. When Naraku hit the apex of the kick, he summoned his cloud of miasma and retreated. It was noticeably much weaker then the last time he summoned it. Big clapped his hands as to get rid of dust. Big then bent down and picked the shivering little girl into his arms. "Now what to do with you two" He said as he looked at the unconcious man as Minako and Matoko looked at him in awe.</p><p>Shadow grinned as he looked into the mirror. Shade was sleeping, trying to regain the energy lost from going through so many variations of his cat body. He finally attained the form where he could obtain maximum speed and control. He had also gone through a transformation as well.</p><p>His whole body was covered in a thin layer of fur and his hair was as sharp as his weapon. His eyes were also more silted. Shadow concentrated as he switched back on forth form this stage to human and back again. "This is very cool" He muttered as he grew fur again before turning it back. He had also found that this new stage allowed him to be ten times faster and he found that his reserves where even deeper then before, he could handle more chaos energy without damaging his body.</p><p>"Come on Shade wake up! We have to get going!" Shade grumbled but got to his feet. "Since I'm the leader of the Northern Lands, try not to go into your dragon mode, I heard the Lord of the Southern lands is a dragon taiyoukai and it'll be unusual for a cat taiyoukai to have a dragon for a partner." Shade nodded in agreement. "I understand, but if the situation needs it as an emergency then I'll use it." He said, not even opening his eyes to look at Shadow.</p><p>Shadow shrugged. "Then that's all I can ask for. Now lets find Vash, Alucard and the others and get ready to go." Shadow put his things away into subspace before leaving his temperory room. Behind him, Shade was following. Shadow went left to knock on the room Vash was staying in. He got no response. He shrugged and walked in. "Oh my" Came out his mouth at what he saw. He craned his head to the left, then to the right. "I didn't know one could bend that way" Shadow muttered.</p><p>Setsuna blushed and tried to untie herself from the ceiling, below her, Vash was wrapped up in the blanket sleeping like a baby. "Shut up" Shade walked in and whistled. "That's pretty impressive. You must do Yoga, or that would be very uncomfortable." Setsuna's flush grew deeper. It didn't help when Haruka and Michiru walked in behind Shadow. "Wow. You should have him give you lessons Michiru" Haruka muttered, but everyone had heard her. Shadow and Shade both took a step away from Haruka as Michiru blushed beet red while Setsuna boggled. Vash, showing he wasn't asleep either, flushed as well.</p><p>"I'm not even going to ask" Shadow said as he and Shade left the room, followed by Haruka and Michiru after they untied Setsuna. What the Senshi of Pluto didn't realize was that they had took pictures and the two were going off to 'discuss' them. Setsuna glared at Vash, who was still wrapped in the blanket. "Do you mind?" Vash asked. Setsuna blinked before Vash sighed. "I need to get dressed" She flushed but put on a silly grin. "No, I want to see you" Vash sighed. "Are you sure you want to?"</p><p>Setsuna nodded, "I think I deserve to see after being tied up at nighttime." Vash shrugged. "No means no." She blushed again, but stayed in the room. "Fine, but I'm going to kick you out if you dare show any pity or any of those type of emotions." Vash took off the blanket and Setsuna had to hold in a gasp. There were scars everywhere, his arms, his neck, his torso. He had pants on, but she was pretty sure that he would have scars underneath them to. He had patches of what resembled a steel grate on parts of his body, and his arm. It looked metal and was wrapped in leather. Then she realized that it was a robotic arm.</p><p>Vash did not shrink underneath her stunned expression, no he stood proud. "I am Vash the Stampede" He simply said as he began dressing. Setsuna was still speechless. Vash finished getting dressed and placed both guns in their hostlers. He spared a glanced at the stunned Senshi and walked out the room. Behind him floated his partner, Wormwood. He didn't have the heart to use the original name of the dear friend that he lost. In the room, Setsuna collapsed to her knees, she just realized that she hurt his feelings in the time where she froze. She looked at the door he exited and muttered. "I'm sorry"</p><p>Shadow shook his head as he watched her out the window. "She should have said something." He sighed as he hopped off the ledge, and landed on the ground in front of the building just in time for Vash to come out. He had his usual dopey smile on his face, but in his eyes one could see a twinge of hurt. Behind him came Alucard, he was rubbing his forehead as he proved that yes vampires can get hangovers.</p><p>It was a quiet morning and frankly that made Shadow nervous. Something was about to happen. A gust of wind appeared and in front of him was a wolf youkai. He had various parts wrapped in bandages. "You" He said smirking as he pointed at Shadow. Shadow cocked an eyebrow. "What do you want, Kouga?" Kouga glared. "You have a choice." He held up a globe, with a flare of energy a screen appeared out of nowhere</p><p>It was showing three scenes. One was Shadow's house, where Rin was playing with her pet while several cat youkai watched her, another was Usagi, Lara and Amy as they headed for the next town and the last one was of Mousse, Ami and Rei as they helped tend to Kikyo's wounds.</p><p>Shadow stayed claim. "Okay what is this all about wolfboy?" Kouga smirked. "I have a thousand demons at each of this places waiting to ambush them. You have a decision to make" He held out a finger. "One you can give me all the Shikon Shards you have, Two, you can attempt to rescue them, but I'm pretty sure that you can only get to one while the rest will suffer, or Three, they all die. Make your choice" Shadow lost the claim expression. "You son of a bitch" He muttered. Kouga's smirk only widened...only to be wiped out when Vash slammed the butt of one of his guns into the back of his head.</p><p>Shadow glared and Kouga's down form. "You're going to pay for this" He said plainly. Shadow then turned to Shade. "Get to Mousse, I'll go after Amy, Usagi and Lara" As Kouga fell a bright yellow flare shot out his body. "Chaos Control" Shadow said before the flare could launch into the sky, but a distortion happened where that it started going up into the sky, only much, much slower. Almost immediately, Shadow ran in one direction while Shade headed for the other.</p><p>Shade looked back briefly, he had locked on to the flare; at its rate even slowed down, it would alert the others. Shadow had already given him the directions to the house he built. He was not going to let a little girl get killed like that. Both he and Shadow had a fondness for them that came from raising Maria. He and Shadow also both knew that he was going after Rin rather then Mousse and the other Senshi. He promised to get that bastard wolf back when this was over. He was already in his form for maximum speed but he need to go faster.</p><p>The flare was still going up and at the rate he was going he wasn't going to get there in time. The only way he could get there was if he used the Light Speed Dash, but he can't do that. That was when it came to him. He's connected to Shadow on many different levels, why couldn't he use it? Shade muttered a small prayer and concentrated his energies on the Guardian Emerald. He grinned when a line of brightly glowing golden rings appeared in front of him. He passed through the first ring and the world blurred. Unknown to Shade that when he tapped into the Guardian Emerald, the red of his crystal fur began glowing brightly as his aura rose off of him in streams.</p><p>He stopped the light speed dash when he appeared in the valley where Shadow built his home. He could sense Rin and the cat youkai guarding her inside his house, but he could also sense the wolf youkai surrounding the valley. How did Kouga get so many to follow him? It didn't matter to Shade because they were all going to die. Going further with his connection he tapped more energy from the Guardian Emerald as more energy drifted off Shade's body. Shade's grin grew feral as he whispered "Chaos Control"</p><p>They didn't even have time to scream when the froze. To Shade, they were frozen in place as he decimated their ranks, but to them, many of them were just dropping dead in explosions of gore. Many would scream when limbs would suddenly detach or heads would be crushed. Some would just drop dead to the ground with throats ripped out or with their heads turned 180 degrees. Corpses and some still alive would spontaneously combust in a black and red burst of flame. At some intervals, there would be a ghostly appearance of Shade's tiger form, but it would only be brief before it disappeared again.</p><p>It was fast, it was bloody, it was brutal. In the very center of the slaughter, Shade appeared, his muzzle covered with blood as he roared into the sky, proclaiming his victory to all but those still inside the house unaware of what they just missed. Shade turned in a circle as his aura burned away all the dead into nothing but ashes. A pathway of rings formed and Shade was gone.</p><p>Shadow ran, as fast as he could. Due to the Chaos Emerald, he no longer lost energy to the Light Speed Sprint. Any energy he lost would instantly be replaced by the Chaos Emerald. So he ran along a pathway of black and red massive rings in a straight line. It didn't matter that at times he was running along rivers or in thin air. He ran straight, as he couldn't...wouldn't slow down even a bit. He was going to kill all those wolf youkai, it doesn't matter what they try, they will die.</p><p>Yes, they were all going to die, he thought. Especially with his fang ready for use. The claw would work, but the fang would show his feelings at the threat. With that thought, he took out Shade's Wrath while he was still running. It was in its default mode, a gleaming katana. He grinned as he trigger the transformation. It flared black and red as it changed. It grew to five feet, just a little bit shorter then the claw mode but the blade was very, very wide. Like the claw mode, it had a black blade and handle, but around the hilt was red fur.</p><p>All in all, it looked like the Tetsusaiga. Shadow watched as the very air was cut around it as he ran. His grin also turned feral. He had a little further to go then Shade, but he'll get there just in time. Through their connection he knew that Shade was going after Rin first, so he told Shade when he finished up to go to Mousse and help them fight the wolves off. The flare was still going up, still slow but its getting up there, so Shadow decided to give himself so more time. "CHAOS CONTROL" The world froze as he ran using the Light Speed Sprint. It was still a blur, but around him were stationary blurs. But with Chaos Control fueled by more power the flare stopped traveling up into the sky.</p><p>"I'm going to have to find out what the hell that thing is if it can resist Chaos Control" Shadow said to himself as he ran through the last portions of the rings. Shade's Wrath was whistling as it cut through the air. He appeared in thin air in front of the three women surprising them greatly. "Shadow?" Amy said, looking very, very happy to see him, before she or the other two could do anything. "Get down" Shadow yelled as a thousand or so Wolf Youkai began to run out the woods. They did so and a cloud of energy surrounded the blade of Shade's Wrath. Shadow's eyes changed where the pupils became cat like slits.</p><p>Surrounding the approaching army was a cloud of youki as their combined energies made a massive bonfire. Shadow grinned as he saw youki raise off his blade and began to swirl around the enemies energies. "Die" He said as he swing down. When that happen, a massive burst of black energy sprung out the blade and rushed forward the wolf Youkai. In an instant a hundred of them exploded in gore as the energy diced through them. On the ground in front of Shadow were five huge gashes in the earth. Shadow grinned as he twisted his blade and swung again horizontally. "I do believe the attempt to learn the wind scar is a shocking success." He said as another hundred were incinerated.</p><p>By now many of the Wolf Youkai were retreating back into the forest, many of which injured from the energy the bleed off the Wind Scar technique. Shadow swing Shade's Wrath two more times, this time making a x shape version of the wind scar that took out another huge chunk out the retreating army. He smirked as he held the massive weapon over his shoulder and turned to the three women, all of which were blushing heavily.</p><p>"Miss me?" He said smiling before he was glomped by all three, surprising him. Amy was a given to do that and Lara was expected, but Usagi? He wasn't really expect Sailor Moon to fall for him like that. Well he wasn't really complaining as they were laying some pretty great kissing on him. His last coherent thought before he just shrugged and joined in was that he should save them more often.</p><p>Mousse kept on firing from the handcannons on his arm as he took out more and more Wolf Youkai. Again he is so going to thank Tails for the new weapons, as he's barely pushing them back. Behind him, Ami and Rei were protecting Kikyo as they took care of any spare demon that got past him. He frowned when more and more kept coming. At this rate they were going to overwhelm him. Next to him was Ghost as his floating arms wielding sledge hammers was helping protect Mousse from any youkai that got to close to fire on.</p><p>He was about to try and retreat when a totally different Shade appeared with a sonic boom that forced many back, he was breathing hard, but he leapt right in and helped push the Youkai back. "Go protect the women!" Mousse said seeing Shade really tired. He needed a few moments to recover anyway, he figured. Shade nodded and retreated to help protect the others. Mousse smiled before grimacing when one Youkai got through Ghost and knocked his arms up into the air before sending him flying into a nearby tree with a massive kick. Shade was already gone and Ghost was quickly surrounded as Mousse hit the tree painfully.</p><p>He got up but it was too late as he was surrounded on all sides. He was about to mutter his last prayers when a miracle happened. "SONIC FLASH!" He gapped as over a hundred Sonics in warlord armor came out the woods and began forcing back the wave of Wolf Youkai. One of them helped Mousse steady himself. "You okay buddy?" Sonic asked. Mousse nodded and then pointed at the other Sonics. "What the hell?" Sonic grinned "New move. Now tell your partner to retreat as I want to end this fast." Mousse did so and watched as Ghost used his powers and faded away as he reappeared next to Mousse and Sonic.</p><p>"You're going to love this." Sonic said as a blue glow surrounded him and his sword. His hair glowed Neon Blue as did the blade. All the other Sonics faded away and the Wolf Youkai began to charge again. Sonic raised his glowing weapon up into the air into the air and buried the tip of the blade into the earth with both hands. "SONIC STRIKER!"</p><p>Both Mousse and Ghost Jaws dropped as a blue wave of destruction came out the earth and attacked the approaching Youkai. They didn't even get a chance to scream, just simply was turned into ash. The ashes were so hard that it looked like there were hundred upon hundreds of statues in the forest now. "They're dead?" Mousse said to himself in amazement. "Extra-Dead" Sonic replied as he took out his weapon. On the ground was a chasm that was a perfect line leading from Sonic to the now dead Youkai.</p><p>"So why was an army trying to kill you Mousse" Sonic asked. Mousse shrugged. "I don't know. I never seen youkai like that before." Sonic blinked and turned. "Do you know Sesshomaru?" Mousse turned to the direction Sonic was speaking. Sesshomaru was leaning against a tree frowning. "That is quite odd. I am the leader of all canine Youkai. Wolves are included. Why would they do something like this without my permission?" He answered.</p><p>Sonic shrugged. "You should just bring them back and ask" Mousse blinked. "What?" Sonic grinned. "You're going to love this." Sesshomaru pulled out the Tenseiga. Almost immediately a ghost aura surrounded the sword, but unlike last time, there were differences. Rather then the ghost resembling a monster, there was a face resembling Sesshomaru only older and instead of that grayish green look it was solid white. The floating shoulder guards were gone, but there was armor on what was the ghost's head that lead over Sesshomaru's arm. The ghost wasn't that huge anymore, it was just outlining Sesshomaru's arm, but it radiated power unseen before.</p><p>The TaiYoukai markings on Sesshomaru's face flared white as did his eyes. Sesshomaru turned his blade out and slashed down. "Revive" A massive wave of white energy surrounded the whole forest and Mousse felt all his wounds healed, but the flare blinded him for a bit. When it cleared he gapped. All the wolf Youkai were alive again. They looked confuse until they saw Mousse. They got up and prepared to charge when. "I suggest you don't do that" Sesshomaru said.</p><p>The wolf Youkai turned and they all gasped to see who it was before getting to their knees and bowed. The glow on Sesshomaru receded until it was surrounding his arm in a gentle pulse. He pointed to one. "What were you doing?" Said Wolf Youkai. "We got orders from you from Lord Kouga that we were suppose to kill them and take the Shikon Shards." The wolf Youkai said pointing to Mousse. Sesshomaru's eyes narrowed and he frowned. "Tell all your companions that Kouga has lied to you. I gave no such orders. I want every wolf Youkai to go back to their dens, immediately. If this Kouga is seen again, I want him captured." The Youkai bowed and pretty soon, all where gone.</p><p>"I'm going to kill this Kouga." Sesshomaru said calmly. "But I need to get to the Northern Lands first." Before Mousse and Sonic could say anything. "Kouga also ordered to kill the potential mates of the Lord of the Northern lands as well as your ward." Shade said as he came back. Sesshomaru's frown deepen. "Rin? Is she?" Shade shook his head. "No, I got to the Wolf Youkai first and I'm pretty sure NekoTachi got to the others. Two thousand wolf youkai are dead." Sesshomaru nodded. "I'm glad Rin is well and make sure that NekoTachi sees that this isn't an attack on his empire.</p><p>Shade nodded. "Oh I almost forgot. There is something you all need to see, follow me." The three men and Ghost followed the massive tiger through the forest, all noticed that the forest was much more alive then before. Shade got to a clearing where there sat Rei and Ami as they held a crying Kikyo. "I know of her. My brother's dead Miko" Shade grinned. "Well there's a little problem with that. She not dead anymore." Sesshomaru was about to say something when he was glomped by Kikyo as she thanked him over and over again, even kissing him at certain points. Mousse turned to comment when he saw Sonic sitting in a lunge chair, eating some popcorn as he watched the scene. Mousse shrugged and joined him as they watched Sesshomaru tried to deal with a very grateful Kikyo. Mousse grinned. "The more things change, the more they stayed the same.</p><p>Read and Review.</p><p>A/N: Kouga's in trouble, ha ha ha. Congrads to those who figured out where I got the killers from. Now there aren't going to be exactly like the Anime, rather I took their characters and powers and teaked it a bit.</p>
