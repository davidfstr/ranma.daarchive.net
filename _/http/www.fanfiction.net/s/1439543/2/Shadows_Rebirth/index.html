</div><p>Shadow's Rebirth.</p><p>A/N:  Writers block on my other stories so they are on pause.</p><p>This is something that inspired  me from reading Ranma the Hedgehog</p><p>Mainly in Ranma's view</p><p>Not Ranma/ Akane romance,</p><p>Don't own either one</p><p>Chapter.1:  Rings and Masks</p><p>Hours later, I woke up again in midair.  Pops must have thrown me out the window  again, damn him.  I was about to twist  my body to land on my feet outside the koi pond when I catch a flash of gold in  my vision. In the air, there it was; from what I can make of it, it was metal  and circular. Unfortunately, it disappeared and I was too tried and distracted,  so I landed in the pond.  That sure woke  me up.  While under water, I saw another  flash of gold.  This time, I could see  it, maybe because I was standing still.   It was a giant golden ring that radiated power; the weird part was it  was radiating MY AURA! As if in a trance I began to reach for it, but before  my fingers could touch it, something grabbed me out the water.  Before I surfaced I cursed when I saw the  ring vanish.</p><p>I surfaced and now I'm staring into the angry face of my  much-unwanted fiancé, Akane Tendo.  She  glares before speaking, "No point in hiding so you can avoid my cooking, jerk!"  she yelled as she dragged me into the dining room by my pigtail. One day, I  swear on all that is holy, I will get her.   When I got into the house I saw everyone, Akane included, but me had a  plate of normal food.  I looked at  Nabiki and to my ire, she was laughing at me with her eyes. Fine just another  person that I'm going to get. I really hate her, "You say something,  Ranma-kun?"  Dear sweet Kasumi asks.  Silly me I must have said that out loud.</p><p>Before I could respond, Akane places a plate of…something  in front of me. I could tell it wasn't done dying a horrible death yet.  I feel sorry for any soul that gets  reincarnated as Akane's cooking.  People  ask how do I know that it alive?  It is  because it's wheezing.  I look at  Akane's plate and conformed that she is indeed not eating her own cooking.  Again she glares at me, like it is suppose  to hurt, "Well, aren't you going to eat some?"   I think it would be rude to say 'HELL NAH!'  so I panicked,  I had to  come up with something fast…Wait a moment!</p><p>I pointed to  behind the whole family, got to my feet and yelled the most disgusting thing I  could come up with, "Hey! Look over there, Cologne and Happosai are bumping and  grinding, naked!"  That got the desire  affect. Everyone but Kasumi shuddered, but all of them closed their eyes to rid  themselves of that mental image…now to stage two.  I used some of my superhuman speed to place equal portions of  Akane's food in everyone else's plate, but Kasumi of course and because it is  Kasumi's cooking no one can refuse to eat it, or it will upset her and no one  upsets dear sweet Kasumi…Revenge is mine!</p><p>I finished my  plan just in time, for everyone had opened, their eyes, having dispelled the  mental image, "I'm done!" I lie, putting a big cheesy grin on my face  '!" I say in one word before  running out the house, just barely hearing Kasumi's goodbye.  I wait outside the door for a minute, then I  hear it. The sweet sounds of choked sobs and the rushing upstairs to the  bathroom…he he he.  I use some more of  my speed to run until I'm half way to school.   I wonder if they realize what I done, "RRRRAAANNNNMMMMAAA!" I shrug  and walk to school whistling and thinking of a certain pink haired girl.</p><p>I walk into  the grounds of Furiken high, ignoring the surprised looks on everyone's  faces.  It's not like I never came to  school ear…oh wait, I've always been late. Oh well doesn't matter, I don't  really care.  I groan, because I see  Kuno stomping towards me.  In his hands  was a steel Katana…Damn Idiot! "Fowl Sorcerer Saotome! Release the fiery Akane  Tendo and my pigtailed goddess or face the heavenly wrath of Tatewaki Kuno, the  Blue Thunder!"  On que, lightning  strikes behind him.  I have neither the  time nor the patience to deal with this so I ask, "Hey Kuno-sempai! How can  thunder be blue, when all it is is just a sound?"  He freezes, "What?" He asks. I smirk internally, "Thunder has no  form, so how can it be blue?"  His eyes  glazed over and he became lost in thought, surprisingly as it sounds.  I wave my hand in front of him several  times…no response, "Oh I think I broke him, oh well".  I smirked and cheerfully walked past him  towards the entrance to the school.</p><p>I looked at  several of my classmates and found that they are shocked, that someone, much  less me managed to stop Kuno with words. Saotome, the idiot savant of fighting,  I know they think I'm stupid; hell every fiancé thinks that.  They have no idea how intelligent I am. Only  the teachers know, but I ask them to keep it a secret.  I want to see my peers faces at graduation  when they announce me as the student with the highest marks ever recorded at  Furiken, my grades are even better than Nabiki's.  I still remember the shock on Ms. Hinako's face when I displayed  my mastery of the English language.  I  smirk.  I wonder how the ol' ghoul would  take it if she knew I was fluent in Madrian. I was about to walk into the  school building when I see it</p><p>It's another  gold ring, radiating my aura again. It is floating right next to me.  Taunting me, teasing me, making me reach for  it. I was about to grab it when…"Ranma! Prepare to die!" I jump out the way of  the 300-pound umbrella smashing into the ground where I once stood.  I watch as the ring is gone again, and with  it my good mood. "Damn it straight to hell!"   I turn to Ryouga, "What do you want, P-chan?"  Ryouga growls and charges in a rage, Using Mousse's hidden  weapons technique, I pull out a bottle of water and with one toss, viola!  Instant P-chan.  To add more  insult.  I drop kick P-chan, carefully  aiming so he will land where that crazy ice-skater, Azusa practices. I won't be  seeing P-Chan for a couple of weeks</p><p>I get the  urge to look up, so I do and I find myself staring into those red eyes.  She is leaning out the window, watching  me.  I find myself waving like a fool.  She smiles and mouths the word "Remember"  Then she ducks back into the classroom, the same one I'm heading to.  What joy!   I try to move, but I'm stuck staring at the spot where she was.  I just stand there ignoring my surroundings  until a mallet slams into my head.  I  turn around and look into the slightly green, but still angry face of  Akane.  I roll my eyes, "Geeze  Akane!  What did I do now?"  She pouts in that disgustingly uncute way  that she does. Frankly it reminds me of a damn dirty ape, "If you don't know  what you done, then you don't deserve to know why I'm mad" I resist the urge to  smack the shit out of her, Kami knows she needs it.  I watch her stomp into the building and behind her a even  greener, but angry Nabiki glares at me.   Doesn't bother me one bit.  With  one jump, I enter my classroom.</p><p>I look around  and much to my disappointment Amy was gone.   I sigh wistfully as I take my seat, ignoring the daggers Akane was  glaring at my back.  Ms Hinako walks in  adult form and the class falls silent. "Okay class, I have a surprise today,"  Instantly the class went to def-con 4.   The last surprise they had was me.   He he he.  Ms. Hinako, all used  to this, ignored the alarms.  "We have  six new students today, many from other countries."  She turned towards the door. "Okay you can come in one at a time"</p><p>Amy came in  first, still wearing a Furiken uniform.   She bowed, "Hello my name is Yoko Ten" Wait I thought…no I know her name  is Amy. I put it to the back of my mind to ask her later. I looked around and  saw that the guys where drooling and the girls glared in jealousy.  It must suck for their self-esteem to have  so many good-looking people come in.  I  felt liquid on my face and too my surprise, I had a minor nosebleed.  I quickly cleaned the blood off.  Ms Hinako nodded, "Okay Miss. Ten go take  the seat next to Mr. Saotome" Every guy groaned and I could feel Akane's battle  aura form behind me, "Mr. Saotome, would you mind raising your hand so that  Miss. Ten could find her seat?"  My hand  exploded from my side and into the air, and I had a big goofy grin on my  face.  Akane's battle aura, grew but she  can't do a damn thing or the new students will find that her 'I'm all sweet and  innocent' act is total bullshit and not to mention, the teacher will drain her  faster then a yellow belly sap-sucker…well suck sap.</p><p>Amy walked towards  me, my eyes glued to her swaying hips.   As she walked by, her hand rose up and gentle stroked the side of my  face and oh my god!  It drove shivers  down my back and I had a sudden urge to do…something Kasumi would say  naughty.  I bit my lip and could feel my  face flush.  I took a glance over to  Akane and found she had her mallet out.</p><p>I look back  toward the front of the class and at the next student.  He was a native,  he had aqua blue hair.  A  lot of hair.  It went down past his back  and not to mention it was nothing but spikes.   He had matching blue eyes too. He wore the uniform but there were  differences.  The dress shirt was  unbuttoned and underneath was a matching long sleeve blue shirt in which the  sleeves where tucked into giant metal gloves.   Many metal bracelets of different designs lined up one arm, "Hey 'sup.  The names Hana Recca,  just call me by  my last name." He took the seat next to Akane and placed his feet on the desk  and went to sleep. I like him already.</p><p>The next  student was obviously gajin.  He had  dark brown skin with long reddish brown dreadlocks.  He too wore the uniform but it was different to.  Instead of the shirt being white, it was  brownish red, like his hair and over it was a medallion.  He had mirror shades on the top of his head  and headphones around his neck.  Where  Sonic had gloves this guy and gauntlets and they looked strong. "Hey, Da' name  is Rick Jones, All da' way from Ja'mica" He said in a real accent but I got the  feeling it's fake.  He took a seat next  to Uyko, put his shades and headphones and went to sleep.  I could here American rap coming from the  headphones.</p><p>The next  person to come in was also gajin. She was a pale skin beauty with snow-white  hair.  She wore all black makeup, lips,  eyes, and even her pointy nails had black on them.   She didn't wear the uniform or even a variation of it.  Instead she wore a long black dress with  giant sleeves that hid most of her hands.   It reminded me of Mousse's robe, where he hid all those weapons.  Also on her arms, it wasn't solid black like  the rest of her dress, but rather fishnets.   I looked into her eyes and found that they were a dark purple.  She spoke in an English accent "Celes  Victoria Gatesford, Great Britain."  As  usual all the other guys where drooling but I thought Amy looked better.  She walked next to Rick and kissed his cheek  then sat next to him, shattering my peer's chances.  Rick lifted his shades with one finger, smiled and put them back  down.</p><p>The next one  was a kid, looking about two years younger.   He had messy bright orange hair and was also gajin.  His face had numerous freckles on it.  On top of his head, some black goggles and  strapped from his left shoulder to his right hip, was something like Ukyo's bandolier,  but instead of spatulas, wrenches, screwdrivers other tools, and underneath was  a the uniform, even though it was extremely baggy    He bowed, "The name is Miles all the way from Germany, you're  going to have to guess my last name" I could hear a couple girls whisper about  he being so cute.  Miles took a seat  next to the sleeping Recca, who just cracked an eye open and just went back to  sleep.</p><p>Everyone  waited, for the last new student to come in, but no one came in.  Suddenly there was a blinding flare, and  when it cleared, there she was standing.  With bright blue hair cut somewhat like Nabiki's style, in a white  t-shirt that was cut to expose her stomach, blue skirt that matched her  to go over it.  To top it off was an open blue vest that went to her knees.  Her eyes though where gray and it felt like  she was staring at you right down to the core.   She looked at me wide-eyed before her eyes slanted like a fox  spirit.  "Hello my name is Kay Hos, that's  all you need to know." She went to a seat that was in the corner where Hiroshi  was, "Move" the coward he was, he moved out the seat and took the only one in  the front.  Kay sat down and proceeded  to stare out the window.</p><p>I take the  time before the lesson starts to check out the energy patterns of every new  student, and I am very impressed, They are all a little under my level but  Recca, he is equal.  I am shocked.  Hopefully they don't try to kill me, but  there is something, familiar about the auras, like I have encountered them  before.  Ms. Hinako starts her lesson  and I start me little act of not paying attention, when I'm really am.</p><p>Halfway  through the lesson, I get the feeling that someone is watching me, besides  Akane, because all she does is glare at me, so I tune her out.  I look around and find that Amy is staring  at me.  I smile and she returns it, plus  a note [I bet you're wondering why I said my name is Amy?]   I pass back my response [Probably because  that is your nick name or middle name and wanted to get close to me…or you're  making fun of me]  She giggled and I  could feel the return of Akane's battle aura, it only grew as Amy passed  another note, [It's a special name, but you already know that.  Do you remember yours yet?]</p><p>I dodge to the left to avoid a mallet and duck to avoid a  spatula.  No one noticed except for the  new students as they watch me dodge the 'disproval' from my fiancés and pass my  note, [No but I can feel it on the tip of my tongue] Amy smiled sadly and  responded, [It'll come to you just try to remember]  I duck under another mallet swing and press a pressure point on  Akane's wrist, causing her to drop the mallet, much to her surprised. "You dodged  mallet-sama?"  I grin and grab 'mallet-sama'  and toss it out the window, right on the still brain dead Kuno</p><p>Amy looks out the window and giggles, a sound that sounds  like angels singing. "Is that guy okay" She asked,  I sigh "Yeah, the Kuno family have very hard heads. That one is a  self-delusional pervert.  You shouldn't  go nowhere near him"  She shrugs "Ah"  Then her eyes widen in amazement as I duck  under another swing from a mallet.   Where the hell does she get them?   I'm guessing out her ass, but I'm just annoyed.</p><p>Amy leans in a whisper, "Does this happen to you all the  time?"  I nodded "I'm the best martial  artist around her and this unwanted fiancé by arrangement between two lazy drunkards  think that she can hit me whenever she wants, but recently I decided screw her"  The class grows silent as I pause to snatch the mallet out of mid-swing and  break it over one knee.  I know I'm  going to get hell later, but I don't care.   I noticed that Recca is fully awake and staring at me, interested.  I'll have to spar with him later.</p><p>Before anything else goes on, Ms Hinako interrupts, "Mr.  Saotome, Miss. Ten, no talking, go into the halls" and then she winks. "Oh okay  teach," my code for thanks.  What people  don't know is that Ms. Hinako doesn't have to drain someone to turn into an  adult or stay one. After the incident where she first showed up, I taught her  how to draw off of environmental chi..   Amy looks at me confused, so I just wink and mouth the words, "Follow me."</p><p>"What was that about?" She asked the minute I closed the  door.  I paused, Should I tell her?  I glance at her and find that she is  cheerfully waiting, my answer. I want Amy to know me, not the mask that  everyone thinks I am.  I look around and  see that no one is around, "Around this school, I'm considered an idiot, but  none of them realize that I have the highest marks. I'm a genius yet I wanted  no one to know.  So I asked all the  teachers to treat me like an idiot and all I have to do is the assignments and  past the test.  Ms. Hinako teaches English.  I speak it fluently, most likely you do too,  right?"  She nodded, "So we get t o do  whatever.  Tell me Amy do you know the  other students?"  She nods, "We all have  history, we are very close" I grin; "I remember when me and Sonic first fought"  Wait a minute, who is Sonic? I look at Amy and she looking at me all wide-eyed.  She opens her mouth and closes it.  "Amy?"  She is staring at me with a huge grin, "Ranma,  What did you just say?"</p><p>End chapter<br/>Read and Revieww</p>
