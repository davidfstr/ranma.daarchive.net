I claim no ownership of any character and such in any way.<p>"" = Spoken words<br/>** = Thoughts<br/>{} = Cabbit<p>Ever so slowly the sun peaked over the horizon as morning dawned upon the Masaki Shrine. The lake glimmered in the morning light while songbirds sang their lovely songs. It was a picture of peace and tranquility.<p>Two log guardians sat at the entrance to the Masaki compound. Both vigilant while they admired the beauty of nature around them.<p>"Ah, what a beautiful morning." said Azaka.<p>"That it is. Such a peaceful one too." said Kamidake.<p>"Indeed" replied Azaka.<p>A few birds flew overhead on their way to perch upon the Masaki household. Inside resided several of the most powerful beings on the planet. In one room, a young man slowly awoke as the rays of sunshine shone in his face. His name was Tenchi Masaki. He was the grandson of the nearby shrine's priest. And he also happened to be the champion of a certain kind hearted goddess.<p>Sitting up, Tenchi rubbed the sleep out of his eyes as he slowly got out of bed. Grabbing a few things, he groggily he made his way to the bathroom to clean up for the day ahead.<p>Meanwhile, in another room, a certain martial artist began to wake. Slowly her eyes opened to gaze upon the ceiling. She smiled as she recalled spending time with her mother the previous evening. A slight movement to her side caused her to freeze momentarily. Looking down at the bundle that was snuggled up to her, she smiled and relaxed a little. Sasami was cuddled up to Ranma's side while sleeping peacefully. Bringing her hand up, Ranma stroked Sasami's hair a few times.<p>The slight movement of Ranma awoke a certain friendly little cabbit. Yawning a little, Ryo-Ohki blinked away her sleepiness and looked around. She saw that her bed was stroking the hair of her favorite person. Wanting to be pet too, Ryo-Ohki decided to greet the new comer.<p>{"Good Morning"} said Ryo-Ohki. Although to most it would have come out as a simple Miyahh, to Ranma it sounded like a female was saying good morning.<p>"Huh?" said Ranma wondering who spoke.<p>Looking around she couldn't see anyone other than Sasami who was still asleep. Feeling something moving on her belly, she looked down to see Ryo-Ohki, looking at her. Wondering about it a moment, Ranma's question was answered by Ryo-Ohki speaking again.<p>{"Hello."} said Ryo-Ohki.<p>Blinking a moment, Ranma said, "Um... Hello."<p>Curious, Ryo-Ohki could swear her perch had understood her. But from her past experience, the only ones that could understand her were Ryoko and Washu. But that was from a mental link with them. And even that was limited. Deciding to test something, Ryo-Ohki spoke again.<p>{"Do you understand me?"} asked the little cabbit hopefully.<p>Blinking some more, Ranma said, "Um... Yeah. How come you can talk?"<p>Her test confirmed, Ryo-Ohki cheered happily. Someone that she could talk to finally. She could understand people easily but communicating back was always something she couldn't do. Now she had found someone that could understand her. She was very happy.<p>Ranma watched as the little cabbit became really happy. Was it because she could understand the little creature? From the sounds of the little cabbit, that began to sound like what the case was.<p>"Are you ok?" asked Ranma.<p>Stopping in her celebration, Ryo-Ohki looked back at Ranma. Nodding, Ryo-Ohki responded, {"Yes I am. I've never really had anyone understand me before besides Ryoko-neechan and Washu-kasan."}<p>"Washu is your mom and Ryoko is your sister?" asked Ranma.<p>Shaking her head, Ryo-Ohki said, {"They are not related to me. I just call them that because of how I view them."}<p>"Ah. I've met Washu. She seemed nice. Ryoko I've only met briefly." said Ranma.<p>Sitting on her haunches, Ryo-Ohki asked, {"Would you like to be my friend?"}<p>Smiling, Ranma nodded as best she could. Seeing the cabbit's reaction, Ranma smiled some more. For some reason she liked the little creature. It sounded like a cat but didn't quite look like one. She wondered if it was because of the Neko-Ken that she could understand the little creature. The panther did say that she'd be able to communicate with cats as well as have a deep love for them. Perhaps that was why she found herself falling for the antics of the little cabbit.<p>"What's your name?" asked Ranma.<p>Happy that she had made a new friend, Ryo-Ohki said, {My name is Ryo-Ohki. How about you?"}<p>"My name is Ranma." replied Ranma.<p>Curious again, Ryo-Ohki asked, {"I thought Sasami called you Rhea."}<p>Chuckling lightly, Ranma said, "Well that was my name in my previous life. You see, I was born on Jurai to a woman named Tsunami."<p>Surprise shone on her features, Ryo-Ohki said, {"So you're Tsunami-sama's daughter. No wonder Sasami was so happy."}<p>Smiling, Ranma said, "Well I'm more than her daughter. I'm also her son."<p>Confused, Ryo-Ohki said, {"Son? But you are female."}<p>Chuckling a little, Ranma said, "Well I was born male. I acquired a curse that turns me female when I get splashed with cold water. Hot water will return me to my male form."<p>Still confused, Ryo-Ohki said, {"But how?"}<p>"I'll explain later. For now I think I should get up. It's going to be a busy morning and I have a few things to do." said Ranma.<p>About that time, Sasami began to wake. Opening her eyes, she saw Ranma and Ryo-Ohki... Talking?<p>"Oneeniichan? Who are you talking to?" said Sasami as she rubbed her eyes.<p>Looking over at Ryo-Ohki a moment, the little cabbit Miyahh'd.<p>{"You can tell her"} said the cabbit. However only Ranma understood her.<p>Both Ranma and Sasami sat up. Smiling at Sasami, Ranma said, "Good Morning imouto-chan. I was just talking with Ryo-Ohki here."<p>"Talking? But how?" asked Sasami.<p>"I'm not too certain about that myself. I think it's from a technique I learned called the Neko-Ken. It allowed me to understand and communicate with cats and judging from Ryo-Ohki here, it would seem cat like animals as well." said Ranma.<p>"That's neat! I wanna learn the Neko-Ken so I can talk with Ryo-Ohki too!" said a now more awake Sasami. However her excited state was lost when she saw the look on Ranma's face.<p>"I'm sorry Sasami. I can't do that. I would not wish that horror upon anyone." said Ranma.<p>"Why? What's so bad about it oneeniichan?" asked Sasami.<p>Sighing, Ranma decided to tell her. Best to let her know before she tried to find out about it some other way.<p>Ryo-Ohki also perked up. She too wanted to know how someone could learn how to speak with her.<p>"You see Sasami, when I was really young, the man who raised me got ahold of a training manual for a martial arts technique called the Neko-ken. However he didn't read the whole manual. The training involved wrapping me up in various fish products and tossing me into a pit of starving cats. He kept doing it until I finally snapped and learnt the technique. It gave me an intense fear of anything feline and it was cause of him and that technique that my Juraian heritage was sealed away. It was only recently that I merged with the Neko-ken and gained the ability you wanted." said Ranma<p>By now Sasami was in tears. To be put through something that horrible while so young. She wanted nothing to do with it now. Her oneeniichan was right in not wanting to subject her to it. Wrapping her arms around the older girl, Sasami hugged her for all she was worth.<p>"That's horrible! I don't wanna learn it now." said a crying Sasami.<p>Ryo-Ohki miyahh'd her opinion too, {"If I ever get my claws on that man!"}<p>Smiling down at the little bundle in her arms, Ranma said, "It's alright. I didn't really want you to worry about me. That's why I didn't mention it earlier. Don't mention it to anyone either. Only those that need to know have any knowledge of it."<p>Nodding, Sasami wiped away her tears. If her oneeniichan said it was ok, then that was ok with her. Standing up, Sasami began to get ready for the day ahead. It was still fairly early and she had to make breakfast.<p>Ranma picked up Ryo-Ohki and stood up as well. Looking around a moment, she realized she left her pack up at the shrine. Stepping over to the door, Ranma opened it before turning around to say, "I'll be back Sasami. I need to get my pack from the shrine."<p>"Ok Ranma-neechan." said Sasami while fixing her hair.<p>Stepping out into the hallway, Ranma headed downstairs. Arriving at the door, she was met with the site of one Tenchi Masaki putting some shoes on.<p>"Hello" she said.<p>Tenchi, not expecting anyone to be up yet was quite startled. Turning around, he was met with the site of a female Ranma looking at him while holding Ryo-Ohki.<p>"Um... Hello. You're Ranma? Right?" said Tenchi.<p>Smiling, Ranma nodded, "Yeah. And I'd assume yer Tenchi."<p>Nodding, Tenchi replied, "Yeah."<p>"Sorry about last night. Yer grandpa put me up to it." said Ranma.<p>"It's alright. I'm just glad you could take care of yourself. Ryoko and Ayeka don't get along too well unless it involves defending me." said Tenchi.<p>"No Problem. They weren't that tough. So where are you off to so early in the morning?" asked Ranma.<p>"I'm going up to the shrine so I can practice with Grandpa." replied Tenchi.<p>"Mind if I tag along?" asked Ranma.<p>"I don't mind." replied Tenchi.<p>Stepping outside, the two began their journey toward the shrine.<p>Turning to Tenchi, Ranma asked, "So, what do you practice?"<p>"Grandpa's been teaching me how to use a sword for a while now. He's been teaching me Juraian sword forms lately." said Tenchi.<p>"A sword eh? You do know that weapons can be a crutch in battle if it's taken away from you. Do you know any unarmed fighting techniques?" said Ranma<p>Shaking his head, Tenchi replied, "Umm... Not really. I only know how to use a sword. But I can't really be disarmed either."<p>"Oh? How so?" asked Ranma.<p>Scratching the back of his head, Tenchi replied, "Well I can use the light hawk sword. It can't be taken away from me."<p>"Ah, so your the one mom was talking about. The one she gifted with the light hawk wings." said Ranma.<p>"Mom?" he asked himself before realization dawned on his face. The lengthy conversation from the previous night coming back to him.<p>"Oh yeah. You're Tsunami's daughter. Is it true that you are really a guy?" asked Tenchi.<p>Smiling a little, Ranma nodded. "Yeah, I was born on earth as a guy. Picked up the curse in China that turns me female."<p>"Yeah, Grandpa told us all about that last night. The two people that came with you filled in the missing details as well." said Tenchi.<p>"They didn't mention anything called the Neko-Ken did they?" asked Ranma. Her face very serious. Ryo-Ohki almost growled at the name of that technique.<p>"Umm... No. Not that I recall. Why?" said Tenchi.<p>"No reason. Just forget it." said Ranma.<p>Tenchi simply nodded.<p>By now the two were about halfway up the steps to the shrine. As they continued up the stairs, the two began to loosen up around one another. Each talking about various things they had experienced. From numerous fiancee's to battling intergalactic criminals, the two became fast friends. Ryo-Ohki just snuggled up to Ranma and listened to her stories.<p>*******************<p>Up at the shrine, three people sat sipping tea. All had risen early due to Katsuhito training Tenchi today. The two elders that accompanied Ranma wanted to see how good Tenchi was.<p>"So how long have you been teaching Tenchi?" asked Happi.<p>"For quite a few years now. Why?" replied Katsuhito.<p>"No reason. I was just curious. Have you taught him any advanced Juraian sword techniques?" said Happi.<p>"I've only recently begun teaching them to him. So far I've been teaching him basic sword forms and such. However he's shown that he is ready for the more advanced techniques." said Katsuhito.<p>Nodding, Happi said, "I'd like to see him for myself. After all, I was the head combat instructor for the palace security. Appointed by the emperor himself no less."<p>Blinking at the new information, Katsuhito said, "Really? You never mentioned it before. Just that you were Juraian. Perhaps we can compare notes on Tenchi's training later. But how did you end up like you are now?"<p>"I don't really want to talk about it." said Happi.<p>Smiling, Cologne said, "Come now Happi. Why don't you tell him how you stole a couple pairs of panties from that woman, Misaki."<p>Happosai paled as Cologne revealed what he had done all those centuries ago. Slowly he turned his head toward Katsuhito.<p>Noticing Happi's facial expression, Katsuhito began to chuckle a bit with Cologne joining in as well. Both soon broke down into laughter at the site. Happi however failed to see the joke.<p>After a moment, Katsuhito and Cologne calmed down a bit. "Do not worry. I do not care about what you've done in the past. All I ask is that you do not do it to any of the girls here. They would be quite upset and might do worse than mother did. Especially Sasami or Ayeka. They are both Misaki's daughters." said Katsuhito.<p>Nodding, Happi decided to keep quiet about that little incident from now on. Too many people were around that were connected to Misaki. Especially the two pretty ladies Katsuhito just mentioned.<p>It was about that time that two voices from outside alerted Katsuhito, Happi, and Cologne that there were visitors. Rising, Katsuhito opened the door to see Tenchi and Ranma walking toward the shrine talking adamantly about something. In Ranma's arms rested Ryo-Ohki.<p>Katsuhito smiled. It was too bad Ranma was born male. Most likely Ranma was only interested in girls. The two would have made a good couple. Especially with their long lifespans. They could have been together forever. Well, it was not to be. He knew that Ayeka and Ryoko were after Tenchi. He had also noticed that Ryoko was calming down and it appeared she was developing feelings for Ayeka as well. Only time would tell how things would turn out.<p>Tenchi and Ranma finished their conversation as soon as they noticed Katsuhito, Cologne, and Happosai watching them. Happi looked a little pale while Cologne was chuckling about something.<p>Reaching to the side, Katsuhito grabbed two bokkens. Tossing one to Tenchi, the old priest stepped down into the courtyard. Moving to one side, he brought up his bokken.<p>On the other side of the courtyard stood Tenchi, his own bokken at the ready. Ranma had moved over to the shrine to sit with the elders. All three visitors were curious as to how good Tenchi was. Happosai and Ranma paid the most attention. Cologne glanced briefly at the cabbit before returning her attention to the fight.<p>At some unknown signal, the two combatants rushed toward one another to meet with a loud crack as the bokkens connected. The two combatants fought back and forth. Each using basic sword skills. A slash here. A block there. This lasted for only a few minutes. It served as a sort of warm-up to the real training.<p>To the sidelines, Happosai analyzed the fight. *Hmm... The boy has potential. He knows how to use the sword but he is slightly hesitating. He seems to have a confidence problem. It's as if he's not confident in his own abilities. I will have to speak with the boy later. Yosho on the other hand is as good as they said he was. Powerful, graceful, and confident. A true warrior.*<p>Next to him, Ranma conducted his own analysis. *Wow. The old man could run circles around Kuno. He doesn't waste a lot of movement. All his strikes are perfect. Tenchi seems to be a little pressed to keep up. He's hesitating. Seems he's not confident enough in his skills. Maybe I can help him work on it later.*<p>While the two visitors watched the fight, Katsuhito and Tenchi had separated to rest a little and prepare for the next part. Katsuhito raised his bokken and spoke to Tenchi.<p>"Tenchi. I want to you execute the technique I taught you." said Katsuhito.<p>Ranma perked up at the mention of a technique. Perhaps it was one he didn't know?<p>Happi just shook his head when he noticed Ranma perk up.<p>Cologne simply smirked.<p>"Are you sure Grandpa? You might get hurt." said Tenchi.<p>"I'm sure. Now just do it." said Katsuhito.<p>"Alright" said Tenchi.<p>Concentrating, Tenchi gathered the energy needed for this Juraian sword technique. Once the energy was gathered, he willed it into the wooden blade.<p>"Tsume No Taka Kara Tengai!" shouted Tenchi as he brought his bokken forward.<br/>(((Tsume No Taka Kara Tengai = Talons of the Hawk from Beyond the Heavens. I think. Someone verify me.)))<p>Blue energy lanced out forming three energy blades parallel with one another. They sped toward the awaiting priest kicking up dust and dirt as they went along.<p>Katsuhito prepared himself to stop the technique. He knew the counter to it and didn't want any of the trees to get damaged. He smiled inwardly as he remembered when he first showed Tenchi the technique. Tenchi didn't think he'd be able to do it. Day after day of practicing had shown that Tenchi did have what it took to learn the advanced Juraian sword techniques. He had advanced far enough to begin the advanced training.<p>Off to the side, Happosai smiled and nodded to himself. He knew that technique as well. It was one of the lesser Juraian sword techniques which channeled the power of Jurai.<p>Ranma however had an odd look in his eye. He'd seen a new technique and couldn't wait to try and learn it. It looked simple enough. Briefly he wondered if a sword was needed to execute it. From the appearance of the attack, it appeared he might be able to adapt it to work with the Neko-Ken.<p>Back at the battle, the energy blades had reached Katsuhito. Quickly he brought his bokken down in a horizontal slash. Under normal conditions, the bokken would have been sliced apart. However the piece of wood he held was imbued with the power of Jurai. As such he was able to slash the attack and interrupt its energy matrix causing it to dispel harmlessly into the air.<p>Tenchi breathed a sigh of relief as the attack was stopped. He didn't like using techniques like these. They were deadly and he preferred to be more peaceful. Although recent events had forced him to begin learning them. He also didn't care much for the fact he'd also been forced to kill. However it was a decision he could live with since the lives of his loved ones were in danger.<p>Katsuhito relaxed his stance and bowed to Tenchi before moving toward the shrine where the visitors were watching. Tenchi followed suit and came up next to his grandpa.<p>"So, what do you think?" asked Katsuhito.<p>Taking a puff of his pipe, Happosai said, "He show's promise. The technique was well executed. However he needs to stop hesitating. Such hesitation could mean the difference between life or death one day. He also needs to gain more confidence in himself."<p>Nodding, Katsuhito turned to Ranma, "And what did you think Ranma?"<p>"Well, he's way better than this one idiot back in Nerima who uses nothing but a sword. But I agree with the old man on this one. Tenchi needs to stop hesitating when he strikes. I also think he needs to learn some unarmed combat as well." said Ranma.<p>"I agree." said Katsuhito before turning to Tenchi. "Do you understand what they are saying Tenchi? You must not hesitate when you face an opponent. Your opponent could use your hesitation against you."<p>Nodding, Tenchi said, "Yes Grandpa. I just... Well... I didn't want to hurt you."<p>Placing his hand on Tenchi's shoulder, Katsuhito said, "You mustn't worry about such things Tenchi. You must learn to rely on your instincts. You have a good heart but you hold yourself back because you do not wish to do harm to others. That is a respectable quality and one to be proud of. However when in battle, that quality can become a liability."<p>"I know Grandpa. It's just that I don't like fighting like this. What if something happened and you got hurt severely. I don't know what I'd do." said Tenchi.<p>"Yo, don't worry about it too much Tenchi. Your gramps is right. When in battle you can't hesitate but that still doesn't mean you have to stop caring about people. I do it every time I'm in a fight with someone I care about. I won't hesitate to battle them but I won't cause them lasting harm either. Besides, your grandfather can take it." said Ranma.<p>Happosai nodded, "He's right. Some people will not back down just because you ask them to. Sometimes you must fight to protect those you care about. I've done it and I'm sure Katsuhito here has done it as well. Even Ranma here has had to do it."<p>Nodding, Tenchi said, "Ok. I'll try to work on it."<p>Turning to Ranma, Katsuhito asked, "Would you like to spar?"<p>Thinking about it a moment, Ranma shook his head. "I'd like to, but not right now. I have something more pressing to do and I'm afraid I'll need all my energy for it."<p>Nodding, Katsuhito said, "Well why don't we all go back to the house. Sasami should have breakfast finished soon."<p>Receiving nods all around, everyone began to head for the house. However Ranma stayed back for a moment.<p>"Hey Happosai. Hold up a moment. I need to talk with you privately." said Ranma.<p>Happi turned and nodded. Everyone else left since Ranma said it was private. Cologne however wondered what Ranma wanted to talk to Happi about. And what would Ranma need all his energy for? He was a literal powerhouse by her standards.<p>Ryo-Ohki sat on Ranma's shoulder and miyahh'd quietly. Ranma turned and smiled. "You can stay."<p>As soon as everyone was out of sight, Ranma sat on the porch of the shrine. Motioning him over, Ranma waited until Happi was situated.<p>"So what did you want to talk to me about my boy?" asked Happi.<p>Thinking a moment, Ranma said, "Last night I was visiting with my mother."<p>"You visited Tsunami-sama?" asked a slightly wide eyed Happosai.<p>Nodding, Ranma continued, "Yes. Sasami thought I'd like to see my mother. She took me there last night while I slept."<p>"So what happened?" asked Happi.<p>"We caught up with each other from the thousands of years we've been apart. She also taught me a few new things like transporting between trees and other ways of using my power." said Ranma.<p>Nodding, Happi asked, "Interesting. So what did you need to talk to me about?"<p>"Well, I asked her about what that Misaki lady did to you. She said she had wondered what had happened. She felt your connection to her diminish abut 300 years ago." replied Ranma.<p>"Go on." said Happi.<p>Chuckling a little, Ranma said, "Yeah, she was amused with the part of you stealing Misaki's panties. But she also said that Misaki went too far in punishing you. Only she has the right to remove the power of Jurai from someone."<p>A little pale that his goddess knows of his little acquisition, Happi nervously asked, "So what does this mean for me?"<p>Smiling, Ranma said, "Well it means that I can now undo what Misaki did to you. Mom taught me how to do what Misaki did and how to undo it. "<p>Happi looked up at Ranma, hope evident in his eyes. Finally his years of suffering were over. The power of Jurai would be his once again.<p>"But she did say there was one stipulation on it." said Ranma.<p>"What did she say?" asked Happi. He'd do anything to regain what Misaki took away.<p>Smirking a little evilly, Ranma said, "She said that you were to stop stealing women's undergarments as well as stop groping every girl you come across."<p>Happi knew the price would be high. But for it to be his favorite past time and hobby. A warrior's life was fraught with peril. Sighing, Happi simply nodded.<p>"Very well. From this day forth, I Happosai, of the house Agemi, shall no longer steal another piece of women's lingerie nor shall I grope a woman unless it is consensual. This I swear to my goddess and her child." stated Happi.<p>A little put off by the long winded speech, Ranma said, "Yeah, well a simple ok would have been enough. Anyways, let's get started. This is going to drain me a bit since I'm still working on building up my stores of Juraian power. Now, face me and close your eyes."<p>Nodding, Happosai faced Ranma and closed his eyes. Briefly before his eyes shut, he saw some kind of furry creature on Ranma's shoulder. Shrugging to himself, he decided he'd ask after this was done with.<p>Seeing that Happi was ready, Ranma reached forward and laid her hand upon Happi's forehead. Closing her eyes, Ranma concentrated and began to search for the nodes in Happi's body that needed to be opened to undo what Misaki did to him all those years ago.<p>In her mind's eye, Ranma saw the nodes that made up the energy network of Happosai. Many were bright and full of energy. Most likely energy he siphoned off girls he groped mused Ranma. Some of them were fading, probably due to not having a recharge in so long. Soon Ranma came to several nodes, all dull blue with some sort of blue energy surrounding them. Tsunami said they would look like this. The blue energy being Misaki's power keeping Happi from utilizing his birthright.<p>Ranma concentrated on the glowing power that surrounded the nodes. Using her own power, she cut Misaki's power away. It was easy since she was the child of Tsunami. Any one other than herself, her mother, or Misaki would not have been able to do this.<p>Once Misaki's power was removed, the nodes began to glow again. Blue energy pulsed out of them and filled Happosai's being. It was quite beautiful thought Ranma before she pulled her senses back in to her own body. Opening her eyes, she watched as Happosai began to glow. Shortly after his body began to grow taller while his age reduced. Soon knelt a man that looked about 35 years old. However he was much older in reality.<p>Happi felt his body changing after the surge of Juraian power. How much he missed having the power of Jurai within him. The human energy within his body left and was replaced by Juraian energy. As soon as things settled down, he opened his eyes. His eyesight met with the top of Ranma's female form. Glancing down, he smiled.<p>"Did it work?" he asked. His voice taking on a tone more in tune with his new age.<p>Nodding, Ranma said, "Yes it did. However I have to tell you that you probably lost a couple hundred years because of what Misaki did."<p>Taking the new information in, Happi nodded.<p>Standing up, the two began their journey toward the Masaki household. Ranma plucked the furry cabbit off her shoulder and held it to her bosom. Gently she stroked Ryo-Ohki's head behind the ears in a special little spot. Ryo-Ohki purred in contentment. Somehow Ranma had found her favorite spot to be rubbed. A spot that very few humans could find. Only Sasami was ever able to find that spot.<p>"How do you feel? And why are you so tall?" asked Ranma.<p>Glancing over at the redhead, Happi smiled, "I feel great. I haven't felt this good in ages. And what do you mean why am I so tall? I was this tall on Jurai."<p>"You remember when we first encountered the NanBan Mirror and I was sent into the past. Well we saw you and Cologne. Only you two were much younger. Cologne was a little taller than I am but you were fairly short." said Ranma.<p>Nodding, Happosai said, "That's true. When Misaki sealed my access to the power of Jurai, she also forced it from my body. It was a bit painful. It had the effect of dehydrating my body of energy which resulted in my loss of height. My body compensated so it could survive on what miniscule power I had left. Human energy wasn't enough to return me to my original height though."<p>"Ah, I got it." said Ranma.<p>"So how about you? You didn't use up all your energy did you?" asked Happosai.<p>Shaking her head, Ranma said, "I'm not too bad. I have more energy left than I thought I would. My reserves must have grown last night when I stopped Nabiki from killing my mother."<p>"WHAT?" shouted Happosai as he twirled toward Ranma.<p>Realizing what she said out loud, Ranma said, "Shhh... Settle down. She's alright."<p>"What happened?" asked Happi. His face and tone serious. He cared a great deal for Nodoka. He didn't want to see anything happen to her.<p>"Last night while I was with Tsunami, I felt anger along my connection with the sword I made for mom using the light hawk wings. Someone was swinging the sword toward my mom's neck. I stopped the sword a few inches above her neck and then called out to her. She woke up and unmasked her attacker. It was Nabiki. Apparently Nabiki blames me for Akane's death. She thought she could kill my mother." said Ranma.<p>Sighing, Happi said, "I was afraid something like this would happen. That girl is smart but still, I can't believe she'd resort to something like this."<p>"Last night mom said that the death of a loved one can affect a person in many ways." said Ranma.<p>Nodding, Happosai said, "She is right. I just didn't expect it from Nabiki."<p>"Me neither" replied Ranma.<p>The two continued down the steps toward the Masaki household. Silence ensued as the two were lost to their own thoughts. Ranma however continued to pet Ryo-Ohki in that oh so special spot that most humans could never find.<p>*******************<p>Meanwhile...<p>Just outside the area that made up the valley where the Masaki shrine was built, a robed man walked along a path. The path would eventually lead him to the shrine itself. On the man's back was a backpack. Occasionally the sound of metal clanking together could be heard coming from the pack and the man's robes.<p>Mousse walked along admiring the beauty around him. He had a destination to reach that day and he would soon arrive. Briefly he wondered how Cologne would react to him showing up. He was unable to call since he wanted to leave before anyone thought to look for him.<p>*I hope Elder Ku Lon doesn't mind that I was unable to keep track of Xian Pu. I'll just have to tell her what happened as well as tell her that I agree with the advice she gave me. I just wonder where I could find someone to fall in love with and who could love me back equally.* thought Mousse.<p>*******************<p>At the Masaki household, a young woman sneezed.<p>*******************<p>Back in Nerima...<p>Ukyo had just finished closing down everything for an extended trip away. Nodoka and Kasumi awaited her in the restaurant area. It was still early and Nodoka felt that the earlier they got started, the less chance of someone following them.<p>Once finished, Ukyo grabbed her own pack and nodded to Kasumi and Nodoka. The three women left the establishment and proceeded to the nearest train station. Unlike the others that were going to the Masaki shrine, they did not want to walk all the way there. They would take the train and then walk the rest of the way from the station nearest the shrine.<p>A few blocks and the women arrived at the station. Nodoka stepped up to the window and bought three tickets. Kasumi and Ukyo both watched around to make sure nobody saw them.<p>Soon the three were safely on the train and on their way to the Masaki shrine. They were quiet and each was lost in their own thoughts. Most of those thoughts revolved around a certain pigtailed martial artist.<p>*******************<p>Just outside the Masaki household, Ranma sneezed. Looking around, Ranma wondered who was thinking about her. Shrugging to herself, Ranma and the youthened Happosai entered the house.<p>In the living room, the family sat around the table waiting for breakfast to be served. A few wondered where two of their guests were.<p>The sound of the door opening and closing brought their attention to Ranma as she entered the living room. Most had seen her the night before. Either while she was fighting with Ayeka and Ryoko or after she fell unconscious.<p>Katsuhito wondered where Happosai was briefly before a man stepped in behind Ranma. Curious, Katsuhito wondered who the man was. Most of the others wondered the same thing. All except one.<p>Cologne's eyes widened as the man stepped into the living room. She knew who he was. She remembered all those years ago when he first came to the village. He looked a little older now as well as a bit taller than what she remembered. Or perhaps younger since earlier that morning but still much taller, but still...<p>"Happi. What happened to you?" she asked.<p>Katsuhito spared a brief glance at Cologne before returning his attention to Happosai. He was curious as to how he had regained his youth. Katsuhito knew that Happi didn't have access to a disguise field like the one he wore.<p>Sitting down at the table, Happi smiled at Cologne. "Ranma undid what was done to me all those years ago. I lost a couple hundred years, gained a few inches, but I am once again able to use the power of Jurai."<p>Looking over at Ranma, Cologne's unasked question was answered with, "Mom taught me." Nodding, Cologne turned back to Happosai. He was still handsome after all these years she thought. Briefly she sighed to herself.<p>To the side, Washu watched the events as they happened. This was something new but nothing she hadn't researched before. However the look in Cologne's eyes made her pause.<p>*She cares for him. Perhaps even loves him. Now's he's young again while she remains old. I will have to talk to her after breakfast. Perhaps I can help her.* thought Washu.<p>It was about that time that Sasami announced breakfast was ready. She smiled upon seeing Happosai returned to his real age. Her smile faltered slightly as she caught a look at Cologne. However the look upon Washu's face brought her smile back. After breakfast she was going to talk with Washu.<p>Katsuhito looked over at Ranma, "Ranma, I'd like to introduce you to everyone here. This is detective's Mihoshi and Kiyone." he said indicating the two Galaxy Police Officers.<p>"Hello." said Kiyone.<p>"Hi!" said Mihoshi.<p>"And over here is Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi." said Katsuhito.<p>"Yes, I've had the pleasure of meeting them." said Ranma.<p>"Hi." replied Tenchi.<p>"Hey." said Ryoko.<p>"I'm terribly sorry for what happened last evening Lady Ranma. If I had known, I would not have done such a thing." said Ayeka.<p>"Um, yeah. Don't worry about it." said Ranma with a slight twitch at being called a lady. She might not mind her female form anymore, but she still harbored some feelings from before about her sexuality.<p>"And I believe you already know Washu and Sasami." he said smiling.<p>Smiling, Ranma nodded.<p>Soon, breakfast was laid out and the Masaki residents began to eat. Ranma received a few stares at the amount she was consuming so fast. Realizing what she was doing, Ranma slowed down and began to eat more normally.<p>Ayeka thought that Lady Ranma would have to be taught how to be a proper lady of Jurai. Ryoko however just smiled and began to eat. She liked Ranma. The girl err boy had spunk and could keep up with her in a good fight. Although she still had yet to see Ranma in her male form.<p>*******************<p>Back in Nerima...<p>Shampoo had just woken up. Today she would again try and find her beloved airen. Dressing quickly, she left the Nekohanten and hopped onto her bike. Her first stop was Ucchans. She knew the chef was hiding something from her. And today she was going to find out.<p>A few minutes passed before she rode up to the restaurant. On the door was a sign that said Ucchans was closed due to family emergency. Cursing in Mandarin, Shampoo left for the Tendo compound. If anybody knew what was going on, it would be the mercenary girl.<p>A few more minutes passed as Shampoo rode to the Tendo's. Upon arriving, she was alerted to the sound of a man crying. Most likely the kitchen destroyer's father still crying over the death of his girl.<p>Stepping in, she was awarded the sight of a bawling Soun and Genma as a panda trying to comfort him. Blinking at the sight of a large panda trying to comfort a grown man, she cleared her throat. Soun stopped his waterworks and looked over at Shampoo. Genma did likewise.<p>"Where mercenary girl?" asked Shampoo.<p>At the mention of Nabiki, Soun burst into a fresh set of tears. Genma got up and doused himself with some hot water from a convenient tea kettle.<p>"She's not here. Last night she tried to kill my wife." said Genma. His voice serious.<p>"Aiya. What happen?" asked Shampoo. She didn't think that Nabiki had it in her.<p>"According to the note Nodoka left, Nabiki blamed the boy for Akane's death. She tried to kill Nodoka last night but somehow failed. Nodoka took Kasumi and left. She didn't state where though. Just that they were going to be with the boy." said Genma.<p>Nodding, Shampoo rushed out of the house. She had to find Ranma's mother and hope that she hadn't left already. If she did then Shampoo would have little hope of finding Ranma easily. Briefly she wondered where Nabiki was.<p>*******************<p>Back at the Masaki household...<p>Everyone had finished eating. While things were being cleaned up, Ranma took Katsuhito aside.<p>"Um... Katsuhito err Yosho err..." began Ranma.<p>"Please, just call me grandpa." said a smiling Katsuhito.<p>Nodding, Ranma said, "Ok. Um... Grandpa. I was wondering if it was ok if my mom and a couple other people stay here for a while."<p>Thinking about it a moment, Katsuhito nodded. "I do not mind. But why are they coming?"<p>Sighing, Ranma said, "Well, last night my late fiancee's older sister Nabiki tried to kill my mom. They are coming because I'm afraid they might get hurt if they stay in Nerima."<p>"Oh dear. In that case I must insist that they stay here." said Katsuhito.<p>Breathing a sigh of relief, Ranma said, "Thank you. Um... Could you not mention the part about Nabiki? Happosai knows but I don't want anyone to worry. Once they get here the story can be told."<p>Nodding, Katsuhito said, "Very well. I will not say anything."<p>Smiling, Ranma nodded before going to help Sasami clean up from breakfast.<p>Katsuhito watched her go before turning and going to the shrine. He had much to think about. Ranma's life sounded awful compared to anything he had ever seen. He would try to make sure that her stay there was enjoyable. It appeared she'd be there for quite awhile. Plus with the recent news of what happened to her mother. Well he'd try and be the wise elder that he tried to portray to everyone else.<p>*******************<p>Washu waited until everyone else began to go off to do their own things. Once things had cleared out, she stepped over to Cologne.<p>"Could I talk to you for a moment?" asked Washu.<p>Looking up at the young red head, Cologne nodded.<p>Hopping up on her staff, Cologne pogoed after Washu as she disappeared into a closet. Briefly, Cologne wondered where she went before Washu's head poked out and told her to come on. Shrugging, Cologne entered the closet only to come out in a wide open laboratory of some kind.<p>Cologne looked around in awe. "How?" she asked.<p>Smiling, Washu said, "This is just a pocket dimension I made. Nothing too hard for a genius of my caliber."<p>*A pocket dimension? That almost sounds like Mousse's hidden weapons technique. But on such a large scale! Amazing!* thought Cologne as she continued to stare in awe at the space around her.<p>Washu smiled to herself as Cologne was in awe of her work. She loved to watch the reactions of people that didn't know such things could exist.<p>"Shall we start?" said Washu.<p>Cologne simply nodded.<p>Reaching over, Washu tapped a few keys on a holographic terminal. Two chairs materialized. Each facing the other. Washu sat in one while Cologne made herself comfortable in the other.<p>Cologne regarded the young scientist for a moment. "What is it you wished to speak to me about?" she asked.<p>Leaning back, Washu smiled. "You seemed troubled at breakfast when Happosai walked in. Care to talk about it?"<p>"It is of no concern of yours. I doubt a child such as yourself could understand." said Cologne. She was trying to project her status of a superior elder.<p>Washu simply smirked and changed into her adult form. The reaction of Cologne was instantaneous.<p>Wide-eyed, Cologne asked, "How?"<p>Polishing her nails against her shirt, Washu said, "I am not as young as you might think."<p>Curious, Cologne asked, "How old are you?"<p>Smiling, Washu replied, "Well the farthest back I can remember is around twenty thousand years ago. Give or take a few hundred years."<p>By now Cologne's eyes were as wide as saucers. *Twenty thousand years! By my ancestor's. How is such a thing possible!* she thought.<p>Allowing some compassion to show through on her face, Washu leaned forward. "I know what you are thinking. And it's because I was able to invent way's of staying young that I still look like this. Sigh... I tend to stay in my younger body because of some bad memories associated with the one you see before you." said Washu.<p>Privately she thought, *Although since Ranma showed up, that pain seems to have lessened. I wonder why?*<p>Cologne assimilated the new information and nodded. "You don't have to remain that way if it upsets you that much."<p>Nodding, Washu reverted to her younger body. "Now, about my earlier question. What is bothering you?"<p>Sighing, Cologne decided to talk to the scientist. At her age it wasn't often you found someone that was older and could offer advice.<p>"I've lived a very long life. Longer than most people on this planet might live." said Cologne.<p>Nodding, Washu kept silent and let Cologne continue.<p>"Happi was the same way. Although I only recently learned he was Juraian and that was how he had lived for so long. But I didn't care. Aside from Yosho, Happi was one of my oldest friends." said Cologne.<p>Leaning forward while resting her elbows on her knees, Washu said, "And when he walked in, you didn't know what to think. Did you?"<p>Nodding, Cologne said, "Yes. I didn't know how to feel about it. A part of me was glad that Happi had regained what he lost all those years ago. But another part of me wanted my Happi back."<p>Smiling, Washu said softly, "You love him. Don't you?"<p>Leaning back as best she could, Cologne nodded. "Yes, I did. I still do actually. A very long time ago I met a young man that captured my heart. And now, three hundred years later he still has it."<p>Leaning back, Washu said, "What if I said I could help you? How would you feel about that?"<p>Looking up sharply, Cologne said, "Help me? But how?"<p>Smiling, Washu said, "As you can see, I am the greatest scientific genius in the universe. Reversing the aging process is child's play to someone of my abilities."<p>Wide eyed, Cologne said, "Then I would have to say I'd feel very grateful. However I'd have to ask what's in it for you."<p>"Nothing at all. I know what a love lost can feel like. It's not something I'd wish on anyone. I cannot help Ranma with his loss. However I can help you. That is, if you will allow me to." replied Washu.<p>Silently Cologne contemplated the offer presented to her. If what the redhead in front of her said was true, then she could be with Happi finally. She'd just have to make sure he didn't fall back onto his old habits. Although now that she knew the full truth behind why he did it, it did make some perverse sense. It was the only thing keeping him alive. Then again it was that same hobby that landed him in that situation in the first place. The more she thought about it, the better it sounded. She'd just have to make sure to find a way to prove who she was to the village elders. But that wouldn't prove too difficult.<p>Looking up at Washu, Cologne nodded. "Very well, I accept."<p>Smiling, Washu stood. "You won't regret it. Please, come with me."<p>Nodding, Cologne pogoed after Washu as she stepped deeper into the laboratory. She just hoped she made the right choice.<p>*******************<p>Meanwhile...<p>Sasami and Ranma worked in the kitchen to clean the dishes from earlier that morning. Sasami smiled as she worked, content that all was right in the world. Especially since her oneeniichan was helping her. Ranma however was happy to help. But she was still a little edgy over the previous evenings events concerning Nabiki and her mother. She'd be able to relax once her mother arrived.<p>"Thank for helping me with the dishes." said Sasami.<p>Smiling, Ranma replied, "It's no problem. I couldn't let you do this all by yourself."<p>Nodding, Sasami said, "It's alright. It's just the first time anyone's helped me."<p>"Oh? Why's that? I would think the others would help with the cooking and cleaning around here." said Ranma.<p>"Oh, they help with the cleaning of the house. But aside from me, only Grandpa, Tenchi, and Washu can cook easily." said Sasami.<p>"What about the others?" said Ranma.<p>Thinking a moment, Sasami replied, "Well, Ayeka and Ryoko can't cook that well. I think the last time they tried, it ended up eating half the house."<p>Blinking a moment, Ranma said, "Those two wouldn't happen to be related to anyone named Tendo would they?"<p>Shaking her head, Sasami said, "No, not that I know of. Why?"<p>Chuckling, Ranma said, "Well my late fiancee always thought she could do anything right on the first try. Even cooking. However every time she tried to cook something, it was either alive, glowing, a new form of poison, or all of the above."<p>"Wow, I'm glad Ryoko and Ayeka never met up with her then. I'm sorry you lost her." said Sasami.<p>Nodding, Ranma replied. "It's ok. I still love her even though she's gone. She meant alot to me and now I'll never get to tell her how I felt about her."<p>Hugging Ranma, Sasami said, "It's alright. You'll find someone to fall in love with again."<p>Returning the hug, Ranma looked down and smiled. "Thank you Sasami. That means alot to me. And I'm sure you're right."<p>Glad that she could help cheer up her oneeniichan, Sasami returned to the dishes with Ranma following close behind. Soon things were cleaned up and the two left the kitchen. Sasami, curious about what she saw earlier, began to head to Washu's Lab. Wondering where she was going, Ranma followed.<p>"Where ya going Sasami?" asked Ranma.<p>"I'm going to visit Washu. She and that lady Cologne went to talk after breakfast. I wanted to make sure she was alright." replied Sasami.<p>"Oh. Well then, why are you going to a broom closet?" asked Ranma.<p>"That's where Washu's lab is." replied Sasami.<p>"O... k..." said Ranma.<p>Sasami opened the door and stepped in. Ranma followed right behind her. Ranma was wondering why they were going into a broom closet. However, as soon as the door closed, Sasami opened another and stepped out into a large room filled with various scientific instruments. Ranma sort of gaped at the sight that surrounded her. How could so much fit in a broom closet?<p>"How?" asked Ranma.<p>Giggling, Sasami said, "Washu's a really smart scientist. She created this and connected it to the broom closet."<p>Before Ranma could respond, a voice came from within the lab. "I'm not just a really smart scientist you know. " she said as she emerged from a door that appeared out of nowhere.<p>"Oh? Then what are you?" asked Ranma.<p>"Why, I'm the greatest scientific genius in the universe!" said Washu just before she started to cackle.<p>"Err... Right..." replied Ranma, sweatdropping big time.<p>"So what can I do for you two?" asked Washu.<p>"I wanted to make sure Cologne was alright. She seemed a little down earlier." said Sasami.<p>Smiling, Washu motioned for the two to follow her. "She's fine Sasami. She was a little sad because of Happosai."<p>"Why?" asked Sasami.<p>Ranma just followed and listened. *Why would Cologne be sad because of Happosai?* he thought.<p>"Because she loves him and now that he is young again she feels that she has nobody left to grow old with." said Washu.<p>"That's so sad." said Sasami.<p>Ranma nodded.<p>"Don't worry about it too much. By noon, Cologne will be ready to reclaim her man." said Washu.<p>"How?" asked Sasami.<p>"Why by reversing the aging process of course! Nothing too difficult for a genius of my caliber!" said Washu.<p>"Oh Wow!" said Sasami.<p>"You can do that? But that's not possible. Is it?" said Ranma.<p>"It is very possible Ranma-dono. I didn't get to be twenty thousand years old by saying things were impossible."<p>"Twenty thousand! Whoa. And I thought Cologne and Happosai were old." said Ranma.<p>"Yes, well I'd prefer you don't hold my age against me. Oh, and by the way. Could you do something for me?" asked Washu.<p>"What's that?" replied Ranma.<p>"Could you call me Washu-chan?" said Washu.<p>Sweatdropping again, Ranma replied, "Um... Sure... Washu-chan."<p>"That's better. Now let's go check on Cologne." said Washu.<p>Nodding, Ranma and Sasami followed Washu deeper into the laboratory through a special subspace door. Moments after the door disappeared, a small black piglet walked past. It wondered how it got to New York before it turned a corner and disappeared.<p>*******************<p>Outside the lab, Happosai was busy relearning his body. It had been so many years since he was able to utilize many of the skills he'd learnt on Jurai. Slowly he began to work himself through several kata's. Each allowed him to get in touch with his body could do.<p>On the porch sat Katsuhito as he watched Happosai practice. He was curious as to how good the now youthened Juraian was. To survive without the power of Jurai and the water of life for so long was quite a testament to how innovative Happosai was. Katsuhito was curious and meant to test his skills against Happi sometime later.<p>Happi finished his unarmed kata's and turned to Katsuhito. "Could I borrow a bokken? I want to see if I still remember how to use a sword." said Happosai.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito rose and retrieved one form inside. Returning to the porch, he tossed it to Happi. Happosai caught it and began to run through some of the sword kata's he'd learnt centuries previous before going into ones of his own design.<p>As Happi worked himself through the kata's, Katsuhito analyzed him. *Hmm... He is slightly rusty but I can tell he once was a master of the sword. It seems father was right in appointing him as combat instructor to the palace guards. His technique is interesting though. Each kata flows into the next so smoothly. Some of them I don't recognize though. I will have to ask him about them later.* thought Katsuhito.<p>Happi had just finished running through the last of the kata's he designed for the sword. He was breathing a little harder than normal but otherwise he was still somewhat fresh. Turning, he stepped over to the porch to sit down.<p>Katsuhito turned to Happosai and said, "Very impressive. I can see now why father appointed you to teach the palace guards."<p>Nodding, Happosai wiped a small amount of sweat off his brow, "Yeah, but I'm still a bit out of shape. Normally this wouldn't have even winded me. Now, well lets just say I have to work on it some more. Gotta get used to using the power of Jurai rather than human life force." said Happi.<p>"Yes, I was meaning to ask you about that. How did you survive so long without access to the water of life or the power of Jurai?" asked Katsuhito.<p>Chuckling, Happi said, "Easy, before I was dropped on this planet, I had just developed several techniques that allowed me to absorb and utilize other forms of life energy. When I was dumped on this planet, I had to use them to get energy for my body. That was why I always groped girls and stole their underwear. I used that life force to keep myself alive."<p>"I thought you just did that for fun." chuckled Katsuhito.<p>"Oh I did it for that too. But most of the time I needed to energy to keep myself going. And at the time, there was no harm in an old man enjoying himself." said Happosai.<p>"Yes, well anyways, would it be possible for you to teach me those techniques?" asked Katsuhito.<p>"Why would you need to learn them? You are after all still fairly young despite what that disguise field shows everyone around you." said Happosai.<p>"How long have you known?" asked Katsuhito.<p>"Since I first saw you. I could feel it in use." replied Happi.<p>"My tree has taken root here and lost much of it's power." said Katsuhito.<p>"So why are you still young then?" asked Happi.<p>"At first I was curious as to why I was not aging. It turned out that Ryoko's gems were feeding power to my tree. In turn that provided me with energy. I'm still not sure how though. All I know is that Ryoko's gems give off a power that is similar to the power of Jurai." replied Katsuhito.<p>"Interesting. And what about now? Are they still providing power to your tree?" asked Happi.<p>"I have asked my tree about that. She has said that as long as there is one gem in the hilt of the master key, she will be provided with power. It turns out that my tree and the master key are more deeply linked than I previously thought." said Katsuhito.<p>"I will think about your request then. I'm sure that those gems will not stay in the master key forever." said Happi.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito said, "Yes. Tenchi has already returned one of the three gems to Ryoko. Eventually he will return the other two. However I cannot say when that will be."<p>"For now, I will only teach those techniques along with all my others to my heir." said Happosai.<p>"I take it that Ranma is your heir?" asked Katsuhito.<p>Nodding, Happi replied, "Yes. The boy has a gift for the art. Something I haven't seen in many years. I know he will do me proud."<p>"I agree. He was able to keep up with Ryoko and that is not something anyone can do." said Katsuhito.<p>"Yes. I believe Cologne has also taken him on as her heir. The boy will be a force to be reckoned with when his training is complete." said Happosai<p>"He is a good choice to hold that knowledge. He appears to have a kind heart like his mother." said Katsuhito.<p>"Indeed. I always wondered why the boy never turned out like Genma. Now I know." said Happosai.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito said, "Yes. From the description of this Genma, I do not care very much for him."<p>"I agree. He was good at the art, but his greed perverted it. I am glad that the child of our goddess did not turn out like him." said Happosai.<p>"Agreed." replied Katsuhito.<p>*******************<p>Back at the Lab...<p>Washu, Sasami, and Ranma stepped out of a subspace door into a large room with several large glass tubes sitting in it. All of them were dark with the exception of one. In it floated Cologne, a breath mask strapped to her face, Her face was down and her eyes were closed. She appeared to be sleeping. No longer was she a shriveled up woman. Now she appeared to be around her mid 70's. Her modesty was kept intact by bands of metal that wrapped around the central part of the tube.<p>Ranma looked upon the tube for a moment before turning to Washu. "What's going on?" she asked.<p>Smiling, Washu said, "Thats simple Ranma-dono. The liquid is a combination of proteins, nano technology, and energy similar to the water of life. Once its finished, she will be around the same age as Happosai. She'll also age around the same rate as he will."<p>Nodding, Ranma turned back toward the tube. She wondered briefly how to present Cologne to Happosai. Let alone try to get them together like Sasami and Washu had hinted at in their travel to the room they were in.<p>Sasami watched as Cologne visibly reduced in age. Turning toward Washu, Sasami asked, "When is she gonna be ready?"<p>"I'd say she'll be all done around noon." replied Washu.<p>Glancing over at Washu, Ranma said, "Hey, Washu-chan?"<p>"Yes Ranma-dono?" said Washu.<p>"I was wondering if you could do something for me." said Ranma.<p>"Oh? What would that be?" inquired Washu.<p>"Well my body is undergoing physical changes so that I can use my power better since I'm not fully Jurian. I was wondering if you could tell me if they've finished or if I should expect more. My mom said something about human DNA allowing me to become more powerful than I was full Jurian." said Ranma.<p>Thinking a moment, Washu nodded, "I can do that easily enough. I've been curious as to why your power is hard to detect as well."<p>Curious, Ranma said, "It is? I didn't know that."<p>"Oh yes, your power is very hard to detect. Before you came here, I was only able to detect it when it flared up. Now I can just barely detect it when it's idle. But enough of that. Let's run those tests and check you out." said Washu.<p>Nodding, Ranma followed Washu over to a nearby examination table. Sitting down on it, Ranma watched as Washu snapped her fingers. Her clothing changed from what she normally wore to a nurses uniform.<p>"Now let's begin our examination." said Washu as she began with standard tests that might be run in any conventional doctor's office.<p>Sasami simply watched to make sure Washu didn't hurt her oneeniichan.<p>*******************<p>Outside...<p>Azaka and Kamidake watched as a young man walked toward the Masaki compound. Running scans, the two guardians determined that the young man was carrying an unusual amount of weaponry. As he neared, the two guardians fulfilled their function. To protect the royal family from potential dangers.<p>Mousse slowly approached the two guardians. Something was off, but he could not figure out what it was. He was briefly curious as to what the two large logs were. They were unusual in his book.<p>Shrugging it off, Mousse stepped between the logs. Suddenly, his danger sense flared. But it was too late. Azaka and Kamidake had activated their holding beams.<p>"Hey! Let me go!" yelled Mousse.<p>"Sorry, but we cannot do that. You are carrying an unusual amount of weaponry. We must deliver you to Lord Katsuhito." said Azaka.<p>"What the heck are you things! Release me at once!" yelled Mousse.<p>"Let us deliver him to Lord Katsuhito." said Kamidake.<p>"Agreed." said Azaka.<p>The two guardians floated into the air and made their way to the Masaki house while Mousse continued to try and break free of whatever it was that was holding him. In a matter of moments, the two guardians descended onto the yard just outside the Masaki household.<p>Katsuhito looked up to see Azaka and Kamidake detaining someone. Curious, he stood up to find out what was going on. Happosai followed right behind the old priest. He wondered why Mousse was here.<p>"What's that idiot doing here?" asked Happi. More to himself than anyone else.<p>Hearing that Happosai knew the boy that was being detained, Katsuhito asked, "Do you know him?"<p>Turning to Katsuhito, Happosai nodded, "Yes I do. His name is Mousse. He's a rival of Ranma's. One of the amazons."<p>Nodding, Katsuhito turned back to the two guardians, "What is going on?" he asked.<p>"This young man was caught entering the grounds carrying an unusually large amount of weaponry. We decided to hold him and bring him to you." said Azaka.<p>Glancing at Mousse, Katsuhito said, "Release him."<p>"As you command." said Kamidake.<p>The field holding Mousse disappeared. Unable to right himself, Mousse fell to the ground on his head. Getting to his feet, he glared at the two logs before they returned to their posts.<p>Katsuhito regarded the young man in front of him. *The boy appears to know a bit about fighting. But I wonder what Azaka and Kamidake meant by large amounts of weaponry. It doesn't look like he could hold more than a few small melee weapons in that robe of his. Only one way to find out.* he thought.<p>"Excuse me." said Katsuhito.<p>Broken out of his thoughts of making the guardians into firewood, Mousse turned toward Katsuhito. "Eh?" said Mousse.<p>Smiling, Katsuhito said, "Now that I have your attention, could you tell me why you were carrying weapons onto the shrine grounds?"<p>"Who are you?" asked Mousse.<p>"I am Katsuhito Masaki, the owner and keeper of the Masaki Shrine. Now I'd like to know what Azaka and Kamidake were saying about large amounts of weaponry on your person." said Katsuhito.<p>"I'm a master of Hidden Weapons. The weapons are part of my style of martial arts. Why?" replied Mousse.<p>"I just want to make sure the residents are kept safe." said Katsuhito.<p>"Don't worry. I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'm looking for a woman named Cologne. Do you know if she is here?" said Mousse.<p>"And what do you want with Cologne boy. Last I heard, you were supposed to be keeping an eye on Shampoo." said Happosai.<p>Looking over at the other man, Mousse said, "Who are you?"<p>Chuckling, Happosai said, "Oh I'm hurt. Don't tell me you don't remember me, Happosai."<p>"You're too young and tall to be that old lecher." said Mousse before receiving a knock on his head form the bokken Happosai was holding.<p>"Watch your mouth boy. I'll have you know that I'm young again thanks to Ranma undoing something that was done to me three hundred years ago." said Happosai.<p>"I'll believe it when I hear it from Ranma. Now where is Cologne. I have to talk to her." said Mousse.<p>"She's inside with another resident of the shrine. As long as you promise not to harm anyone, you can come in." said Katsuhito.<p>"I promise I won't hurt anyone. Now can you take me to Cologne." said Mousse.<p>"Alright. Follow me." said Katsuhito.<p>Mousse followed Katsuhito while Happosai kept back with Mousse.<p>"Behave yourself boy. I won't have you attacking Ranma anymore because you think he's after Shampoo." said Happosai.<p>"You know an awful lot. What's Ranma been telling you." said Mousse, still doubtful of Happosai's claim.<p>"I told you boy. I'm Happosai. And if you still don't believe me, then ask me something only Happosai would know." said Happi.<p>Thinking a moment, Mousse asked, "Ok. How many pairs of Shampoo's panties have you stolen?"<p>Mousse was confident this man wouldn't know this little bit of information. Not even Ranma knew how many of Shampoo's panties had been stolen by Happosai. However Mousse knew. He'd kept track in order to be able to enact his revenge for Shampoo upon the old lecher.<p>"Twenty Seven. The last pair were a lovely silky pair with persian cats on them." replied Happosai.<p>His jaw hanging down, Mousse said, "How could you know that! Not even Ranma knows that."<p>"I told you already, I'm Happosai. Now if you are done questioning who I am, let's go find Cologne so you can tell her why you are here and not watching the Nekohanten and Shampoo." said Happosai.<p>"So you really are Happosai. You look... different." said Mousse.<p>"I'll say. Ranma was able to undo something someone did to me long ago. Now that it's been undone, I've regained my original appearance." said Happosai.<p>"What did you do?" asked Mousse.<p>"I'd rather not talk about it." said Happosai.<p>Nodding, Mousse said, "Alright. I won't pry."<p>"Let's go find Cologne. And remember, no attacking Ranma." said Happosai.<p>"Don't worry. I don't want to fight him. I want to apologize to him and ask him for his friendship." said Mousse.<p>Happi simply nodded.<p>The three entered the house in search of Cologne, willing subject of the mad scientist Washu. Also known to most as... Washu-chan, the greatest scientific genius in the universe!<p>*******************<p>Not too far away...<p>A train pulled into the station closest to the Masaki shrine. The train station was close but still far enough to require a period of walking. As the train slowed down, three particular passengers began to get ready to disembark.<p>"Do you have everything Kasumi? How about you Ukyo?" asked Nodoka.<p>Pulling down a small suitcase from an overhead shelf, Kasumi nodded, "Yes Auntie."<p>Ukyo nodded as well. "I have everything together as well Auntie."<p>"Very well. From what I know, we'll have to walk to the shrine. It's located fairly close but still far enough to warrant a considerable walk." said Nodoka.<p>The train finished stopping and the doors opened with a whoosh. Passengers began to file out and onto the station's walkway. Soon, the three women stepped off the train. Looking around a moment, the three began to make their way off the platform and into the main station.<p>As the three stepped out of the main building of the train station, they looked about the small town in front of them. People could be seen walking around the streets. Peddlers could be seen by the sidewalks selling various items such as fruits and such.<p>Making sure they had a good grip on their bags, the three women began their trek to the shrine. They remained relatively quiet until they reached the countryside.<p>Kasumi was the first to speak since the three left the train station. "I do hope father and uncle are going to be ok. I hate to leave them all alone with Nabiki doing such a horrible thing." said a worried Kasumi.<p>"It's alright dear. I left a note for them about what happened. They should be able to take care of themselves." said Nodoka trying to reassure Kasumi.<p>"If those two can't defend themselves against Nabiki, then some martial artists they are. Frankly, I wonder why you married Genma. He doesn't seem the type to have someone fall for him." said Ukyo.<p>Smiling a little at Ukyo, Nodoka said, "I understand if you find it hard to believe. When I first met him, he could hardly speak to me without blushing. He was incredibly shy but he eventually outgrew his shyness and began to court me. We were both young and I was naive about the world. Boys didn't approach me because they were afraid of me. I was quite skilled with a sword back then."<p>"So he was the first to show an interest in you? That's why you married him?" asked Ukyo.<p>Kasumi simply kept silent and listened.<p>Nodding, Nodoka said, "Yes, you could say that. He would bring me flowers and candy. He really impressed me when he stood up to Happosai one time. Happosai had tried to grope me but Genma stopped him and tried to defend my honor. It was the only time I had seen him stand up to his master."<p>"Yeah, well I still say he's messed up Ranchan's life with all those engagements and dangerous training methods." said Ukyo.<p>"Uncle can be a bit enthusiastic about his teaching methods." added Kasumi.<p>"Yes, I was quite disturbed to hear about some of the ways he taught my child. Forcing him to run from wolves to become faster. Trying to teach him to steal from people. And worst of all, tossing him into a pit of starving cats." said Nodoka.<p>"I still can't believe that one. What kind of sick twisted bastard does that to a child?" said Ukyo.<p>"I'm afraid that was a bit far." said Kasumi.<p>"Yes, well what's more is that training caused my son's heritage to be sealed." said Nodoka.<p>Curious, Ukyo asked, "What heritage?"<p>Smiling at the two girls, Nodoka said, "Well, as you recall from last night, Ranma does not have a father. He is not fully human and the part of his makeup that comes from beyond the stars is gifted with extraordinary power. However the Neko-ken sealed that heritage until Jusenkyo where the prison it was kept in began to crack. It wasn't until Saffron struck down poor Akane that the prison shattered and his heritage burst forth. My son told me that if he had not been trained in the Neko-ken, he would have been able to save Akane easily."<p>"You mean because of uncle, Ranma couldn't save Akane in time?" asked Kasumi.<p>"That's the way it sounds to me sugar. Frankly, I can't see any reason you stay married to him." said Ukyo while giving Kasumi a much needed supportive hug with her free arm.<p>"Well then you'll be happy to know that as of noon today, I will be a single woman." said Nodoka.<p>Quickly turning toward Nodoka, Kasumi said, "Oh my."<p>"If you ask me sugar, it's about time. That man doesn't deserve someone like Auntie." said Ukyo.<p>"Well I suppose you do have a point Ukyo. But still..." replied Kasumi.<p>"Don't worry about it dear. It's something I've talked with my son about and he supports my decision." said Nodoka.<p>"Will you begin dating again Auntie?" asked Ukyo.<p>Thinking about it a moment, Nodoka replied, "We'll see. I've lived alone for a little over ten years. I am entitled to find someone who is kind and caring while being strong and manly."<p>Ukyo and Kasumi sweatdropped.<p>"But I doubt I'll find someone like that around here. Afterall, we are going to be staying at a shrine." said Nodoka.<p>As Nodoka said this, the three approached the entrance to the valley where the Masaki shrine was located.<p>*******************<p>Somewhere nearby a man sneezed.<p>*******************<p>Meanwhile...<p>Back in Nerima, Shampoo kept looking for Nodoka, Kasumi, and Ukyo. However the three were nowhere to be found. They were not on any of the recent trains that had been departing when she arrived. Unfortunately for Shampoo, she was quite a bit late in making it to the train station. Most likely due to the fact that her three targets had left at such an early hour.<p>Getting angry, Shampoo left the train station and headed back to the Nekohanten.<br/>If she couldn't find them the old fashioned way, she'd just have to see if there was something in her Great Grandmother's stuff that would allow her to find her Airen. She was sure there would be something that could help her.<p>Unbeknownst to her, someone was watching her as she searched for a way to find her Airen. However the person watching her was not located nearby.<p>*******************<p>Back at Washu's Laboratory...<p>Washu had just finished running her scans of Ranma's female body. She really wanted to go over the results of the tests she had run, however due to Ranma's complex makeup from the odd circumstances which brought her forth into the world, she'd have to wait a while before finding out the answers to her many questions.<p>"There, all done. I should have the results in a couple hours." said Washu<p>"Why so long?" asked Sasami.<p>Smiling, Washu said, "It's because Ranma-dono has a very complex makeup due to how she was born. My computers will take a while analyzing all that data. Especially when you factor in Ranma's curse and intense physical conditioning from all the martial arts she practices."<p>Just thinking of something new, Sasami said, "I wanna see my oneeniichan as a boy!"<p>Smiling at the exuberant princess, Washu turned to Ranma, "Care to oblige?" she asked.<p>Returning the smile, Ranma nodded, "Sure, all I need is some hot water."<p>"Easily done." said Washu before typing something into her holographic computer terminal. Instantly a container of hot water fell out of a hole in subspace and into Washu's hand. Tossing it to Ranma, Washu said, "There ya go."<p>Catching the container, Ranma nodded, "Thanks."<p>Opening the container, Ranma poured some of the water over her head. Instantly the usual change took place. The red hair turned black while the silvery blue remained. Ranma's form grew taller and more muscular. Ranma's breasts disappeared and were replaced by a firm masculine chest. Once it was done, Ranma glanced at the two spectators. Sasami seemed to be looking at him with fascination. Glancing over at Washu, he could see an odd gleam in her eyes.<p>"Oh wow! That was so cool!" said Sasami.<p>Washu simply looked at him while having this strange urge to press that special button on her laptop. It was a simple button that basically meant that she'd found a new guinea pig and they were not getting away. It's function was to detain said guinea pig by several robotic arms and other highly questionable bondage devices.<p>About that time, Ryo-Ohki hopped in looking for her new friend. She hoped her mama wasn't doing anything bad to her new friend. She really liked Ranma and for some odd reason felt drawn to her.<p>Looking around, Ryo-Ohki spotted Sasami, Washu, and some boy she'd never seen before. He reminded her of Ranma and she felt drawn to him. Shrugging it off for the time being, Ryo-Ohki hopped up and miyahh'd.<p>{"Hello!"} said Ryo-Ohki. Only Ranma truly understanding what she said.<p>Glancing down, Ranma saw Ryo-Ohki looking up at him. Smiling, he said, "Hey Ryo-Ohki. How ya doing?"<p>Tilting her head, Ryo-Ohki asked, {"Who are you?"}<p>Chuckling, Ranma said, "I'm Ranma. Remember, I told you about the curse that changes me into a female with cold water and a male with hot water. Well, this is my male form."<p>Still a little doubtful, Ryo-Ohki said, {"Prove it."}<p>"Ok" said Ranma.<p>Checking the water left in the container which had cooled down enough to cause the change, Ranma dumped it over his head. The usual change took place and soon stood a female Ranma in place of the male Ranma.<p>Wide eyed, Ryo-Ohki said, {"So it was true! Amazing!"}<p>"Yes it is. I just hope you aren't too freaked out about it." said Ranma. She really didn't want to lose her new friend because of her curse.<p>Shaking her little head, Ryo-Ohki said, {"I'm not freaked out about it. I turn into a spaceship myself."}<p>"Really? Cool." said Ranma.<p>As the two kept talking, Washu began to develop a twitch in one of her typing fingers. *Ranma can talk to Ryo-Ohki without any kind of link. Must not press special button. Must not trap and perform many experiments on him. Must keep control. This is Tsunami's child. Must not harm in any way. Must resist urges.* she thought.<p>Sasami sighed, still a little dejected since she couldn't talk to Ryo-Ohki like her oneeniichan could. Turning to Washu, Sasami watched fascinated as the red headed scientist refrained from performing her usual tests on Ranma. An amazing sight indeed.<p>Ranma picked up Ryo-Ohki and turned to Washu. A little worried about the obvious twitching of her finger, Ranma asked, "Are you alright?"<p>Broken out of her mental mantra, Washu turned to Ranma, "Yes... Yes I am. Tell me, how can you talk to Ryo-Ohki? Only myself and Ryoko could communicate with her and that was because of a special telepathic link we share. It's not perfect but it does allow for some communication. Not much I'm afraid." she said.<p>"Well as far as I can figure, it's cause of a technique I learned called the Neko-ken. Don't ask me about it. I don't really like talking about it." replied Ranma.<p>Nodding, Washu said, "Yes, the people that accompanied you mentioned it to me and Katsuhito the other night right after you and Sasami left."<p>"Um... yeah... well don't mention it to anybody else. It's not something I like telling people. Sasami knows but only because I didn't want her trying to find out about it from some other source." said Ranma, slightly upset with Cologne and Happosai but not too much. After all, it wasn't a weakness anymore for him.<p>"I won't talk about it to anyone." said Washu.<p>"Me either." interjected Sasami.<p>Cradling Ryo-Ohki in her arms while petting that oh so special spot that melted Ryo-Ohki, Ranma asked, "So when's Cologne gonna be done?"<p>Glancing over at the tube which held a now youthful looking Cologne, Washu said, "She should be done fairly soon."<p>Nodding, Ranma said, "Alright, I suppose we should wait then."<p>"Agreed. And while we are waiting, I can perform some tests on your male form!" said Washu.<p>"Um... Alright... I guess..." said Ranma.<p>And so, Washu began her examination of Ranma's male form once she got him some more warm water. Sasami sat down on a nearby box and watched Ranma's examination, making sure that Washu wouldn't take advantage of her oneeniichan. Ryo-Ohki snuggled deeper into Ranma's embrace while Washu worked. Thoughts of her, Ranma, and mountains of carrots began to creep into her mind. She sighed in contentment.<p>*******************<p>Across the universe...<p>Tokimi watched as her newest pawn learned how to use the power she had imbued into them. The girl, Nabiki as she was named, was grasping the concepts of harnessing the power of Tokimi quite easily.<p>Tokimi smiled and thought, *I was right in recruiting her. Her sharp mind is similar in many ways to my sister. She can easily grasp new concepts and utilize them soon after. Perhaps she might just survive long enough to see my rise to ultimate power once I get the powers of my sisters and my wayward nephew/niece.*<p>Looking back at Nabiki's training, Tokimi watched as D3 continued Nabiki's instruction of the powers granted to her.<p>"Concentrate. Let Lady Tokimi's power flow through you. Do not force it and it will come to you." said D3 mentally.<p>Nodding, Nabiki concentrated on what was described to her. Her teacher, D3, had showed her something called the Light Hawk Wings. A tool used by one of Lady Tokimi's sisters. The one that was one of Ranma's mothers.<p>That had come as quite a shock to her but she assimilated the information and filed it away for future plans of revenge. For now she concentrated on using the power granted to her by Lady Tokimi to create something similar to the Light Hawk Wings.<p>D3 watched while Nabiki tried to figure out how to create Lady Tokimi's version of the Light Hawk Wings. The girl his mistress had recruited was a quick study and had easily learned some of the minor aspects Lady Tokimi's power had given her. Just that morning he'd shown the girl in front of him how to teleport and levitate. Once she felt how it was done, she was able to replicate it not long after. She still had a long way to go before she could do either instinctively but he was sure she'd be able to. It appeared that she only needed to feel how something was done in order to replicate it. But he could not show her the wings since he himself could not generate them.<p>From a shadowed doorway, a man watched Nabiki's training. His form was hidden in the shadows and so far he had not been noticed. He was curious about this new disciple of Lady Tokimi. She was gifted with less power than himself, however her lack of power was more than made up in her quick mind and adaptability. He'd seen her learn to teleport and levitate earlier and was somewhat astounded at how quick she picked it up. It took him nearly three days to figure out teleportation and another day after that to finally figure out levitation. This girl intrigued him and he wanted to learn more about her.<p>Still unable to figure out how to form the wings, Nabiki let out a frustrated sigh. Looking up at the large floating head, Nabiki said, "I still can't figure out how to do it. Can't you show me them so I can figure them out better?"<p>"No I cannot. The wings are not one of the powers my lady has gifted me with. You will have to figure them out on your own." said D3 mentally.<p>Sighing again, Nabiki asked, "Well can she show me. Or is there anyone here are gifted with the ability for form the wings?"<p>"Lady Tokimi cannot show you. To do so would destroy your body just from the power behind them. However there is another that can show you." said D3 mentally.<p>Raising an eyebrow, Nabiki asked, "Oh? Who might that be?"<p>Before D3 could respond, the man in the shadows stepped out and replied, "That would be me."<p>Turning quickly, Nabiki fell into a loose fighting stance she'd learnt when she was younger. Her modified body easily moved into the position as best she remembered it. Scanning the room, she was met with the sight of a man walking toward her. His muscles moved as he walked with a grace that spoke of great power. She knew enough about fighters to know that this guy was one.<p>The man stopped a few feet from her, his body language saying that he didn't consider her a threat. She relaxed slightly but still kept her guard up. As the man smiled, she wondered if he was approving of her in some way. Sizing him up, she looked him over carefully. He was tall with a toned fighters body and a handsome face. His hair was a sandy brown and his eyes were the same shade of green as her new ones. She wondered briefly if this was due to the power Lady Tokimi had granted them. The power radiating off the man in front of her confirmed her guess that he had been imbued with the same power. However his was much stronger than her own.<p>"Nabiki, meet Ramsus. Ramsus, this is Nabiki. She was just recently gifted by Lady Tokimi." said D3 mentally.<p>Bowing slightly, Ramsus said, "A pleasure."<p>"I'm sure it's all yours." replied Nabiki with a smirk.<p>Still smiling, Ramsus said, "I couldn't help but observe that you are having problems forming the wings."<p>Her smirk fading slightly, Nabiki said, "Yeah, well D3 can't show me the wings and it's hard to figure out how to summon them without at least seeing them in action."<p>"Perhaps I could help you in your training. I'm sure that it would go much faster if I could show you the things that D3 cannot." replied Ramsus.<p>Thinking about it a moment, Nabiki looked up at D3, "What do you think?" she asked.<p>"Ramsus would be more suited to training you in certain areas than I. The use of the wings being one of several areas that I cannot easily instruct you in." replied D3 mentally.<p>Nodding, Nabiki turned back to Ramsus and thought about it further. Finally coming to a decision, Nabiki smirked and said, "Alright then, show me these wings."<p>Smiling, Ramsus stepped back a few feet, "Now watch closely." he said as he began to summon the wings. Slowly five wings of energy began to appear in front of him. As they fully emerged, Ramsus smiled.<p>Studying the way Ramsus did it, Nabiki concentrated and felt her way through summoning the wings. She knew she could feel the ways Lady Tokimi's power was focused to accomplish the things she had been taught. Now she used that same ability to replicate the way Ramsus had summoned the wings. Nothing happened at first however slowly a single wing began to form. Sweat began to form on her forehead as she concentrated harder. As soon as the wing fully formed, Nabiki released the power, falling to her knees panting as the wing vanished.<p>"That took more out of me than I thought." she said offhandedly.<p>Kneeling down, Ramsus put a hand on her shoulder. When her eyes met his, he smiled and said, "Don't worry about it. The first time is always the hardest. In time you will be able to call forth more than one wing as well as be able to sustain them longer."<p>Nodding, Nabiki allowed Ramsus to help her up. Once standing again, Nabiki smiled at Ramsus, "So, do you do this with all the people that are gifted by Lady Tokimi?" she asked.<p>Shaking his head, Ramsus replied, "No, as far as I know, you and I are the only ones she has gifted in this manner."<p>"You are correct Ramsus. You two are my lady's chosen warriors. Soon your time shall come to fulfill her wishes. Until that time, you shall train in your power and become stronger." said D3 mentally.<p>Lady Tokimi's image appeared behind D3. Seeing this, Nabiki and Ramsus stood at attention beside each other facing the image.<p>Looking down at her chosen warriors, Lady Tokimi smiled, "You learn your powers well Nabiki." she said.<p>"Thank you my lady. Your words are most kind." replied Nabiki.<p>"Ramsus, you shall teach her all you know of combat. You and her are now partners. Together you shall fulfill your duty to me." said Tokimi.<p>Both Ramsus and Nabiki bowed while replying, "Yes my lady."<p>"D3." said Tokimi.<p>"Yes my lady?" replied D3<p>"Continue to train them. I want them ready within the month." said Tokimi.<p>"It shall be done my lady." replied D3<p>The image of Tokimi faded away as D3 turned to face Nabiki and Ramsus.<p>"Practice your teleportation and levitation Nabiki. You are still weak from forming the wing." said D3 mentally.<p>"As you wish." replied Nabiki.<p>Turning to Ramsus, D3 said mentally, "Help her to learn how to use her power more instinctively. Also, begin her training in combat techniques. How you teach her is up to you."<p>Nodding, Ramsus said, "Very well."<p>As D3 disappeared, leaving only the red gem from his forehead behind, Ramsus turned to Nabiki. In return, Nabiki turned to Ramsus.<p>"Shall we eat before we resume our training?" asked Ramsus.<p>Nodding, Nabiki said, "That sounds good."<p>As Ramsus and Nabiki strolled out of the training chamber, Tokimi watched and smiled. Her two champion's would make an excellent team. She wondered briefly if they would pursue a more intimate partnership than what currently existed. However that thought was dismissed as unimportant to her. She had other things to worry about.<p>Lately she had been unable to watch what was going on in the Masaki compound. Somehow the arrival of her nephew/niece had blocked her attempts to keep track of her sisters. The only way she knew this could be accomplished was if her nephew/niece had grown in power. It was hard enough to watch her nephew/niece the first few times. But as his/her power grew, her power to watch them diminished.<p>She frowned at this aspect. She knew that her nephew/niece's power would grow, but it appeared it was growing faster than she had predicted. There was some other factor at work here. Something she hadn't figured into the equation. But what could it be? She frowned as she continued to ponder this latest piece of information.<p>*******************<p>Back at the Masaki compound...<p>Katsuhito sat at the head of the dining table sipping tea. Across from him sat Happosai while to his right, Mousse sat drinking his own cup of tea.<p>"So where is Cologne." asked Mousse once again.<p>"She should be here shortly. I've informed Washu that a visitor is here to see Cologne. However I do not know for certain when she will arrive."<p>"I suppose I can wait then." replied Mousse.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito took another sip of his tea.<p>*******************<p>In Washu's Lab...<p>Sitting up, Ranma breathed a sigh of relief as Washu finished examining his male form. Finally he could put his clothes back on. It wasn't that he minded being naked. It was just that look that crossed Washu's eyes occasionally that made him want to cover up.<p>In his lap, a furry little creature let out a contented miyahh. Glancing down, Ranma smirked and pet Ryo-Ohki some more. He liked the little cabbit that had taken a shine to him.<p>"There, all done Ranma-dono. I'll let you know what I find out once my computers finish analyzing the data." said Washu.<p>Nodding, Ranma hopped down from the examination table. Buttoning up his shirt, he glanced over at the tube in which Cologne was floating. It appeared that she was nearly done. Where once was a very very old woman, now floated a young woman. She appeared to be around thirty-five with long purple hair. She appeared a little older than when he had first seen her in a young body.<p>Washu glanced at her terminal as a beep signaled she had a message. Reading through it, an eyebrow rose. *So, Cologne has a visitor. I'll have to inform her when she gets out. Hmm... I wonder who it could be.* she thought.<p>Just as she was about to activate several cameras within the house, the sound of a cooking timer going ding alerted her to the end of Cologne's regeneration.<p>"Did I just hear an oven timer go ding?" asked Ranma.<p>"I heard it too." said Sasami.<p>Smiling, Washu said, "That just means that Cologne is done."<p>"But a oven timer? I mean, she's not some kind of dinner cooking in an oven." said Ranma.<p>Chuckling a little, Washu replied, "Actually in some ways she is. However it was the most convenient thing to use. Anyhow, let's get her out of there. The fluids are almost done draining."<p>Nodding, Ranma turned back toward the tube which held Cologne. As soon as all the fluid drained out of the tube, Washu typed a few things into her terminal. Cologne was wrapped in a nimbus of light. Once it disappeared, she appeared to have been washed, dried, and clothed. Pressing another key, Washu opened the tube.<p>"Ranma, pick her up and lay her down on the table." said Washu.<p>Nodding, Ranma stepped forward and picked up Cologne. Turning, he moved over to the table and laid her down. Washu stepped forward to remove the breathing mask which was still strapped to Cologne's face.<p>As Cologne lay on the table, Ranma stepped back to stand next to Sasami. Absently he pet the cabbit which was riding on his shoulder while Washu went about waking up the sleeping beauty.<p>Slowly Cologne returned to consciousness. She could hear several sounds that told her she was in some kind of facility. Her eyes slowly opened to be met with the face of a red head in a nurse's uniform.<p>A little weakly she asked, "What am I doing in the hospital?"<p>Smiling, Washu said, "You're not in the hospital. You're in my lab. Remember?"<p>Blinking a little, the memories came back to her. Her talk with the woman named Washu. The promise of renewed youth so she could be with Happi.<p>"I remember. But why do I feel so weak?" said Cologne.<p>"It's alright. You feel weak because the process took alot out of you. You should be able to move about in a few moments." replied Washu.<p>Nodding as best she could, Cologne asked, "Did it work?"<p>Smiling, Washu replied, "Yes it did. And I must say that you turned out better than I had hoped! Let's get you up and about so you can get used to your new body as well as get your man."<p>Smiling a little, Cologne slowly sat up. Sitting at the edge of the table, she looked over at Sasami and Ranma a moment before turning back to Washu, "Can I see?".<p>Nodding, Washu typed a few things into her terminal. Moments later a mirror appeared nearby.<p>Stepping forward, Ranma helped Cologne stand up and move over to the mirror. As her reflection came into view, Cologne smiled. Happy that it had worked, she gazed at her reflection a little longer before turning to Ranma, "Thank you Ranma but I'd like to try standing on my own."<p>Nodding, Ranma let her stand under her own power while remaining close just in case.<p>Able to stand under her own power, Cologne checked her profile out in the mirror again. She was just as beautiful as she remembered. Turning to Washu, Cologne said, "Thank you."<p>"It was no problem." said Washu.<p>Still a little weak, Cologne tried to return to the table to sit and replenish her energy. However she stumbled a little only to find Ranma there in an instant to help her.<p>"Don't push yourself too hard. You still need to get used to that body." said Ranma.<p>"Thank you Ranma." said Cologne as she allowed him to help her to the table.<p>Typing a few things into her terminal, a portal appeared above her. A bottle of some some kind of watery liquid dropped out and fell into her hand.<p>"Here, drink this. It should help replenish your energy." she said, handing the bottle to Cologne.<p>Nodding, Cologne opened it and began to drink. As soon as she was done, she began to feel a bit stronger than before as her lost energy returned to her.<p>Curious, she asked, "What was it?"<p>"Oh nothing much. Just a water based energy replenishment drink I invented. I call it Washu's brand energy replenisher. I was going to call it Gatorade but someone on earth beat me to the name. Oh well, the life of a genius is fraught with peril." replied Washu.<p>Blinking a couple times at the all too familiar saying, Ranma said, "O... k... So is Cologne going to be okay?"<p>"Yep. She'll just have to get used to being taller. Probably will have to get used to a few other things as well." said Washu with a wink towards Cologne at the end.<p>Getting the meaning behind the wink, Cologne blushed a little. "So is there anything I need to know about my return to youth?" she asked.<p>Thinking a moment, Washu nodded, "Yes there is. Right now you would be around thirty to thirty five years old. Your body is capable of having children and you will age the same as any Jurian."<p>Blinking a moment, Cologne asked, "I won't age like a normal human? Why?"<p>Chuckling, Washu replied, "Well if you plan to pursue a relationship with Happosai, you'll need to be able to live as long as him."<p>Nodding, Cologne asked, "How did you make it so I'd age that slow?"<p>"Simple really. I just spliced in some Juraian DNA to your genetic structure. You're still yourself and all your genes are untouched, you just have some Juraian in you now. Which reminds me. Ranma, talk to your mother and see if it's possible for Cologne to use the Power of Jurai." said Washu.<p>While Cologne took the new information in, Ranma nodded, "Ok, I'll probably see her later today or tonight. I could link Cologne to my own power but I'd rather not have anything or anyone else linked to my power."<p>"You mean there is something that is tied to your own power?" asked a curious Washu.<p>"Just a sword I made with the light hawk wings for my mother before I left. I'm glad I made it for her too." said Ranma.<p>"A sword eh? An interesting use for the light hawk wings." said Washu, visions of experimentation on a sword dancing in her head.<p>Turning to Ranma, Cologne said, "As soon as I get used to my new body, I'll be able to begin your instruction as my heir. For now, I'd like to get back to the house and eat. It must be getting close to lunch time."<p>Gasping, Sasami said, "I almost forgot! I still have to make lunch!"<p>"Alright. Let's get back then. I am getting a bit hungry myself and we still need to introduce Cologne to Happosai." said Washu.<p>"Do you have anything I can wear besides these?" asked Cologne indicating the jeans and shirt she was clothed in.<p>Nodding, Washu asked, "What would you like?"<p>Thinking a moment, Cologne said, "Probably something like what Ranma is wearing."<p>Typing a few things into her terminal, Washu input Cologne's request. A moment later, Cologne was dressed in an outfit similar to what Ranma was wearing only the shirt was green instead of red.<p>Looking down at herself, Cologne nodded. "I can see why you wear these Ranma. They are very comfortable."<p>"Yeah they are. Anyways, let's get going. Sasami still has lunch to make and I'd like to help her make it." said Ranma.<p>"You mean it!" said an excited Sasami.<p>Smiling, Ranma nodded, "Yep. I can show you a few tricks too."<p>Crying with delight, Sasami hugged Ranma and began to drag him toward the subspace door to the house.<p>Chuckling, Cologne and Washu followed right behind them. Each smiling at how Ranma was being dragged along by the high spirited young girl.<p>Turning to Cologne, Washu said, "Oh, I almost forgot. Earlier when you were in the tube, I got a message that you have a visitor."<p>Curious, Cologne asked, "Do you know who it is?"<p>Shaking her head, Washu said, "No I don't. However we'll find out in a minute."<p>Nodding, Cologne said, "Alright, but there is something I have to give Happi first. Something that's been waiting three hundred years. And no, I won't tell you just yet. You'll have to wait like everyone else."<p>Nodding, Washu followed Ranma and Sasami out of her lab. Behind her, Cologne picked up her staff and joined the group leaving the lab.<p>On Ranma's shoulder, Ryo-Ohki simply enjoyed the ride.<p>*******************<p>Back in the Masaki household...<p>Katsuhito was curious about Mousse's martial arts style. He'd learnt about it when he visited the amazon village but from his knowledge, it was only used to hold small items.<p>"Mousse?" said Katsuhito.<p>"Yeah?" replied Mousse.<p>"I was curious as to your martial arts style. I've visited the amazon village in my travels and from what I know, the hidden weapons style was only used to hold small items. Yet Azaka and Kamidake said you had large amounts of weaponry and such on you." said Katsuhito.<p>"Well, that is true. The majority of the warriors that learn it use it to hold small items and weapons. However I am a master of it and can use it to carry large amounts of weapons on my body with relative ease." replied Mousse.<p>"How are you able to displace the weight? I've learned enough of it to be able to carry a bokken or sword but not much more." said Katsuhito.<p>"That's an amazon secret. Speaking of secrets, how do you know it?" said Mousse.<p>Chuckling, Katsuhito said, "Cologne taught me a long time ago."<p>"Oh, I suppose it's okay then. She is the Matriarch afterall. So how much longer do we have to wait?" said Mousse.<p>Before Katsuhito could speak, the door to Washu's lab opened. The three men sitting at the table turned toward the sound and watched as four people emerged.<p>Sasami appeared first, pulling a male Ranma toward the kitchen. Neither noticed the three men sitting at the table.<p>At the table, a chuckling Happosai said, "Only Ranma could get dragged around by a little girl."<p>As Sasami and Ranma quickly disappeared into the kitchen, Washu stepped out of the doorway next. Glancing around, she saw the three males sitting at the table watching her. Smiling, she turned back to the doorway and spoke to someone that none of the men could see.<p>"I wonder who she's talking to." said Happosai.<p>"I don't know. I don't remember seeing anyone other than Ranma and Sasami enter Washu's lab today." replied Katsuhito.<p>"I guess we'll find out in a moment then." said Happosai.<p>Mousse simply watched events unfold. He was curious who the girl that was dragging Ranma around. She appeared too young for him to be interested in. Then there was that red headed girl near the door that they had come out from. She was young but there was something about her that bothered him. Shrugging it off for the time being, he watched as the red head talked with someone that none of them could see yet.<p>Over at the door to Washu's lab, Washu whispered to Cologne, "Come on, it's time to make your grand debut."<p>Whispering back, Cologne said, "I can't believe I'm getting scared by something so simple. I mean what if he runs away from me. What if he treats me like Ranma treated my great granddaughter. What then?"<p>Sighing, Washu said quietly, "You've waited a long time for this. If you don't do it then you'll regret it. Maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life. So get on out there and claim your man."<p>Cologne smiled as the young scientist used a quote from that old movie she'd seen back when movies were young. Who thought that those explorers would have something like that with them on an expedition.<p>Nodding slowly, Cologne began to step out into the view of the three men. Each reacted differently to the sight of her.<p>Katsuhito watched as a young woman came into view. He was curious as to who she was at first until he finally realized it was Cologne. Smiling, he wondered if her return to youth was because of Happosai's recent rejuvenation.<p>Mousse wondered why Shampoo was there. However before he spoke up, he took another look. No, it wasn't Shampoo but someone that looked very much like her. However there were several noticeable differences. Mainly the fact that the woman was at least twice Shampoo's age if not more. Mousse settled back down to watch and see what happened next.<p>Happosai however recognized her immediately. He'd never forget that vision of loveliness as long as he lived. She was the first woman he fell in love with on earth. The woman that gave him a chance only to have him ruin any hope for happiness because of his petty reasons. Well, no more would he be like he was in the past. He swore that he'd never do any of that again and he'd abide by that oath. Somehow Cologne had regained her youth and he was going to make it up to her for what he put her though all those years ago.<p>Over by the door to Washu's lab, Cologne watched as each male reacted to her emergence. She could see curiosity in Katsuhito, probably wondering who she was before a look of recognition flashed in his eyes. That irritated her a little but she'd let it slide for now since he seemed to finally remember. The next was Mousse. Wondering why he was here, she watched as he seemed to recognize her only to settle back down as if realizing she wasn't someone else. *Probably thought I was Xian Pu. I'll find out what he's doing here after I finish my business with Happi.* she thought.<p>Finally she looked at Happosai and smiled as she saw the look of recognition in his eyes. When he smiled back, her heart soared. He remembered her! She watched as several emotions played across his face. Love, sadness, shame, resolve, and finally settling on love again. He still loved her, after all these years. Her worries forgotten, she began her short journey toward Happosai.<p>As Cologne moved toward the dining table, Happosai stood and began moving toward Cologne. Soon they stood only a couple feet apart. Each gazed into the other's eyes for a moment that seemed to stretch on into infinity while the outside world faded. Finally, one of them spoke.<p>"Is that really you Kho-chan?" asked Happosai.<p>Smiling, Cologne nodded, "Yes it's me Happi."<p>"How?" asked Happi.<p>"Washu was kind enough to give me my youth back." replied Cologne.<p>"What made you do this?" asked Happi.<p>Smirking, Cologne stepped closer to Happosai and replied, "Do you really want to know?"<p>"Yes I do." replied Happosai, his voice slightly softer.<p>"Do you remember what happened between you and I in my village three hundred years ago?" asked Cologne with a predatory smirk.<p>"Um... a little bit." replied Happosai.<p>Moving closer, Cologne wrapped her arms around his neck. She could hear his heartbeat speeding up and his nervousness increase. Smiling to herself, she decided to proceed with her plans.<p>"Let me refresh your memory." she said before pulling him into a passionate kiss.<p>Happosai's arms flailed about a minute in the suddenness of the kiss he was receiving. However soon he calmed down and wrapped his arms around Cologne's youthened body.<p>Cologne smiled internally. Everything was right with her world.<p>Over by the lab door, Washu smiled at the touching scene. It filled her heart with happiness to have helped two people come together. Later she'd see about getting Happosai in for some tests. She was still a bit curious as to how a Juraian could survive off human life energy.<p>At the table, Katsuhito smiled as well. He was happy for Cologne. He remembered back when he first met Cologne. At the time she was sad because her heart had been broken. He tried to help her as best he could over the years but her heart never got over Happosai. Sure she eventually married another, but a part of her heart always belonged to Happosai.<p>With a sigh, Mousse simply watched the scene as it played out. He had a good guess as to who the woman was now. He'd heard Happosai call her Kho-chan. His shock soon turned to curiosity as to how someone could go from looking like a dried up mummy to looking like a young woman. He'd make sure to ask about it later once Cologne and Happosai parted. He smiled as he watched the two. Briefly he wondered when and if he'd ever find someone.<p>*******************<p>Nearby, a young woman sneezed...<p>*******************<p>Back in the living room...<p>Cologne and Happosai finally parted lips and came up for air. Happosai had a slightly dazed look upon his face. To all appearances, it looked like he enjoyed that kiss.<p>Cologne smiled as she gazed at Happosai. Softly she said, "Wo Ai Ni, Airen."<p>As soon as Cologne's words registered with his brain, he quickly turned toward her and said, "What?"<p>"I said, Wo Ai Ni, Airen." repeated Cologne.<p>His eyes wide, Happosai said, "Wait a minute. I've never defeated you in combat."<p>Smirking, Cologne replied, "Oh, but you have Happi. The day I used the Hiryu Shoten Ha on you. One of your little bombs flew out of the tornado and blew up right next to me. It knocked me out for an hour."<p>"B...b...b...but..." stuttered Happosai.<p>Pouting, Cologne sniffled. "You don't want to be married to me? I thought you loved me." she said while tears began to run down her face.<p>Happosai, like Ranma, could not stand to see a woman cry. Gently he embraced her and said, "Please, don't cry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I do love you. I've loved you for three hundred years."<p>Smiling inwardly, she thought, *He's so easy to manipulate. Xian Pu was never able to learn how to do this. She was too head strong. He's almost there. Now for the final move*<p>Looking up at Happosai, Cologne said, "Happi, could you at least give it a chance?"<p>Gazing into her eyes, Happosai replied, "I'd be willing to, but it wouldn't work out. I don't want to be treated as a second class citizen. Plus I'll easily outlive you. I don't want to watch as you grow old and die while I remain young looking."<p>Smiling, Cologne replied, "Don't worry about that. I'm not like those old biddies back in the village. I treat men equally. But only if they have earned it. And you Happi are definitely my equal. As for the aging problem, well Washu-chan has fixed that. I will age at the same rate you do."<p>Digesting the words she has spoken for a moment, Happosai smiled gently at her and replied, "If that is the case, then yes. I will give us a chance."<p>Wrapping her arms around Happosai, Cologne pulled him in for another kiss. She was elated when he returned the kiss without as much hesitation as before. Finally, after three hundred years, Cologne had claimed her airen.<p>The others around them simply watched and smiled. Even Mousse as he could clearly see how much they care for one another. To him, Cologne might have been a hard person to work for, as well as live with, but she was human and she deserved to find some personal happiness. However the comment about aging was nagging him. He added that to his list of things to ask about later.<p>*******************<p>In the kitchen, Ranma and Sasami peeked out as the drama unfolded in the living room. At first, Ranma was surprised to see Mousse there but shrugged it off for the time being. He'd find out later.<p>Wiping a tear from her eye, Sasami said, "That's so sweet. After all this time they finally have come together. It's so romantic."<p>Smiling down at her, Ranma replied, "Yeah. Those two definitely deserve each other. Anyways, come on, we got lunch to make and I want to show you a neat trick."<p>Glancing up at Ranma, Sasami nodded. Moving back into the kitchen, she pulled out an apron with a large carrot on it. Putting it on, she turned to see Ranma pulling several vegetables out of the fridge. Once the ingredients were gathered, he quickly went about washing them.<p>"Are you making a salad oneeniichan?" asked Sasami.<p>Smiling, Ranma nodded, "Yep. Now watch as I show you something neat."<p>Nodding back, Sasami watched as Ranma tossed the vegetables up into the air. She gasped thinking they'd be ruined. That was until Ranma leapt up into the air a short ways and began slicing and dicing them faster than she could follow. As soon as he landed, the vegetables fell out of the air and into a large salad bowl while being arranged neatly as they landed.<p>Squealing in delight, Sasami said, "That was so neat!"<p>Chuckling, Ranma replied, "I thought you'd like it. Just something I do."<p>Giggling at Ranma's cocky provado, Sasami said, "Let's get started on the rest of lunch."<p>Nodding, Ranma joined Sasami in the preparation of food.<p>*******************<p>Outside, a few minutes later...<p>Nodoka, Kasumi, and Ukyo approached the two log guardians. Each guardian scanned the three newcomers for any sign of a potential threat.<p>As they scanned the three women, both barely detected faint traces of Juraian energy coming from the sword the oldest one was carrying. Checking against current data, the two guardians were able to determine that the signature matched the one they had for Ranma.<p>The guardians allowed the three to pass safely. As soon as the three were well down the path, Azaka said, "It's a good thing Washu upgraded our sensor arrays."<p>"Yes it is. That must have been Lady Ranma's human mother." replied Kamidake.<p>"Are you sure? My scans came up inconclusive when I scanned her." said Azaka.<p>"Mine as well. I wonder what could mean?" replied Kamidake.<p>"I do not know. Perhaps in time we will find out." said Azaka.<p>"Indeed." replied Kamidake.<p>*******************<p>Several minutes later, back at the house...<p>Cologne and Happosai had finally stopped kissing and joined Katsuhito and Mousse at the table. Washu sat down as well in preparation for lunch.<p>While leaning against Happosai, Cologne glanced over at Mousse and asked, "So Mousse, why are you here? I thought I told you to keep an eye on my great granddaughter."<p>Sighing, Mousse replied, "I'm sorry elder. She refused to help run the restaurant. She didn't care if you told us to run it. When I attempted to follow her, she had disappeared. Since I was unable to run the restaurant by myself nor keep track of her, I decided to come here. I also want to apologize to Ranma and see if he will allow me his friendship."<p>Smiling, Cologne said, "It's alright. Shampoo will have to learn the realities of life on her own. Right now I am not very pleased with the way she has been acting. Perhaps she will give up on finding Ranma, but until then she will have to realize that she cannot get everything she wants. For now, I am happy to see you."<p>Nodding, Mousse said, "Thank You elder. I've decided to follow your advice. I've come to realize that I would not be happy with Shampoo as she is currently."<p>"I'm glad you've finally decided to listen to me. I hope you will find someone that will return your affections." said Cologne.<p>"Me too." replied Mousse.<p>About that time, a knock was heard from the front door. Glancing over at the door, Katsuhito wondered who it could be. The rest of the table's occupants were wondering the same thing as well.<p>Stepping out of the kitchen, Sasami said, "I'll get it."<p>Wiping her hands off on her apron, Sasami opened the door to be greeted by three women. One older than the other two.<p>Smiling, Sasami said, "Yes? May I help you?"<p>Returning the smile, Nodoka said, "I hope so. I was wondering if this was the Masaki shrine?"<p>Shaking her head, Sasami replied, "No, this is the Masaki household. The shrine is up the stairs over by the sacred tree."<p>Sighing, Nodoka said, "Oh good, we're in the right place then."<p>Before Sasami could respond, a voice from inside called out, "Hey Sasami, who's at the door?"<p>Hearing the voice, Nodoka thought it sounded familiar. So did Kasumi and Ukyo.<p>Curious, Nodoka asked, "Um, if you don't mind, could you tell me who that was?"<p>Nodding, Sasami replied, "That was my oneeniichan."<p>Blinking a moment, all three women mouthed, "o...nee...nii...chan?"<p>"Hey Sasami, lunch is almost ready." said Ranma has he stepped up behind her.<p>"Ranma?" asked Nodoka.<p>Glancing up to see who said his name, a happy yet relieved Ranma yelled, "Mom!"<p>Sliding past Sasami, Ranma grabbed his mother in a fierce hug. A few tears falling down his face. Nodoka returned the hug with an equal fierceness.<p>"I'm so glad your alright. I was afraid I might lose you." said Ranma into his mother's kimono.<p>"I'm ok. I have you to thank. If it were not for the sword you made, I would not be here now." replied Nodoka.<p>Kasumi and Ukyo simply hung back as mother and son embraced one another. Sasami was curious as to what they were talking about before she remembered what happened the previous night before she fell asleep.<p>"Come on Mom. Let's go inside. It's lunch time and I want to introduce you to everybody." said Ranma.<p>Nodding, Nodoka followed Ranma into the house. Kasumi, Ukyo, and Sasami close behind.<p>*******************<p>In the living room...<p>A few more of the occupants of the house had arrived for lunch. Each sat around the table while making small talk with one another. Currently, the only ones missing were Kiyone and Mihoshi. However they were most likely somewhere in space so nobody minded much.<p>Standing up, Katsuhito was just about to see what was keeping Ranma and Sasami before Ranma appeared in the entranceway followed closely by Sasami and three other women. He waited until they all had entered fully before speaking up.<p>"Whom do we have here?" he asked.<p>Smiling, Ranma said, "This is my mom. And the two others with her are Ukyo and Kasumi."<p>"I am honored to be here." said Nodoka.<p>"Hello." said Kasumi.<p>"Hi." said Ukyo<p>"Ah yes. I remember you mentioning them coming. Please, come in and join us for lunch. I'm sure Ranma and Sasami have prepared something very nice. Afterwards we can see about fixing up some rooms for you to stay in." said Katsuhito.<p>"I almost forgot about lunch!" cried Sasami as she hurried into the kitchen. Ranma following close behind while smiling.<p>"But Grandpa, we don't have any more room." said Tenchi.<p>Looking over at Tenchi, Katsuhito said, "Don't worry about it Tenchi. I'm sure Washu can take care of everything."<p>Nodding, Washu said, "Of course."<p>As Kasumi and Ukyo sat down at the table, Nodoka approached Katsuhito with a raised eyebrow. "Excuse me." she said.<p>Turning back to Ranma's mother, Katsuhito replied, "Yes?"<p>"I couldn't help hearing that young man call you Grandpa." said Nodoka.<p>"Yes, Tenchi is my grandson. Why do you ask?" said Katsuhito.<p>"I couldn't help but wonder how a man that appears to be no older than I am could have a grandchild as old as he is." said Nodoka.<p>At this time all eyes turned to Katsuhito with curiosity. All they saw was an old man that ran the shrine. Each wondered what Ranma's mother was talking about.<p>"Um... What do you mean?" said Katsuhito while internally he kept hoping that Ranma's mother couldn't see through his disguise field.<p>"I mean that you appear to be around my age with long black hair, eye glasses, and wearing shrine robes. I was just curious as to how that young man over at the table could be your grandson." replied Nodoka.<p>"What is she talking about brother dear?" interjected Ayeka.<p>Caught between a rock and a hard place, Katsuhito's hoping seemed to be dashed.<p>Turning toward Ayeka, he said, "Well you see..."<p>*******************<p>To be continued...<p>*******************<p>Authors Notes:<p>Uh oh, Katsuhito's big secret has been revealed. How will the others react to the truth? What will Tenchi think of having a Grandfather that looks as old as his own father? When will Azusa and his wives make their appearance. Will Happosai eventually remember the wedding night comes after the wedding? What secrets with Washu's scans of Ranma reveal? All this and more in the next chapter of: Child of the Goddess!<p></p>
