</div><p>***Previously...***<p>As Kasumi and Ukyo sat down at the table, Nodoka approached Katsuhito with a raised eyebrow. "Excuse me." she said.<p>Turning back to Ranma's mother, Katsuhito replied, "Yes?"<p>"I couldn't help hearing that young man call you Grandpa." said Nodoka.<p>"Yes, Tenchi is my grandson. Why do you ask?" said Katsuhito.<p>"I couldn't help but wonder how a man that appears to be no older than I am could have a grandchild as old as he is." said Nodoka.<p>At this time all eyes turned to Katsuhito with curiosity. All they saw was an old man that ran the shrine. Each wondered what Ranma's mother was talking about.<p>"Um... What do you mean?" said Katsuhito while internally he kept hoping that Ranma's mother couldn't see through his disguise field.<p>"I mean that you appear to be around my age with long black hair, eye glasses, and wearing shrine robes. I was just curious as to how that young man over at the table could be your grandson." replied Nodoka.<p>"What is she talking about brother dear?" interjected Ayeka.<p>Caught between a rock and a hard place, Katsuhito's hoping seemed to be dashed.<p>Turning toward Ayeka, he said, "Well you see..."<p>*******************<p>And now, the conclusion...<p>Child of the Goddess<p>Chapter 8<p>By: Gekigengar3<p>Disclaimer: All characters, and such are the copyrights and property of their respective owners. I claim no ownership of any character and such in any way.<p>***Warning***<p>This chapter has limish content toward the end. You have been warned.<p>***End Warning***<p>"" = Spoken words<br/>** = Thoughts<br/>{} = Cabbit<br/>[] = Mental Communication<p>A simple statement. That was all it took for Katsuhito's secret to be revealed. He could not fault Ranma's mother for it. No, even though she could somehow see through his disguise field, she was still unaware of his reasons behind keeping his true appearance hidden. The reasons he left Jurai in the first place. The reason he did not marry Ayeka, his half sister. And so, with the quiet sigh of a man who knew he was doomed, he turned to Ayeka and began to finally tell her the truth.<p>"Ayeka, I'm afraid I haven't been totally honest with you. You see, I'm not as old as you perceive me to be." said Katsuhito<p>Smirking, Washu began planning to get Ranma's mother into her lab sometime soon. She knew about Katsuhito's disguise field but had decided not to mention it earlier. For some reason Ranma's mother could see through a Juraian disguise field, something even she couldn't do with all her high tech toys. All she was able to accomplish was the detection of one in operation. Oh yes, she would be studying Ranma's mother in great detail sometime in the near future.<p>Frowning, Ayeka replied, "Oh? What do you mean?"<p>Sighing, Katsuhito asked, "Are you familiar with a Juraian disguise field?"<p>Shaking her head, Ayeka replied, "No. I've heard of them in passing but never sought to learn more. From what I know, only covert agents of the empire use them. Why do you ask?"<p>Closing his eyes, Katsuhito deactivated his disguise field. Several gasps came from the spectators around the table. Most likely from the newer arrivals he thought. He knew that he'd get those kind of reactions. What else would one do if they saw an old man suddenly become young. Finally, ready to face the music, he opened his eyes to see the facial reactions of those watching.<p>To his surprise, the newer arrivals barely blinked an eye. He was a bit curious as to how they could accept something so easily. Then again from what he'd heard of Ranma's life, they probably had to learn to adapt to the unusual very quickly.<p>"Grandpa?" asked Tenchi, obviously confused.<p>"Yes it is me." said Katsuhito.<p>"But how?" asked Tenchi.<p>"Yes brother. Please tell us why you lied about your true appearance and not returning to Jurai." said Ayeka, her voice as cold as a frigidaire.<p>Gulping at the glare his own sister was focusing at him, Katsuhito sat down and said, "I did not lie about everything. My ship was destroyed when I was battling Ryoko. I had no way to return to Jurai nor any way to communicate either. For all intents and purposes, I was marooned here."<p>"Grandpa." said Tenchi, indicating the new arrivals.<p>Seeing Tenchi's concern, Katsuhito said, "Do not worry about it Tenchi. They will be here for a while and will learn of this eventually if they do not know about it already."<p>"Yeah, don't worry about us sugar. This is nothing compared to some of the stuff we've seen. Right Kasumi?" said Ukyo.<p>"Oh my, yes. Ranma has so many interesting friends that come and visit." replied Kasumi.<p>"Err, right." said Ukyo while Ryoko just looked at Kasumi strangely.<p>"Now girls, let them continue. This seems to be very important." said Nodoka.<p>"Yes Auntie." they replied in tandem.<p>While Nodoka took a seat next to Katsuhito, Ayeka asked, "Why didn't you use your tree to call for help?"<p>"My tree was weak from the battle. She barely had enough strength to survive let alone provide me with energy. So in order to save her, I did the only thing I could do. I planted her into the soil so she could take root and survive." replied Katsuhito.<p>Her anger easing slightly, Ayeka asked, "If that is the case, then how can you still be this young?"<p>"Something unexpected happened. I only found out about it some ten years after I had built the shrine so that I could keep an eye on Ryoko's tomb. I noticed that my aging was still as slow as ever. And it was slowing with each passing year. With my tree having taken root, I should have started aging more rapidly. Similar to how the people of earth age. When I looked into it, I found that somehow, Ryoko's gems were supplying my tree with power. In turn, this was keeping me from aging as fast as I should have been." replied Katsuhito.<p>Confused, Ayeka asked, "But how is that possible? Only the water of life and the Power of Jurai can keep a Juraian from aging."<p>"I'll field this one Katsuhito." piped up Washu before continuing, "You see Ayeka, for some reason, the gems that give Ryoko her power are very similar to the Power of Jurai. How do you think Ryoko was able to get through Jurai's defenses so easily?"<p>"You mean?" asked Ayeka.<p>Nodding, Washu replied, "Yes, the energy of the gems comes from a source that is similar to Tsunami. As long as there is a single gem in the hilt of the master key, Katsuhito will age very slowly. But I do not know much more than that at the moment."<p>"I didn't mean to hurt you Ayeka. But you know as well as I do that we would not have had any peace on Jurai. Back then, prejudices of other races ran deep among the houses. Father was one of the first to see beyond that narrow minded view." said Katsuhito.<p>Sighing, Ayeka said, "Why didn't you tell me earlier? When we first learned you were indeed my brother."<p>"I did not wish to hurt you. I thought it would be better if you believed that I was too old for you to pursue. Tell me, would it have made any difference if I had revealed my true age and appearance to you then? Would you have tried to pursue me?" said Katsuhito.<p>"I... I don't know. Perhaps. But I still would have wanted to know the truth and not have been lied to." replied Ayeka.<p>As Katsuhito and Ayeka had their heart to heart talk, the others around the table watched while keeping silent. To the residents of the shrine, this single conversation would dictate how these two would interact with one another from that point on. To Ukyo, Kasumi, and Nodoka, the conversation had little meaning to them. However each listened in order to learn more of this obviously alien race.<p>*Oh my, this is so sad. He left her so that they would both have peace in their lives. It sounds like it's right out of a romantic manga.* thought Kasumi.<p>*Wow, this race that Ranchan is part of sounds complex. They even allow brothers and sisters to marry.* thought Ukyo.<p>*To put the well being of his sister before himself. He's so Manly!* thought Nodoka.<p>"I'm sorry Ayeka. I should have told you right away. But at the time I thought it to be for the best." said Katsuhito.<p>"Best! How is it for the best that I don't know the truth! I would think you'd trust me more than this!" half yelled Ayeka.<p>Hanging his head, Katsuhito replied, "I'm sorry. It was wrong of me and yes, I should have trusted you enough to tell you the truth."<p>Calming down slightly, Ayeka asked, "Do mother and father know?"<p>Sighing, Katsuhito said, "Funaho knows. I don't know about Misaki. As for father, I don't know one way or the other."<p>At the mention of Misaki, Happosai stiffened momentarily. However, as soon as Cologne made her presence known again, he relaxed.<p>Gazing at Katsuhito critically for a few moments, Ayeka finally sighed and asked, "How am I supposed to trust you again? You lied to me. Your own sister."<p>"As I said before, I am sorry, and I will try and find someway to make it up to you." said Katsuhito.<p>Thinking a moment, Ayeka began to develop a devilish little smirk. "Oh brother dear?" she said.<p>Gulping at the smirk that reminded him so much of Misaki, Katsuhito said, "Yes?"<p>"I might find it in my heart to forgive you if you do just one little thing for me." said Ayeka.<p>"What would that be?" asked Katsuhito.<p>A sudden chill went down Tenchi's spine as he got a slight premonition of something big happening soon. He'd gotten that same chill the day his mother died, the day he found Ryoko, the day he fought Kagato, the day he went after Clay, and the day he met his great grandparents. Silently he prayed that he would still be alive after whatever was about to happen took place.<p>"I will forgive you and release you from our betrothal if you will give me your permission and blessings to... " said Ayeka.<p>Everyone leaned forward to hear the next words that would leave Ayeka's mouth.<p>"...wed Tenchi." said Ayeka.<p>Katsuhito waited for the inevitable explosion of Ryoko who would begin arguing with Ayeka over Tenchi. However, when none came, he cracked open an eye to see why she was oddly silent. What greeted his vision was very odd to say the least. Ryoko was sitting there, sipping tea, and smiling.<p>Washu too thought something was odd. Usually Ryoko would get very violent and attack Ayeka when something like this came up. But for some reason, Ryoko was just sitting there quietly sipping tea. Curious, Washu decided to use their link to find out what was going on.<p>[Why are you being quiet Ryoko?] asked Washu mentally.<p>A moment passed before Ryoko responded, [It's just something Ayeka said. It reminded me of something that I had mostly overlooked until now.]<p>[More like forgot.] said Washu mentally.<p>[Hey!] responded Ryoko through the link.<p>[So what was it?] asked Washu again, genuinely curious.<p>[Oh nothing much. It's just that since Tenchi is the crown prince and will become emperor one day, he will have to eventually marry. When he does, it is Juraian custom for the emperor to have at least two wives.] said Ryoko, showing an unusual amount of intelligence for once.<p>[You're acting unusually smart. How did this come about?] asked Washu.<p>[Ever since I joined with Zero, I've been doing alot of thinking about things. How I felt about things and people. I've also been studying up on Juraian law and customs.] responded Ryoko.<p>[Ah, I see now. You're not only in love with Tenchi. You're also in love with Ayeka as well.] said Washu.<p>[What! No way do I care about that old hag!] retorted Ryoko.<p>[Come now Ryoko. Who do you think you're kidding. You're in love with the both of them and you know it.] said Washu.<p>[I... I... Alright fine! I am in love with both of them! Ya happy now?] responded Ryoko.<p>[I just wanted to make sure that you acknowledged it yourself. And, that I will help you in whatever way I can. I meant what I said the other night Ryoko. You will make a wonderful mother one day. Perhaps that day won't be too far into the future.] said Washu.<p>[Um...Thank You... Mom.] replied Ryoko with real emotion behind the word mom.<p>[You're welcome dear.] responded Washu.<p>The conversation between Washu and Ryoko only took a few moments. During those moments, the others around the table were watching intently as Ryoko continued to sit in peace and not utter a single response to Ayeka's proposal.<p>Tenchi wasn't paying much attention though. He was still praying that Ayeka and Ryoko would not hurt anyone when the fighting began. He didn't want Ranma's mother and friends to be hurt by one of Ayeka and Ryoko's fights.<p>Washu tossed Katsuhito a look that told him to add a little something to Ayeka's proposal or suffer one of her many experiments.<p>Gulping at the look Washu gave him, Katsuhito thought about Ayeka's proposal for a moment. *Well, it is what I have been trying to do for some time now. And Ayeka did say she'd forgive me if I consented. But can I do that to Tenchi without his approval? Hmm... Then there's Ryoko's odd behavior. Could she have finally figured out that Tenchi is supposed to have two wives by Jurian custom? It is possible. Perhaps if I... Yes, that might just work.* thought Katsuhito.<p>While Katsuhito thought, Cologne mearly smiled. *This Ayeka may not be a fighter, but she does have considerable power if what I saw last night was any indication. Then again it didn't affect Ranma very much. Perhaps due to the boy's origins. But this Ayeka does have a keen mind as well. I wonder if I should try and start another Amazon society here in Japan. There certainly isn't any shortage of strong blood. Hmm... I will have to give this more thought later. For now, I need to plan for tonight. You're in for quite a surprise tonight Happi. I mean to make up for those three hundred years we were apart. With interest.* thought Cologne.<p>Happosai shivered as though someone walked over his grave.<p>Clearing his throat to get everyone's attention, Katsuhito turned to Ayeka. "Ayeka, I shall give you my permission and blessings to wed Tenchi." he said.<p>Smiling, Ayeka replied, "Thank you very much brother. I forgive you and release you from our betrothal. I know that Tenchi and I shall be very happy together."<p>Before Ayeka could say more, Katsuhito interrupted her, "However..." he said.<p>"However?" asked Ayeka, her glare of doom beginning to form.<p>Trying to ignore Ayeka's forming glare, Katsuhito continued, "However, the final decision is Tenchi's. You may wed him, if that is what he desires."<p>"Very well. I shall adhere to Lord Tenchi's decision." said Ayeka, confident that Tenchi would indeed choose to marry her.<p>"Huh?" said Tenchi.<p>Smiling, Katsuhito said, "The decision is yours Tenchi. However, do not decide right away. I wish to talk to you in private before your decision is made about your first wife."<p>"Um... Ok... I think..." replied Tenchi, obviously confused about what was happening. From what he could figure, Ayeka had finally cornered him on making a decision. Ryoko had yet to make a violent retort. He couldn't figure out what his grandfather meant with that remark about his first wife. And Ranma's mother was giving him a very odd look.<p>*******************<p>Peaking out from the kitchen, Ranma surveyed the room. From his perspective, everything was peaceful. Ayeka was smiling. Ryoko was smiling. Tenchi was sweating buckets. Cologne was snuggled up with Happosai. Mousse looked as confused as ever. Kasumi was sniffling while wiping her eyes with a handkerchief. Ukyo was shaking her head slowly. Katsuhito seemed to have gotten younger. How that happened, he didn't know. All he could tell was it was the old man from his energy signature. And his mother was giving Tenchi a look that just screamed that Tenchi was very manly. He sweatdropped at that.<p>Returning to the kitchen, Ranma helped Sasami get everything ready to be served.<p>"Is everyone ok oneeniichan?" asked Sasami.<p>Scratching his head, Ranma replied, "I think so. Ayeka and Ryoko are smiling and Tenchi's nervous for some reason. I think something happened but I can't figure out what. My mom... well the less said about the look she's giving him, the better."<p>"That's unusual for Ayeka and Ryoko to be smiling for no reason. Tenchi-nichan is always nervous when Ayeka and Ryoko get along. I wonder what happened." said Sasami.<p>"I don't know. But whatever it was, it's made my mom thing that he's very manly." replied Ranma.<p>"What?" asked Sasami.<p>Sighing, Ranma said, "My mom's got some weird ideas about being a man. I'm not even sure I know all of them. All I know, is that somehow, she greatly approves of Tenchi for some reason."<p>"Um... What about you?" said Sasami.<p>Chuckling, Ranma said, "I'm not too sure. I know she thinks I'm manly and all that. But I also know she cares about me and that there are other parts to me than just being a man. Heh, I probably wouldn't put it past her to think I'm being manly even when I'm a girl. Which would be true in some sense since I only like girls even when I am one."<p>"She sounds weird. But my own mom has her quirks too." said Sasami.<p>"Oh? What kind?" asked Ranma.<p>Thinking a moment, Sasami replied, "Well she loves chocolate. She can't get enough of it. The same goes for anything sweet. Also, if she ever gets mad at you, call her a pretty young lady. She'll usually forgive you almost instantly."<p>"Yer right. She does have some quirks." said Ranma.<p>"True, but she's my mommy and I love her."<p>"Yeah, I love my mom as well." replied Ranma.<p>"And I love you too dear." said a woman's voice from right behind Ranma.<p>"Ack!" said a startled Ranma. Quickly turning around, he was met with the sight of his mother chuckling softly.<p>Still slightly chuckling, Nodoka said, "I'm sorry about that dear. I didn't mean to startle you."<p>Scratching the back of his head, Ranma replied, "Um... It's ok mom. Better you than someone else. So what brings you here?"<p>"I just thought you two might like some help with lunch." said Nodoka.<p>"That's alright mom. We were just finishing up actually." replied Ranma.<p>"Oh where are my manners. I haven't been properly introduced to this little one. Hello dear, my name is Nodoka. I'm Ranma's mother." said Nodoka to Sasami.<p>Smiling, Sasami replied, "A pleasure to meet you. I'm Sasami. I'm Ranma's little sister."<p>"Such a proper young lady. But how are you his little sister?" said Nodoka.<p>"That's kind of a long story mom. The short version is that Sasami hurt herself very badly when she was younger. My other mother, Tsunami, appeared and merged with Sasami to save her life. When Sasami gets older, she and Tsunami will merge into one being. Until then, Sasami is going to be my little sister." said Ranma.<p>Blinking a moment at the new information, Nodoka replied, "I see. Well I must say that she is very beautiful and sweet. But where are her parents?"<p>"They're on Jurai. I'm staying here with my sister and everyone else." said Sasami while blushing a little from the praise her oneeniichan's mother gave her.<p>Smiling, Nodoka said, "Well in that case, since Ranma's adopted you as his little sister, how would you like it if I adopted you as my daughter while your parents are away?"<p>Excited that she could have a mother while her real parents were away, Sasami said "Really?"<p>Nodding, Nodoka smiled and said, "Yes, really."<p>Crying out in delight, Sasami rushed forward and gave Nodoka a big hug. Ranma mearly hung back and smiled at the scene. He knew his mom always wanted a daughter. Well, now she had a son, as well as two daughters.<p>"Congratulations mom. It's a girl." said a chuckling Ranma.<p>Smiling, Nodoka said, "Why you, get over here and give your mother and sister a hug."<p>Spreading his arms, Ranma joined the group hug. It only lasted a few moments, but the love was very palatable. Once it was complete, the three separated.<p>"Well, now that we have that out of the way, is there anything a mother can do to help her two children." said a smiling Nodoka.<p>Smiling, Ranma said, "Well, we could use some help to take everything out to the table."<p>"All right dear." Nodoka said.<p>*******************<p>While lunch was about to be served at the Masaki household, two people on the other side of the universe finished their own lunch.<p>In the quarters of Ramsus, Tokimi's first chosen warrior, two people sat and enjoyed the nutrition that was required to sustain their bodies. Of course they could have gone without eating anything due to Tokimi's power. However it was something that both enjoyed doing.<p>"How was your meal?" asked Ramsus.<p>Thinking about it a moment, Nabiki replied, "It wasn't bad. Although I'm not really certain of what I just ate."<p>Chuckling a little, Ramsus said, "It's a dish that originated in a remote corner of the galaxy. I picked up the recipe while traveling through the area. Some of the ingredients are hard to come by."<p>"Oh? When was this?" asked Nabiki.<p>"It was before I came into the service of Lady Tokimi. At the time, I was just wandering the universe battling those I came across and trying to learn more about life." replied Ramsus.<p>Curious, Nabiki asked, "How did you end up here?"<p>Thinking back on it for a minute or two, Ramsus said, "Well I suppose it all started about a year ago. I was traveling through a section of the galaxy that was mostly unexplored. I was curious about what might be in that region. There, I met up with someone in the service of Lady Tokimi. For the life of me, I cannot remember their name. My memories of that time are scattered. All I can remember is an intense battle unlike any I've been in before. After that, my memory is a blank until I woke up here. Lady Tokimi saved my life and in turn, I swore to serve her."<p>Contemplating his story for a moment, Nabiki couldn't help but feel that it paralleled a certain pigtailed youth and some of his life. Looking up, she studied the man before her and compared him to the object of her revenge. Both were similar in that they loved to battle. However the man before her was more mature by light years. Not only in his personality and demeanor, but in appearance as well. Where Ranma was still a boy, the man before her was just that. A man. She didn't know how she felt about him and their new partnership, but for one of the first times in her life, she felt safe with someone. She didn't know why or whether it was some side effect of Lady Tokimi's power that coursed through them. All she knew is that for now, she had found an ally that might be able to help her finish what she started back on earth.<p>"How about you? What brought you here?" asked Ramsus, breaking Nabiki out of her contemplation.<p>Sadly, Nabiki said, "My younger sister was killed recently. Her fiancee had returned and told us how she died. But there were holes in his story. The biggest being that he killed a phoenix god."<p>Sucking in a breath, Ramsus said, "A phoenix? Are you sure?"<p>Looking at him a moment, Nabiki said, "What? You know something about it?"<p>Thinking a moment, Ramsus replied, "A phoenix is a very rare and powerful creature. Most races talk about them only in legends. However if one were on the planet you came from, then others would have noticed it. Their power is great enough that it is easily sensed. If nobody sensed it, then the phoenix god you were talking about was most likely either a being that had some phoenix ancestry or an avatar of a phoenix. But even then, a being like that would not be beaten by a mortal very easily."<p>"Interesting. You are probably right that it wasn't a true phoenix then. Anyways, as I was saying, my late sister's fiancee told us the story of what happened to her. While he told the story, I couldn't help but feel that there was something that wasn't right. I mean, how could a martial artist, no matter how good, kill a being that powerful?" said Nabiki.<p>"They couldn't. The only way would be to have more power." replied Ramsus.<p>"Exactly. I figured that he had enough power to defeat that thing all along. I only recently learned that one of his mothers is Tsunami, Lady Tokimi's sister. So instead of saving my sister, he was being his usual cocky self and holding back. Playing with that thing until my little sister was dead. Then he went and killed it. He let her die." said Nabiki.<p>"Very interesting, but that still does not answer my question." said Ramsus.<p>"I'm getting to that. You see, the next day he left for somewhere. I don't know where but that night I went to kill his mother. I was determined to make him pay for letting my sister die. However he stopped me just as I was swinging her sword toward her neck." said Nabiki.<p>"How did he stop you? If he was gone, he should not have been able to." said Ramsus.<p>"I don't know. All I know is that one moment I'm swinging her sword and the next, it's glowing and stuck in mid air. Then his voice comes from nowhere and wakes her up. She unmasked me and I ran from my house. After that, I was brought here. I agreed to serve Lady Tokimi so that I would have the power to kill him." said Nabiki.<p>"Hmm... That is an odd scenario. Tell me, was there anything odd about the sword?" asked Ramsus.<p>Thinking about it a moment, Nabiki nodded, "Yeah, now that you mention it, there was something odd about it. It wasn't the one she normally carried around. It was more elaborate and detailed. From what I could see in the dark, it had a relief etched into the blade and scabbard. A hawk in flight and a panther prowling."<p>His eyes widening, Ramsus said, "I think I may know how he stopped you. That sword must have been made by the Light Hawk Wings. However there is something else that worries me more. You said there was a relief of a panther on the sword and scabbard?"<p>"Yeah. What about it?" said Nabiki.<p>"Tell me, does this guy you're after know any techniques involving cats?" asked Ramsus, his voice deadly serious.<p>Gazing into his eyes, Nabiki said, "Yeah, just one I can think of. A technique his idiot father tried to teach him."<p>"What was the name of that technique?" asked Ramsus.<p>"The Neko-ken. Why? What's so important about it?" said Nabiki.<p>His gaze very serious, Ramsus replied, "Because, that technique was one developed by Lady Tokimi herself millennia ago to train cannon fodder as berserkers. It's a technique of death and destruction that allows those trained in it to tap into her power. How anyone on your planet knows of it, is a mystery. The only reason he probably didn't go permanently insane is because he is Tsunami's child. The only good thing I can think of is that he most likely doesn't have conscious control of it."<p>Wincing slightly, Nabiki said, "Actually, he does. I saw him using it the day I was going to kill his mother."<p>"We must inform Lady Tokimi of this immediately! The child of Tsunami must not be allowed to develop that power any further!" said Ramsus, his voice as hard as steel.<p>His words sinking in, Nabiki could only nod. To her, this was not good. It appeared Ranma had access to her lady's power.<p>*******************<p>Meanwhile, back at the Masaki household...<p>It had taken a while, but lunch was finally being served to the hungry residents of the Masaki household. The dishes were set out on the table and everyone had just sat down to enjoy the food that had been prepared by Sasami and Ranma. The only people missing were Mihoshi and Kiyone. Both were most likely on duty.<p>Before any bites were taken, Katsuhito cleared his throat to get everyone's attention. Once he was sure that everyone was paying attention, he began to introduce the new arrivals to the residents of the house.<p>"You've all met our visitors, so I'd like to introduce them to everyone else here. To my right is Ayeka. Next to her is Tenchi, my grandson. On the other side of him is Ryoko."<p>"Hello." said Ayeka.<p>"Um... Hi..." said Tenchi.<p>"Yo." said Ryoko.<p>Continuing on, Katsuhito said, "I believe some of you either know or have met Mousse. And next to him are Cologne and Happosai."<p>"Hi." said Mousse to those that did not know him.<p>"No way that could be them. They're way too young." said Ukyo indication the youthened Happosai and Cologne.<p>"Is that really them?" asked Kasumi.<p>Nodding, Happosai said, "I'm afraid he's right Ukyo."<p>Next to him, Cologne backed Happi up, "He's right. I am indeed Cologne, Matriarch of the Amazons."<p>Confused, Ukyo said, "But how?"<p>Chuckling, Happi said, "Well I'm Juraian. Ranma here undid something that was done to me three hundred years ago. Once that was done, I returned to a younger appearance."<p>"Yeah, me and mom figured you learned your lesson." said Ranma<p>"And Washu-chan here used her knowledge to make me younger again while extending my life so that I could live as long as Happi." said Cologne.<p>"Oh it was nothing for a genius of my caliber! It was just a simple matter of reverting the cells to a earlier state of age and fusing some Juraian DNA into the cellular structure. It was child's play." said Washu<p>Perking up at the sound of medical talk, Kasumi asked, "Oh my, are you a doctor?"<p>Looking over at Kasumi, Washu smiled as she saw a glimmer of fascination in Kasumi's eyes. Reminded of herself when she would find something new to figure out, Washu replied, "In a sense. I am... The greatest scientific genius in the universe!"<p>Everyone but Kasumi and Washu sweatdropped. Giggling happily, Kasumi said, "Oh my, how wonderful! Do you have any medical books that I could borrow? I've always dreamed of being a nurse or a doctor.<p>Thinking for a moment, Washu smiled and said, "I'll tell you what Kasumi-chan. Instead of letting you learn on your own, I'll take you under my wing and teach you all there is to know about Health and Medicine. How does that sound?"<p>Smiling happily, Kasumi nodded, "Oh my, that would be wonderful! Thank you very much sensei!"<p>A frightening scene came to Ayeka's mind at the moment.<p>***Ayeka's Mindscape***<p>Ayeka had to talk to Kasumi about something important. Stepping up to Kasumi, Ayeka said, "Miss Kasumi?"<p>Frowning, Kasumi glanced at Ayeka with a glare that said, Try again. Her finger over a holographic button labeled: 'Kappa Transformation'.<p>Gulping, Ayeka tried again. Only this time with a little modification.<p>"Little Kasumi?" Ayeka said.<p>Smiling while removing her finger from over the button, Kasumi said, "Yes? What is it?"<p>***Exit Ayeka's Mindscape***<p>Shivering slightly at the thoughts going through her head, Ayeka put on her best face and said, "That's wonderful news."<p>"Indeed it is. For now though, let us finish the introductions and eat lunch before it gets too cold." said Katsuhito.<p>As everyone nodded, Katsuhito continued, "Now that Washu has been introduced, that only leaves Sasami. There are two others that stay here but they are currently working. "<p>"Hello." said Sasami.<p>"And finally myself. I am Katsuhito Masaki. I am the keeper of the shrine located nearby. And I'm sure everyone here knows Ranma." said Katsuhito.<p>"Hey guys." said Ranma, smiling and waving before turning toward Katsuhito. "I don't mean to pry, but I was wondering how you got so young." he asked.<p>"I had a disguise field around me that hid my true appearance from everyone. Partially for my own reasons but also so that the nearby people didn't get suspicious about my not aging like they do." replied Katsuhito.<p>Before anyone else could speak, a happy little Cabbit hopped into the dining area. Seeing all the new visitors, she hopped into Ranma's lap to get a better view. Looking up at her new best friend, she Miyahh'd.<p>{"Who are all the new people?"} she asked.<p>Seeing the cat like creature jump into his lap, Ukyo said, "Oh no!"<p>"Oh my!" said Kasumi.<p>Smiling at the two, Ranma pet Ryo-Ohki in that oh so special spot that melted her faster than a Washu brand snow cone on the sun.<p>Confused, Ukyo said, "What the? I though you were afraid of cats Ranchan."<p>"Not anymore. I finally mastered the fear. Now I ain't afraid of cats anymore. I can even talk to em." said Ranma happily.<p>Curious, Ayeka said, "Why were you afraid of cats Lord Ranma?"<p>Nervous, Ranma said, "Oh... um... it's nothing you need to worry about Ayeka. It's not something I like talking about."<p>Not really convinced, Ayeka decided to let the matter drop for now. She'd look into it later.<p>Looking down at Ryo-Ohki, Ranma said while indicating who he was talking about, "That's my mom. And that's my best friend Ukyo. And that over there is Kasumi."<p>Hopping over to Nodoka's shoulder, Ryo-Ohki nuzzled up against her face.<p>Chuckling, Ranma said, "It looks like she likes you."<p>Smiling, Nodoka pet Ryo-Ohki in the same spot that Ranma had pet her.<p>"She sure is cute." said Nodoka.<p>*Oh wow! Ranma-sama's mother knows that spot as well!* Ryo-Ohki thought.<p>"Well let's eat. We can't let all this food me and Sasami cooked go to waste, can we?" said Ranma.<p>Everyone ate while making various small chat. Kasumi was looking forward to learning from Washu. Ayeka and Ryoko managed to act civil to one another. Tenchi was nervous for many reasons. Mainly because Ryoko and Ayeka were getting along as well as Kasumi would be learning from Washu. He could just picture Kasumi using him in some weird medical experiment.<p>As lunch was finished, Nodoka and Kasumi helped Sasami clean up the dishes. Washu went to begin work on some more rooms for the new guests. Ryoko decided to go and take a nap. Ayeka went to watch some television programs. Ukyo decided to tag along with Ayeka since there wasn't anything better to do at the moment. Tenchi followed his Grandpa outside and toward the shrine.<p>"Hey Ranma. I need to talk to you for a moment." said Mousse.<p>Nodding, Ranma stepped outside with Mousse while Cologne and Happosai followed, giving the two some distance to talk about things.<p>"So whatdya wanna talk about?" asked Ranma, genuinely curious since Mousse hadn't tried to blame him for stealing Shampoo.<p>Sighing, Mousse said, "I wanted to apologize for everything I've done to you. For all the threats, all the fights, all the times I blamed you for my problems."<p>Confused, Ranma asked, "What brought this on?"<p>Chuckling, Mousse said, "Before Cologne left, she talked with me about some things. She helped me to see how much I've been acting like Kuno. She helped open my eyes and when she did, I realized that I was wrong in fighting you like I did."<p>"Whoa. Must've been some talk." said Ranma.<p>Nodding, Mousse said, "Yeah. I've also decided to give up on pursuing Shampoo."<p>"Really?" asked Ranma.<p>"Yeah, Cologne explained to me how much Shampoo was stubborn and immature. Blinded to the world worse than I was. Cologne was able to make me see the truth of the matter. I wouldn't have been happy with Shampoo. Not as she currently is." said Mousse.<p>"Whatya gonna do now?" asked Ranma.<p>Thinking a moment, Mousse replied, "Well I was hoping to stay here for now. I have to talk with Cologne first. I was supposed to keep an eye on Shampoo, but I wasn't able to."<p>Before Ranma could reply, Cologne interrupted, "I figured something like this might happen. That was why I gave you that address Mousse."<p>Turning, Mousse replied, "You did? But why have me stay there even though you knew she'd be able to elude me?"<p>Smiling, Cologne stood only a few feet from Mousse, Happosai by her side. She replied, "I did it so that you could make your own decisions and do what you truly wanted to do. Not what I or anyone else wanted you to do. It had to be your own decision to break free from your pursuit of my great grand daughter."<p>Nodding, Mousse said, "I understand now. And, I thank you."<p>"Now that we have that settled, I believe there is one further thing you'd like to say to Ranma, isn't there?" said Happosai.<p>With a nod, Mousse turned back to Ranma. Taking a breath, Mousse extended his hand. "Ranma, would you like to be friends?" he asked.<p>Seeing the gesture, and hearing the words, Ranma's heart panged with ache for a moment as he was reminded of Akane. Soon it ebbed away. Smiling, he nodded while shaking Mousse's hand.<p>Smiling in return, Mousse said, "Thank You."<p>"It's no problem. I'm sure you'll like it around here. It's pretty peaceful for the most part." said Ranma.<p>Nodding, Mousse replied, "It does seem that way."<p>Patting Mousse on the back, Ranma said, "And don't worry about Shampoo. I'm sure we can help find you somebody else. Right guys?"<p>"Right!" corused a smiling Cologne and Happosai.<p>"Um... Thanks... I think..." said Mousse while thinking, *It would be nice if they could help me. Sigh...*<p>*******************<p>Sneezing, a woman well known to the Masaki household looked around for a moment before returning to her work.<p>*******************<p>"Well now that we have that settled, how about we begin training Ranma?" said Cologne.<p>Smiling, Ranma nodded eagerly.<p>Confused for a moment, Mousse asked, "What's going on?"<p>Smirking, Cologne said, "I'm training my heir. As will Happosai."<p>"Your heir? But I thought Shampoo was your heir." said Mousse.<p>"She was and still is. However I see now that I will have to wait until she is fully ready to accept the responsibilities that come with being my heir. Ranma here is a pleasure to teach and will benefit much from the training Happosai and I will give him." said Cologne.<p>"And as the child of my goddess, it is my sworn duty to teach him all I can." said Happosai.<p>Blinking a moment, Mousse turned toward Ranma. "You know, somehow you being the child of a goddess does not surprise me." he said.<p>Chuckling a little bit, Ranma said, "Yeah, you know me. Just one surprise after another."<p>"Prepare yourself Ranma. It's time for your first lesson." said Cologne.<p>"Didn't Washu say to take it easy while you got used to your new body?" asked Ranma.<p>Smirking, Cologne replied, "I feel fine, and I can adapt quite quickly. Don't worry, I won't push myself too hard."<p>Nodding, Ranma said, "In that case, bring it on."<p>Stepping to the side, Mousse and Happosai watched as Cologne began her training of Ranma. It was relatively light compared to what Ranma was normally subjected to. But the two spectators could see that he was still enjoying the challenge of learning new things.<p>*******************<p>Meanwhile, up at the shrine...<p>Katsuhito and Tenchi stepped into the shrine office. Closing the door behind him, Katsuhito motioned for Tenchi to take a seat at the small table. Nodding, Tenchi sat and patiently waited while Katsuhito retrieved something from a nearby closet.<p>Tenchi only had a few brief moments to wonder what his grandfather was doing before Katsuhito returned, a small book in his hands. Sitting down, Katsuhito opened the small book and began looking for something. Tenchi assumed that his grandfather would begin speaking when he was ready. Until then, he would remain quiet and wait for his grandfather to begin speaking.<p>It only took a few moments for Katsuhito to find what he was looking for in the little book he held. The book was very special to him as it was one of the few things that had survived the crash of his ship during his battle with Ryoko many centuries previous. It was a book that contained many of the Juraian laws and customs, including the part of how many wives the Emperor is to have.<p>Marking the page with a piece of paper, Katsuhito looked up at Tenchi and studied him for a brief moment while he compiled his thoughts on the subject he would have to speak about. It was something he should have taught his grandson long ago. At the very least, he should have done this when Tenchi had found out that his own grandfather was Yosho, the warrior of legend.<p>Clearing his throat, Katsuhito began to speak, "Tenchi, I know that much has happened recently. I'm sure that you are still trying to get used to having a grandfather that looks no older than your father."<p>Nodding, Tenchi remained silent to listen to his grandfather speak.<p>Continuing on, Katsuhito said, "I'm sure you are wondering why Ryoko was quiet when Ayeka stated her intention to marry you. It probably confused you as it was not part of her normal behavior. There was a reason behind it and I believe that Ryoko has either learned or remembered about a certain Jurian custom."<p>Curious, Tenchi asked, "What custom is that?"<p>Smiling, Katsuhito replied, "This Juraian custom pertains only to the royal family of Jurai. Namely, the Emperor and whoever is next in line for the throne. You see, it is Juraian custom for the Emperor of Jurai to have at least two wives. If he has only one or has not married yet, many of the other houses would attempt to marry their daughters off to him."<p>As Katsuhito spoke, Tenchi finally began putting the pieces of the puzzle together. The reason Ryoko had been so quiet this morning. The reason he had two great grandmothers. A way that he could choose and make everyone happy.<p>"You mean?" said Tenchi, obviously a little overwhelmed with the prospects now known to him.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito replied, "Yes, as crown prince to the Juraian Empire, you are next in line for the throne. As such, you are entitled two wives."<p>"So that means?" said Tenchi.<p>"Yes, you could marry both Ayeka and Ryoko. However before you make that step, I wish to ask you a question." said Katsuhito.<p>"What is it?" asked Tenchi, a little curious as to what his grandpa wanted to ask him.<p>"I only wish to ask one question. Do you love them? Not the love of a friend for a friend, but the love of a husband for his wife." said Katsuhito.<p>Thinking for several moments, Tenchi thought about what his grandfather asked him. Did he truly love Ayeka and Ryoko as he would a wife. He thought about all their adventures together. The goods times and the bad. How each treated him and in turn how he treated them. He thought long and hard about how he felt for each. In the end, he could only look up and his grandfather and answer the question that had been asked.<p>Sighing, Tenchi replied, "I care about both of them equally. I would do anything for them if it meant they'd be happy. I wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt either of them. That was why I never decided. I didn't want to hurt either of them. If that is what love is, then yes, I do love them. I love them both equally. That was why I never could choose between them."<p>Smiling, Katsuhito said, "I just wanted to make sure that you understood your own feelings on the subject. I'd rather you marry of love than for political reasons. Now why don't you head down to the house and give Ayeka the answer that is in your heart and that she longs to hear."<p>Nodding, Tenchi rose and stepped over to the door before turning back to his grandfather. "Thanks Grandpa."<p>"It was no problem. Before you go, I have one other thing to give you. There's a couple of women waiting for your proposal and you will need something to give them." said Katsuhito before pulling two small boxes out of a pocket in his robes.<p>Taking the small boxes from his grandfather, Tenchi peeked inside to see a earring in each one. Confused, Tenchi looked back at his grandfather.<p>Smiling, Katsuhito said, "Those are Juraian engagement earrings. On Jurai, we would use earrings instead of rings as the rings were for assuming our combat armor. Ayeka will wear hers in her right ear to show she will be your first wife. Ryoko's will be in her left ear to show she will be your second wife."<p>Nodding, Tenchi put the two boxes into his pocket before thanking his grandfather again.<p>"No need to thank me. Now go, I'm sure that Ayeka is anxiously awaiting your return." said Katsuhito.<p>Nodding again, Tenchi opened the door to the shrine and began the journey back to the house. He had something important to do and he wanted to do it right.<p>Stepping up to the doors, Katsuhito watched as Tenchi returned to the house. He knew that Tenchi would make both Ayeka and Ryoko happy. Tsunami only knows how much both girls needed someone like his grandson.<p>So caught in his musings, he didn't notice Nodoka approach him.<p>"Ahem" said Nodoka, trying to get Katsuhito's attention.<p>Hearing the voice, Katsuhito was broken out of his thoughts. Glancing down slightly, he was met with the sight of Ranma's mother watching him.<p>Chuckling slightly, Katsuhito said, "Sorry about that. I was lost in my thoughts for a moment."<p>Smiling, Nodoka replied, "I figured as much."<p>"So what brings you here?" asked Katsuhito, curious as to why Ranma's mother had visited him.<p>"I was enjoying the scenery of the area. It is quite beautiful here." said Nodoka.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito replied, "Yes it is. I've lived here for many years and I never tire of the beauty of this valley. Things are usually very peaceful here. Although it has livened up with everyone staying at the house."<p>"Yes, they do seem like a lively bunch. I take it that most are not from around here?" said Nodoka.<p>Chuckling a little, Katsuhito said, "You could say that. I believe that my son in law and Tenchi are the only ones from Earth. And even then, my son in law is the only one that is fully human."<p>"Really? You could hardly tell just from looking." replied Nodoka.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito said, "Yes, many races in the galaxy have a similar appearance to humans. It's one of the mysteries of the universe. Anyway, would you like me to show you around the shrine grounds?"<p>Smiling, Nodoka nodded, "Yes, I would like that very much."<p>Stepping down into the courtyard, Katsuhito extended his elbow for Nodoka. Hooking her arm through his, she smiled up at him. "Quite the gentleman." she said.<p>Chuckling, Katsuhito replied, "Yes, well I did grow up learning proper etiquette. I am a prince after all."<p>Blinking a little, Nodoka replied, "A prince? You'll have to tell me sometime how a prince became a priest. I'm sure it's an interesting story."<p>Nodding, Katsuhito said, "Indeed. Although I have heard stranger tales in my days. In fact, I remember this one man I met long ago. He had long crimson hair and a cross shaped scar on his left cheek..."<p>Before Katsuhito could continue, Nodoka interrupted him, "Long crimson hair and a cross shaped scar on his left cheek? What was his name?"<p>Curious as to what she was talking about, Katsuhito replied to her question, "Kenshin Himura. Why do you ask?"<p>"What a small world this is. Kenshin Himura was my great grandfather." said Nodoka.<p>"Really? Very interesting." replied Katsuhito.<p>"I remember when I was a little girl, he'd always tell me tales of when he was younger. Although you could hardly tell how old he was. He always had crimson hair and that cross shaped scar. I remember asking him about that when I was a little older. All he said that was his family had very long lifespans. I never really understood what he meant by that." said Nodoka.<p>About that time they came upon Funaho, Yosho's space tree. The two gazed on it's beauty for a few moments before resuming their conversation.<p>"Could you tell me a little about him? I only really got to spend time with him while he trained me with the sword." said Nodoka.<p>Blinking again, Katsuhito asked, "Before I begin, tell me... Did he train you in the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryuu style?"<p>Nodding, Nodoka replied, "Yes he did. He made me promise to only use it to help people and that I should only teach it to my children. Why do you ask?"<p>Smiling, Katsuhito replied, "I was just curious. The style was a powerful one. The only other style I know of that was as powerful were the Juraian sword arts. I'm glad that the style had not been lost to time. It would have been a shame for that knowledge to be lost."<p>"He told me that was why he was teaching me. So that the knowledge would not die with him. When he spoke, it almost seemed like he somehow knew that it would be needed again." said Nodoka.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito replied, "Yes, he always did have an uncanny ability to know things. Not surprising really since he wasn't even human. Not sure what race he was though."<p>Blinking a moment, Nodoka asked, "What do you mean he wasn't human?"<p>"Err... well you see, when I first met him, he was still just a child. At the time he was learning how to use a sword from a friend of mine who was at the time, the current master of the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryuu. When I first saw the boy, I noticed he had an odd aura about him. It was powerful yet unfocused at the time. But one thing stood out most of all. It was not the aura of a human being." said Katsuhito.<p>"What was it then?" asked Nodoka, thoroughly captivated by the story of her ancestor.<p>"Even to this day, I'm not entirely sure. All I know is that it was very similar to a Juraian aura yet it was not Juraian." said Katsuhito.<p>"Anyway, tell me more about him. What he was like back then and what kind of friends he had." said Nodoka.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito continued to tell her about her great grandfather. He left nothing out. Not even the darker parts of her ancestor's life.<p>As the two talked, Funaho secretly scanned Nodoka. She was curious about what Yosho was talking about earlier. Similar to Juraian yet not Juraian. The results she got back came up inconclusive. However they were familiar to her. She'd seen them before. Not just in Ranma, but in another. Another that was still around.<p>*******************<p>Back at the house...<p>Stepping into the room, Tenchi looked around for the person he was in search of. After a few moments, he finally found her coming down the stairs. Stepping over to her, Tenchi took a deep breath before speaking.<p>"Ayeka, could I talk to you for a moment?" asked Tenchi.<p>"Of course Lord Tenchi. Where would you like to talk?" replied Ayeka.<p>"In the living room is fine." said Tenchi.<p>Entering the living room, Tenchi turned to Ayeka. "Ayeka, I just got done talking with my grandpa."<p>"How did it go?" asked Ayeka. Internally she sincerely hoped that Tenchi would ask her that one question she most wanted to hear.<p>Chuckling nervously, Tenchi said, "Well he explained some things to me that I didn't know about. Stuff I should have been able to figure out on my own."<p>"And what was that?" said Ayeka.<p>"Well, he explained to me some stuff about what is expected of me since I'm the heir to the throne. He told me that I can have more than one wife. And that it was Juraian custom to have at least two. Otherwise the other houses would be after me to marry their daughters." said Tenchi.<p>"You mean you didn't know?" asked Ayeka.<p>Shaking his head, Tenchi replied, "I didn't know at all. Nobody ever told me about it before."<p>Embarrassed slightly, Ayeka said, "I suppose that's my fault. I've been so busy fighting with that monster woman that I forgot to educate you in Juraian policies. I terribly sorry Lord Tenchi."<p>"Um... It's ok Ayeka. It's nobody's fault. I just never tried to learn more. But after talking with Grandpa, I've decided to learn as much as I can. That way I'll know about this stuff when I need it." said Tenchi.<p>"Lord Tenchi, forgive me for being presumptuous but are you saying what I think you are saying?" said Ayeka.<p>Gulping while sweating profusely, Tenchi said, "Ayeka, when you first arrived, I enjoyed that walk we had out by the sacred tree and overlooking the valley. It was peaceful and I enjoyed having your company."<p>"And then that monster woman showed up and ruined the moment." grumbled Ayeka.<p>"Ayeka, please let me finish first. And could you stop insulting Ryoko?" said Tenchi.<p>"Very well Lord Tenchi." replied Ayeka.<p>"As I was saying, I enjoyed your company that day. You were very kind to me. I've never had women interested in me before. I found that I liked it. As time passed, I found myself developing these feelings." said Tenchi.<p>Blushing a little at Tenchi's description of her, Ayeka asked, "What kind of feelings?"<p>"Well, I began to care about everybody as though they were my family. Sasami was the little sister I never had. Kiyone and Mihoshi were like close cousins. Washu was like that crazy aunt that every family has. Finally there was you and Ryoko. You were the first two I met and have known the longest." said Tenchi.<p>Keeping her calm at the mention of Ryoko, Ayeka asked, "And how do you feel about us?"<p>Sighing, Tenchi said, "I care about both of you, but not like the others. Ayeka, you are kind, intelligent, and very beautiful. While Ryoko is energetic, adventurous, and very beautiful. I care alot about you both. I've never really had anyone interested in me before but now that I have, I found myself at a dilemma. One that I couldn't figure out until just recently."<p>"Oh?" asked Ayeka, her thoughts racing. *It sounds like he does want to marry me, but was holding back because he cared about Ryoko too. But from the sounds of it, he means to marry us both! But could I share Tenchi with Ryoko? Do I want to let her marry into the Juraian royal family? I'm not really sure. But I'd rather share him with her than anyone else. At the very least, me and Ryoko can get along to a point. I suppose I can allow it if it's Lord Tenchi's wish though.* she thought.<p>"Yeah. I care alot about you both. And I didn't want to hurt one if I chose the other. That was why I never showed any preference one way or the other. But now that I've learned of this Juraian custom, I can marry you both and neither will be hurt." said Tenchi.<p>Excited, Ayeka said, "Enough with the speeches already. Just tell me what's in your heart."<p>Nodding, Tenchi pulled out a box while slipping down onto one knee. "Ayeka, will you do me the honor of becoming my first wife?" he asked before opening the box to reveal a Juraian engagement earring.<p>Her eyes shining, Ayeka took the earring out of the box and put it on her right ear showing that she would be his first wife.<p>Rising, Tenchi was ill prepared for Ayeka, unbecoming of a princess, to glomp onto him and give him a very big kiss. At first he struggled but before long he returned it awkwardly since it was his first time ever kissing a girl.<p>Just before their kiss was finished, the doorbell rang. Stepping out of the kitchen, Sasami smiled as she saw the earring in her sister's ear. Tenchi had finally asked Ayeka to marry him. She could only wonder when he'd ask Ryoko. Unlike many of the other residents, Sasami was quite perceptive and knew that Tenchi cared about both Ayeka and Ryoko equally. Passing through before they saw her, Sasami continued onward to see who was visiting.<p>As soon as Ayeka and Tenchi's kiss ended, Tenchi had a somewhat glazed expression on his face.<p>"Whoa..." he said, genuinely amazed.<p>Smiling at the affect she had on him, Ayeka said, "I agree."<p>Blushing a little, Tenchi said, "I'm sorry about the beginning there."<p>"It's alright dear. It'll get better with practice. And I know that you'll be getting plenty of it." said Ayeka before giving him a quick peck on lips.<p>Tenchi simply kept that goofy smile.<p>*******************<p>Arriving at the door, Sasami opened it to see who was knocking. As soon as she saw who it was, she was overcome with excitement and happiness.<p>"Mommy!" she yelled happily as she embraced her mother.<p>"My little Sasami!" yelled Misaki, her tears of happiness flowing freely as she glomped onto her little girl.<p>Behind Misaki, Azusa and Funaho simply stood and waited for the reunion to finish. Both knew that one never interrupts Misaki when she was in this kind of emotional state. Doing so was... detrimental to one's health.<p>As soon as mother and daughter were reunited, Sasami pulled Misaki further into the house. Behind them, Azusa and Funaho followed at a more dignified pace. Funaho smiled as she watched Sasami do something that very few people in the universe could do. Drag Misaki around. Azusa on the other hand retained his usual grumpy appearance. He was there for one purpose and one purpose only. To find out what happened with all the Juraian space trees. It had nothing to do with his wives wanting to see their children. Nope, nothing at all.<p>"Ayeka! Look who's here!" shouted Sasami as she entered the living room. Misaki close behind.<p>"Who is it Sasami?" asked Ayeka as she began to turn around from talking with Tenchi.<p>As soon as her eyes laid sight upon Misaki, Ayeka gulped loudly. Leaning over, she whispered to Tenchi, "Lord Tenchi, I'm afraid I must do something that will not be very proper."<p>Confused, Tenchi whispered back, "What do you mean?"<p>"You will see. Just remember, that it is still me." whispered Ayeka back to Tenchi.<p>Still confused, Tenchi decided to watch and see what she meant.<p>Upon seeing Ayeka, Misaki's eyes began to sparkle with unshed tears. Ayeka's eyes too took on the same appearance but for different reasons. Slowly the two began to approach one another.<p>In a high pitched whiny voice, Ayeka said, "Mommy! My Mommy!"<p>"My little Ayeka!" said Misaki, her voice taking on a longing sound.<p>"Mommy!" said Ayeka in the same nasally whiny voice.<p>"Ayeka!" said Misaki.<p>This continued for another few moments as the two approached one another. Finally they embraced as Misaki showed how much she missed her little girl. Tenchi sweatdropped as he watched the drama unfold and as Ayeka's face began to take on the same color as her hair. Just as he was about to step in and try to save Ayeka, a voice stopped him.<p>"Hey Sasami, have ya seen mom anywhere around? I've looked all over the house and I can't find her." asked Ranma as she entered the room in her female form.<p>Misaki looked up to see an incredibly cute female with red and silvery blue hair enter the room. Her mind, using it standard programming, kicked in at that instant. The programming was relatively simple and basic.<p>***Misaki's Mind***<p>Start Program:<p>10 Input something cute.<br/>20 Is it cuter than what currently is in arms?<br/>30 If no, then ignore for now.<br/>40 If yes, then Goto line 60.<br/>50 If no object is in arms, then goto line 70.<br/>60 Shove object in arms aside. Goto line 70<br/>70 Glomp onto cute thing. Goto line 80.<br/>80 Output "You... Are... So... Cute!"<p>End Program.<p>***Running away from Misaki's Mind***<p>Just as Ranma turned to see Misaki, Ayeka disappeared from within her arms to become one with the wall. Sweatdropping at the sight of Ayeka embracing the wall with all her being, Ranma didn't see Misaki coming until too late. Quickly, Misaki glomped onto Ranma in an attempt to crush Ranma in one of her patented hugs.<p>Her eyes sparkly, Misaki looked into Ranma's eyes and said, "You... Are... So... Cute!"<p>Upon seeing the look in Misaki's eyes and being reminded oh so much of Asusa Shiratori, Ranma acked and began running back and forth yelling, "Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!"<p>Over by Ayeka, Tenchi watched this newest scene with a sweatdrop that threatened to flood the house. Frankly, he wouldn't have believed it if he didn't see it. Ranma, arguably one of the most power beings on the planet was running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. Then again, he couldn't really fault Ranma for it. Misaki was scary in his book too when she got like that.<p>Finally, Ranma managed to get enough leverage to disengage Misaki from her body and send the Juraian empress sailing across the room and through the wall adjoining the hallway.<p>Seeing her mother thrown across a room and through a wall, Sasami yelled, "Mommy!"<p>Upon hearing her little sister yell mommy, Ranma had only one thought on her mind at that moment. *Oh Shit...*<p>*******************<p>A few minutes earlier...<p>Azusa and Funaho were just about to enter the living room when a voice stopped them. Turning, they were greeted with the sight of Katsuhito, minus his disguise field, escorting a woman into the house. Both rose eyebrows for several reasons.<p>Funaho because her son didn't have his disguise field on for one thing. Also because her son was escorting a female of similar age. One thought raced through her mind in that instant. *I'm going to be a grandmother again!*<p>Azusa too wondered why his son decided to deactivate his disguise field. He gave his wayward son some slack when last he visited. This time however, he was not in such a forgiving mood. He had questions and he wanted answers.<p>"Mother? Father? What brings you here?" asked Katsuhito as he stepped up to Azusa and Funaho. Nodoka by his side.<p>"What's the matter son? Can't a mother come visit her son?" said Funaho with a smile.<p>"Of course. It's just a little unexpected. That's all." replied Katsuhito.<p>"We didn't come here for a visit. We came to get some answers." said Azusa, his visage as grumpy as ever.<p>Curious, Katsuhito replied, "Oh? And what is the question?"<p>"This is not the time for that dear. I want to visit with our children right now. That can wait until later." said Funaho, her voice filled with enough ice to freeze an ocean solid and a glare that said 'Don't even thing about crossing me'.<p>Gulping, Azusa replied, "Yes dear."<p>Turning to Katsuhito, Funaho smiled and asked, "Now then, who is this lovely young lady by your side?"<p>Blushing a little, Nodoka bowed before replying, "My name is Nodoka Himura. It is a pleasure to meet you your highness."<p>Smiling, Funaho said, "The pleasure is all mine. I am Funaho of the house Masaki. First empress of the Juraian empire. And this is my husband."<p>When he didn't speak up, Funaho elbowed him in the ribs. Casting a quick annoyed glance at his wife, Azusa spoke up.<p>"And I am Azusa of the house Masaki. Emperor of the Juraian empire." said Azusa while rubbing the spot his wife elbowed him.<p>Turning to Katsuhito, Nodoka asked, "Isn't your tree named Funaho?"<p>Nodding, Katsuhito said, "Yes, mother named her when she was just a sapling."<p>Seeing how close her son and Nodoka were standing to one another, Funaho smiled before asking, "So tell me son, when is the wedding?"<p>Turning toward his mother, a curious Katsuhito asked, "How did you find out? And which wedding are you referring to?"<p>Blinking a moment, Funaho said, "You mean there is more than one?"<p>Nodding, Katsuhito replied, "Yes, there are two currently being planned. Possibly even three."<p>"Who's getting married?" she asked, genuinely curious.<p>Thinking about it a moment, Katsuhito replied, "Well, Ayeka has finally managed to get Tenchi to ask her for her hand in marriage."<p>"He has! Oh that is wonderful news! I'm sure Misaki will be very happy! What about the others?" said Funaho.<p>His eyes narrowing, Azusa decided to have a little... chat... with Tenchi later on.<p>"Depending on how things turn out, Tenchi and Ryoko might be getting married as well. I know that Tenchi cares for both of them deeply and I suspect that Ryoko has developed feelings for Ayeka. I know she loves Tenchi as well." said Katsuhito.<p>Smiling, Funaho said, "It would seem that Tenchi has finally decided. I'm very proud of him. I'm sure that he will be very happy with both of them."<p>Azusa simply hmpff'd.<p>"I bet I can guess the third one." said Funaho.<p>"Oh? And who do you think is getting married?" asked Katsuhito.<p>"Why you and Nodoka of course!" she said happily.<p>Blinking at his mother a moment, he looked back and forth between Nodoka and his mother.<p>Nodoka blushed at what Funaho was implying. She had just gotten divorced. She wasn't ready for a relationship yet. Then again, her ex husband wasn't around for ten years. Plus Katsuhito was cute. Maybe there were possibilities there.<p>Blushing a little, Katsuhito said, "We are not engaged mother. In fact, we only just met today." He was embarrassed at what his mother had tried to imply. Especially in front of Nodoka. He was hundreds of years older than her. However she was very beautiful. Perhaps there were possibilities there.<p>A little saddened, Funaho asked, "Well then who is getting married?"<p>"Cologne, a very old friend of mine has finally gotten her first love to marry her. Actually by the laws of her village, they are already married. But she want's to have a formal ceremony as well." replied Katsuhito.<p>"What's the groom's name?" asked Funaho.<p>"His name is Happosai." replied Katsuhito before thinking.<p>Narrowing her eyes, Funaho said, "Who was the groom again?"<p>"Um... nobody important. Nobody at all." said Katsuhito while mentally kicking himself.<p>"I distinctly remember you saying the man's name was Happosai. Do not try to lie to me son." said Funaho.<p>Sighing, Katsuhito replied, "I'm sorry mother. Yes, his name is Happosai, and yes, he is the same one you are thinking of."<p>"I thought he had perished long ago." said Funaho.<p>"Where have I heard that name before?" said Azusa, deep in contemplation.<p>"You remember him dear. About three hundred years ago he was the head combat instructor for the palace guards." said Funaho.<p>"Ah, yes I do remember him. We used to go drinking occasionally till one day he disappeared. I never did find out what happened to him." said Azusa, a little happier since he might get to see one of his drinking buddies.<p>"Oh yes, I remember now. We never did tell you." said Funaho.<p>"Tell me what?" asked Azusa.<p>"Well, he stole a couple pairs of Misaki's panties. She was so angry, that she blocked his ability to use the power of Jurai and the water of life. Then she dumped him on this planet to die." said Funaho.<p>Blinking a moment, Azusa replied, "He stole some of Misaki's panties and because of that she risked Tsunami's anger by doing something that was forbidden?"<p>"What? What do you mean by forbidden?" asked Funaho, genuinely confused.<p>Sighing, Azusa said, "As Emperor of Jurai, I must be familiar with all of Tsunami's teachings as well as her laws. One of which forbids any Juraian from sealing away the gift that she had given our people. Any Juraian that does so will be subject to her anger and will face her judgment for punishment. It's on obscure rule that few know about since very few are strong enough to do it. It never occurred to me to tell you or Misaki about it since I didn't think either of you were strong enough to be able to do it. I may not like what Happosai did, but Misaki went too far."<p>"Oh no." said Funaho. Worry shone on her face for her co-wife.<p>"Yes, Misaki will have to face Tsunami's judgment. I can only pray that our goddess is lenient."<p>"I don't think you will have to worry about that." said Katsuhito.<p>"Oh? And why not? She broke one of Tsunami's rules and will have to face the consequences." replied Azusa.<p>"I'm afraid he is right son. As much as it pains me to agree." said Funaho.<p>Smiling, Katsuhito said, "Tsunami has already forgiven Misaki for her actions and what she's done to him has been undone. However, Misaki will have to apologize to Happosai for what she did. Because of what she did, Happosai has lost a couple hundred years of his life."<p>Curious, Funaho asked, "How do you know that our goddess has forgiven Misaki? And how was what she did undone?"<p>Chuckling, Katsuhito said, "We were informed about it just before what was done to him was fixed. In fact, I suspect that it's related to why father came here in the first place."<p>Raising an eyebrow, Azusa commanded, "Explain."<p>"In due time. Later we can discuss it." said Katsuhito.<p>"Why not now?" asked Azusa, a little peeved he couldn't get his answer right away.<p>"Because I want Misaki to hear it at the same time. Do not worry. Misaki will be fine. Remember that Tsunami has forgiven her." said Katsuhito.<p>"Very well. As soon as Misaki joins us, we will discuss this matter." said Azusa, relenting for now.<p>Nodding, Katsuhito looked around before asking, "Where is Misaki?"<p>Before anyone could answer, a flying object came crashing through the wall. Dust swirled as the four in the hallway tried to see what interrupted them. As the dust cleared, the form of Misaki could be seen slumped against the wall opposite the hole. She seemed a bit dazed but otherwise fine.<p>"Mommy!" shouted Sasami as she came running into the hallway.<p>Behind Sasami, Ranma came running. Upon seeing Misaki's slumped form and Sasami beginning to cry, Ranma said, "Oh man. I didn't mean for that to happen."<p>Before Azusa could lay into Ranma, Misaki began to stir. Opening her eyes, she was greeted to the sight of her little Sasami beginning to cry. Lifting her arm, she put a hand on Sasami's shoulder. "I'm alright dear. No need to cry." she said.<p>Happy that her mother was alright, Sasami gave her mother a big hug.<p>Stepping forward, Ranma said, "I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that."<p>Turning her vision toward Ranma, Misaki's eyes grew hard. Half snarling, she rose.<p>Gulping, Ranma began to back away slowly. Quickly she retreated into the living room, Misaki following angrily.<p>"I'm really sorry about that." said Ranma, desperately trying to appease the vengeful woman in front of her.<p>Misaki ignored the apologies and glared at the person that made her little Sasami cry. She didn't mind going through the wall. She had worse when she was younger. No, she was angry because the person in front of her dared to make her little Sasami cry! Summoning her power, several logs appeared around Ranma. Misaki could use several attacks, but this would hold Ranma until she could think of the appropriate punishment for the crime of making her little Sasami cry.<p>As the logs appeared, Ranma was reminded of Ayeka's attack the other night. Ayeka's didn't hurt at all and was quite pleasurable. She wasn't sure on what kind of pleasure since she'd never felt it before. Briefly she wondered if this would be the same just before the logs activated.<p>Azusa, Funaho, Katsuhito, Nodoka, and Sasami came up to the entrance of the living room a mere moment before Misaki activated her attack. Before they could attempt to stop her, the attack was activated.<p>Powerful arcs of lightning raced back and forth from the logs to Ranma's body. At first, there was no noticeable affect other than Ranma blinking a little at the light show which appeared to her, more powerful than the one from the previous evening. However that quickly changed as a powerful wave of pleasure overcame her very being.<p>The spectators could only watch as Misaki's attack began to affect Ranma in a most unusual manner. To them, Ranma had been perfectly fine. The attack had not affected Ranma at all. Azusa and Funaho were stunned to find that the attack had not affected the girl in the slightest. At least they were at first. Then they, along with the other's began to blush. Ranma was now being affected by the attack. Only not in the way it was intended to.<p>Ranma gasped as pleasure assaulted her. Unconsciously she let out a small moan as her hands roamed her body, seeking out what felt best. With her eyes closed, she did not realize that others were watching her. However at the moment, she didn't care if the whole world was watching her. This feeling was unlike anything she had ever felt before and she wanted to enjoy it as long as it lasted.<p>Nodoka watched in shock as her child was in the throws of pleasure. Blushing, she decided to give Ranma a little talk later on. Remembering how Genma had raised Ranma, she was sure that her child had no idea what she was experiencing.<p>Tenchi took one look at the scene before him and promptly fainted. A small river of blood flowing out of his nose. Ayeka shook her head at her beloved and made plans to remedy his shyness as soon as possible. Turning her attention back toward the display, Ayeka blushed while she wondered when her mother would stop defiling Ranma. Although from the looks of things, the child of her goddess was loving every minute of it.<p>Meanwhile, a certain architect had just arrived home from work early. Glancing into the living room, he was met with the sight of Ranma in the throws of passion. A glint in his glasses appeared as he quickly retrieved his video camera. What kind of man would he be if he let this opportunity pass him by!<p>Quickly returning to the scene, Nobuyuki began recording the event in the living room. Tears flowed like waterfalls as his long wait had finally paid off.<p>Nodoka glanced to the side and saw Tenchi's father video taping her child. After this was over, she planned to confront him and confiscate that tape. She didn't want perverts using her child for their jolly's. For now, she'd let him record the event. It would do her some good later when she went to explain to Ranma what had happened.<p>Ranma could feel something building. What, she didn't know. All she knew was that a pressure was building within her. Building higher and higher. She thought she was going to burst from the pressure. However her body had other uses for that feeling.<p>The spectators gasped as something new happened. Shimmering into view behind Ranma, as though growing out of her back, were ten wings of light. Azusa and Funaho stared in shock as the wings appeared. They knew what they were. The wings of the light hawk. However what worried them more was that there were ten of them. Both knew that Tenchi could call them forth. Even then, he could only use three. However this girl was connected with their goddess somehow. Neither knew how, only that this girl was probably what brought them here in the first place.<p>Opening her eyes, everyone could see them glowing purple. Higher and higher the glow rose until it reached it's limit. With a cry of sheer ecstasy, the energy was released.<p>*******************<p>Viewing the house from the outside, anyone that would happen to pass by would notice that the house was enveloped in a sea of power. If they stayed around long enough, they would be witness to the child of a goddess having her first orgasm.<p>*******************<p>All the windows in the house blew out from the power that was running rampant within. A wave of power exploded outward from Ranma, passing through all the spectators. Each spectator could feel a sense of peace, tranquility, and most of all, satisfaction.<p>Finally, Misaki stopped her attack as the wave passed by her. Blinking a moment, she wondered what happened. One moment she was attacking the girl that had made her Sasami cry, and the next she felt as if she had a repeat of her honeymoon.<p>Glancing at the girl she was attacking, Misaki's eyes nearly bugged out as she caught sight of the ten wings just before they faded away. She too knew what they were but not what they signified. Only that the child was connected to her goddess. A war raged on within her. On one hand, the girl made Sasami cry. On the other hand, the girl had connections to Tsunami. Both sides fought for dominance. In the end, she could only do one thing. She fainted.<p>Coming down from her high, Ranma had a silly little grin on her face. She'd been taken to heaven and she enjoyed the whole ride there. Opening her eyes, she slowly looked around for a moment. Seeing everybody watching her, Ranma blushed before chuckling nervously.<p>She noticed his mother had an odd look on her face. Like she was thinking of talking about something important later on. Everyone else were in various states of blushing. Tenchi though was passed out. So was the woman that was attacking him. Sasami had a little smile on her face with sparkling eyes. Ayeka was blushing like mad while trying to take care of Tenchi.<p>Azusa was the first to step forward. For the first time in centuries, he was nervous. And for good reason. Here, in front of him, was a girl that could control the full power of the wings. And his wife had just defiled her.<p>Shakily, he began to speak, "W..W..W.. Who are you?"<p>Turning to Azusa, Ranma rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. Scanning his aura quickly, she determined he was Juraian. Remembering what his mother told him to do when introducing himself to somebody from Jurai, Ranma bowed slightly before speaking.<p>"Ranma, of the house Tsunami. Sorry about this." said Ranma.<p>*******************<p>Elsewhere, a goddess was brooding over the information that she had just received. She would have to rectify the situation as soon as possible, less her niece/nephew learns the true extent of the power she could control.<p>Unbeknownst to her, a small pig was wandering near the door to Nabiki's quarters. It wondered how it got to Texas just before it was picked up by it's bandana. Soon it's eyes met those of it's captor.<p>"Hello Ryoga. Let's talk." said Nabiki with an evil smile on her face as she entered her quarters.<p>*******************<p>TBC...<p>Author's Notes:<p>Ranma and Azusa, face to face at last. However what will happen now? Will Azusa be able to accept the truth about Ranma? What of Misaki? What fate lies in store for her? When will Ranma receive THE talk? How long will it take for Tenchi to propose to Ryoko? And where are Washu and the Nerimianites? What evil fate does Nabiki have in store for Ryoga? And what will Tokimi do? What happened to that video tape! And what secrets do Washu's scans reveal about Ranma's family? All this and more in the next chapter of: Child of the Goddess!<p></p>
