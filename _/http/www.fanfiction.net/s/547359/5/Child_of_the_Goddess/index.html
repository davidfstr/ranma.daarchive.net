</div><p>Child of the Goddess<br/>Chapter 4<p>By: Gekigengar3<p>Disclaimer: All characters, and such are the copyrights and property of their respective owners. I claim no ownership of any character and such in any way.<p>"" = Spoken words<br/>** = Thoughts<br/>= Telephone<p>At a shrine in the country, a aged priest meditated a little before retiring for the evening. His meditations were interrupted however by the ringing of a phone. Standing up, the priest walked over and answered the phone, "Moshi Moshi. Masaki Shrine."<p>"Wo Ai Ni Airen" spoke an old voice.<p>It took a moment for him to place the words and the significance, but when he did, the image of a woman in various states of age appeared in his mind. "Cologne-chan! What a pleasant surprise. Still kicking around I see." he said while chuckling<p>"Yes, there's still a lot of life left in this ole girl yet." said Cologne.<p>"And you know darn well I've never been your Airen." chided Katshuhito.<p>"A girl can still dream, can't she?" chuckled Cologne.<p>Chuckling, Katshuhito asked, "So, what do I owe the pleasure of this call?"<p>Turning a little serious, Cologne spoke, "Yosho, I wish to come pay a visit. It's been a long time and I'd like to see how you are doing. I also wish to bring a student of mine along as well."<p>Thinking about it a moment, Katshuhito thought, *Hmm, it's been a while since I've last seen her. However I do not know how her student will react to all the off world visitors we have here. She however is already aware of my alien heritage.*<p>"I'd love for you to visit Cologne-chan, but right now we have a few 'out-of-town' guests staying here at the moment." said Katshuhito emphasizing the words 'out-of-town'.<p>"Do not worry Yosho. I believe my student is already aware of people from 'out-of-town' as you say. But I still wish to bring them with me when I visit. It is of great importance." spoke Cologne.<p>"Very well then. I don't see much problem with that if they know what is going on. However I do have to ask one thing. You said it was of great importance that your student accompanies you. Why is that?" asked Katshuhito.<p>"I'd rather not say over the phone but I will give you a hint. It involves your heritage and wings of light." answered Cologne cryptically.<p>His demeanor turning serious, Katshuhito asked, "Are you sure?"<p>"Yes, I am. I will explain more when we arrive." said Cologne.<p>"Very well" replied Katshuhito.<p>"We will leave tomorrow. Hopefully we will be there in the late afternoon to early evening." said Cologne.<p>"Alright, I will make sure we are ready for your arrival then. Until tomorrow." said Katshuhito.<p>"Until tomorrow" said Cologne.<p>With a click, Cologne hung up the phone and began to prepare for Ranma's arrival.<p>Meanwhile at the Masaki shrine, Katshuhito had some very important things to do. The first being to inform the others of the visitors that would be arriving tomorrow. Getting up and making sure it wasn't too late, he proceeded to the house. Descending the stairs, he had time to ponder the things Cologne told him.<p>*So, Tsunami's child has been found. And by one of my oldest friends too. Very intriguing. Though it does make some sense. Cologne-chan is from China after all. Still, I wonder how they ended up meeting. I will have to ask her tomorrow when she arrives. I'm sure Sasami will be very happy. She's been looking forward to this for a while. It also might relieve Washu's headache a little. Trying to track down Tsunami's child has been very tiring on her.* thought the old priest as he arrived at the bottom of the stairs.<p>In the house, everyone was more or less being quiet. Most everybody was gathered around the television enjoying some evening programming. Sasami was in the kitchen cleaning up from diner and Washu was sitting at the table. Her computer was in front of her and a few bottles of Washu brand aspirin could be seen sitting nearby.<p>Massaging her temples, Washu once again tried to locate Tsunami's child. *Ok, I know this should not be this hard. I mean, someone that is that powerful should be leaking power. Ayeka, Sasami, Ryoko, Yosho, and Tenchi all leak enough power to allow me to track them. Even I leak enough to track. But this kid is barely leaking anything. Sigh. Just when I pickup the faintest trace of them, they disappear. Humph, reminds me of Mihoshi sometimes. I suppose I should take a break from this. Maybe Sasami has something to snack on.*<p>Shutting down her computer, Washu stood up and headed for the kitchen to get a snack. Arriving at the kitchen, Washu saw Sasami cleaning the last of the dishes. Ryo-Ohki was sitting on the counter nearby munching on a carrot.<p>"Sasami, is there any food leftover from diner?" asked Washu.<p>Stopping her work a moment, Sasami smiled and nodded to Washu, "Yeah, there are some leftovers in the fridge."<p>Nodding, Washu grabbed a few pieces of food from the fridge.<p>Finished with the dishes, Sasami removed her apron and asked Washu, "Washu, have you had any luck locating my new sister?"<p>Sighing, Washu answered, "I'm sorry Sasami. I haven't yet. Just when I think I have a fix on her, she disappears. It's unusual in a way. I can track almost anyone in this house anywhere on the planet. But Tsunami's child is almost impossible to track. It's like they have the ability to hide their power."<p>Thinking to herself a moment, Sasami responded, "Oh! I almost forgot. Tsunami told me that her child was nearly impossible to detect due to the methods of which she used to have one in the first place. It's only when her child uses larger amounts of power that they are able to be detected."<p>Banging her head on the fridge a moment, Washu looked over at Sasami, "It would have been nice if I had known that earlier. I might have spared myself a headache."<p>Sheepishly, Sasami said, "I'm sorry Washu. I hope your not angry at me. I just forgot."<p>Smiling, Washu shook her head, "No, I'm not angry at you Sasami. I just would have liked to spare myself this headache."<p>Nodding, Sasami smiled.<p>Done in the kitchen, Sasami picked up Ryo-Ohki and accompanied Washu into the living room just as the door slid open to reveal Katshuhito. Everyone turned and looked at him a moment before resuming their own activities.<p>Stepping in, Katshuhito looked around a moment before spotting Washu and Sasami coming out of the kitchen. Stepping over to them, he said, "Sasami, Washu, I have some information for you ."<p>Both nodding, they proceed to the table where Katshuhito told them, "I just received a phone call from a very old friend of mine. She said she was coming to visit and that she was going to bring a student of hers as well. They are going to arrive here sometime late tomorrow afternoon to early evening."<p>"Why did you have to tell us Katshuhito?" asked Washu.<p>"Well you see, she didn't say why she was bringing her student but she did give me a hint. She said that it involved my heritage and wings of light." answered Katshuhito.<p>Both Sasami and Washu froze for a moment before they both asked, "You mean!"<p>Nodding, Katshuhito said, "Yes, I believe her student to be Tsunami's child. However she said that she would tell me more when she arrived."<p>Sasami rejoiced, "Yay! I finally get to meet my new sister!"<p>At the same time, Washu rejoiced, "Yes! I finally get to meet my new guinea pig!"<p>Both Katshuhito and Sasami blinked at Washu a moment. Sheepishly, Washu rubbed the back of her head. "Sorry, got caught up in the moment."<p>"Good. Tsunami doesn't want you hurting her child." responded Sasami with a more mature tone in her voice.<p>Washu simply nodded while vowing that she would study the child that eluded her for so long. She would study her. Oh yes, she would study her.<p>"What's going on?" asked Tenchi as Sasami's squeals of joy caught everyone's attention.<p>Answering, Katshuhito said, "We will be having visitors arriving tomorrow evening. I want you all on your best behavior. One of them will is a very old friend of mine. The other is her student."<p>Nodding, everyone went back to watching television. Turning a curious look to Katshuhito, Washu asked, "Why didn't you tell them?"<p>"I didn't want to get them all excited just yet. I want to talk to my old friend and her student before we tell them." responded Katshuhito.<p>Nodding, Washu agreed, "Yes, I believe you are right in that aspect. I'd also like to be there when you talk to them. As I believe Sasami will want to be."<p>Giving her biggest and most enthusiastic nod, Sasami said, "Yep."<p>Smiling at the two bundles of energy, Katshuhito nodded, "Very well. I will inform you upon their arrival. Until then I believe we should all get some sleep. Until tomorrow."<p>Getting up, Katshuhito left while Sasami and Washu walked off to their own rooms. Each was looking forward to tomorrow.<p>Meanwhile in Nerima...<p>Ranma had just arrived at the Nekohanten. Stepping inside, he prepared himself for another of Shampoo's patented amazon glomp's. When none came, he curiously looked around only to spot Cologne sitting in a booth sipping tea. Across from her was Happosai. Motioning Ranma over, Cologne waited for him to arrive and sit down.<p>Sitting down next to Happosai, Ranma looked at them both a moment before speaking, "Where's Shampoo and what did you want to see me for?"<p>Shaking her head at Ranma's lack of tact, Cologne chuckled.<p>"Shampoo and Mousse are gone for the evening on some very long deliveries. As for what I wanted to talk with you about. Well, I wanted to talk to you about the events that transpired at Phoenix mountain." said Cologne.<p>Happi decided to add his two bits in, "Yeah, and I want to know why your aura has changed to Jurian energy?"<p>Both looked at Happosai a moment.<p>"How do you know about Jurian energy?" asked Cologne.<p>"Yeah!" quipped Ranma.<p>Chuckling, Happi decided to tell them about his origins and how he ended up here.<p>*****************<p>After he was finished, Ranma and Cologne shook their heads.<p>"It would figure that only you would do something like that Happi." said Cologne while chuckling a little bit.<p>"You really are a pervert." added Ranma.<p>Brushing off Ranma's statement, Happi asked, "So tell me Ranma, why is your aura now Jurian energy?<p>"I would like to know about that as well Ranma." said Cologne.<p>Sighing, Ranma proceeded to tell them what happened in his mind at phoenix mountain. About the hawk which was his Jurian power. About the Panther which was the Neko-ken. And the joining. To say they were shocked when he finished was an understatement.<p>"That was quite amazing Ranma." said Cologne.<p>"Indeed" agreed Happosai.<p>"That's not all." said Ranma sadly.<p>Curious, both the old timers asked him, "What else?"<p>"Remember the part I told you where the hawk told me that Genma is not my father and that it was locked away due to Genma's teaching me the Neko-Ken?" said Ranma.<p>Both elders nodded.<p>"Well you see, if he had not trained me in that technique, then I would have been able to save Akane easily. It's because of that fat Panda that she is dead." stated Ranma, a lone tear running down his cheek.<p>Cologne was just about to offer Ranma a supportive comment when a very hot aura burst forth, nearly setting the table on fire. Both Ranma and Cologne looked over to see a very angry yet shell shocked Happosai...<p>"A...A...Akane-chan is dead? N...N...No more of Akane's panties?...GENMA! I'm going to rip him limb from limb for training you in that technique! If it wasn't for him then my Akane-chan would still be alive!" said an enraged Happosai.<p>"NO! YOU WILL DO NO SUCH THING! THE PANDA IS MINE AND MY MOTHER'S TO DEAL WITH. NOBODY ELSE'S! WE SHALL BE THE ONES TO PUNISH HIM!" shouted Ranma. His eyes glowing a disturbing purple color.<p>Both Cologne and Happosai flinched at Ranma's outburst. They would have said more but the glowing eyes stopped them. It unnerved both of them. Both could feel the power in those eyes and neither wanted to face it.<p>Nodding, Happosai said, "Very well Ranma. But until you deal with him, I will make his life miserable."<p>His eyes returning to their new Blue-Red color, Ranma smiled and nodded, "I couldn't ask for anything more."<p>"Well, now that you two have that settled, I do have one other question Ranma." said Cologne.<p>"Yes?" replied Ranma.<p>"How were you able to form the Wings of the Light Hawk?" asked Cologne.<p>Happosai's eyes went wide at that, "WHAT! He can summon the Light Hawk Wings?"<p>Ranma blinked at Happi a moment before answering Cologne, "Well you remember when I told you of the hawk and it being the representation of my heritage and power?"<p>Receiving dual nods, Ranma continued, "Well after talking with my mother earlier, I learned that the hawk was the essence or soul of a child that was killed by a great darkness long ago. Apparently it was the child of a Goddess or something like that."<p>Cologne blinked at that little piece of information. *It would figure that something like this would happen to him. The boy somehow draws power and chaos to him. Despite that, he will truly be a great asset to the tribe. To think, a child of a Goddess in the tribe!*<p>Happosai on the other hand had a different reaction. His face paled a little bit and his eyes were as wide as saucers. Leaping to the floor, he did something that neither Cologne or Ranma had seen him do before. He kneeled to Ranma.<p>"My Lord, I, Happosai of the house Agemi, am your humble servant. Your wish is my command." stated Happosai.<p>Bewildered, Ranma said, "What are you talking about?"<p>Cologne nodded her head as well, curious as to why Happi would react this way.<p>Rising, Happi bowed and said, "My Lord. You are the child of Tsunami, the Goddess to our people. Your word is the word of our Goddess. Your command is law. Not even the Emperor himself can oppose your will."<p>Shaking his head, Ranma mumbled, "Great. Just when I thought my life couldn't get any weirder. I wonder what's next."<p>Somewhere, a red headed scientist sneezed.<p>Back at the Nekohanten, Ranma sighed, "Very well, if that's the case then stop calling me Lord. I hate honorifics like that. Just call me Ranma."<p>Nodding, Happosai said, "Very well My Lo...Errr...Ranma."<p>Cologne chuckled a little bit at this new revelation. Deciding to save Ranma from a obedient Happosai, she spoke up. "Ranma?"<p>"Yes?" replied Ranma as Happi took his seat next to Ranma again.<p>"Tomorrow, I'd like to take you to meet an old friend of mine. His name is Katshuhito Masaki. He's a priest at a temple about a half day's journey from here. I believe he might be able to help you with your new heritage." said Cologne.<p>"How's a priest supposed to help me with something not of this world?" asked a bewildered Ranma.<p>Chuckling again, Cologne said, "Because Ranma, he is Jurian like yourself and Happi."<p>Perking up at this, Happi asked, "He is? What's his Jurian name?"<p>Looking over at Happi, Cologne said, "His Jurian name is Yosho. Why?"<p>"I don't believe it! He's still alive!" half shouted Happosai.<p>"Who's Yosho?" Ranma asked Happi.<p>"My Lo...err Ranma. Yosho was the crown prince of Jurai. About 700 years ago, he left to do battle with a space pirate that had attacked the planet. He never returned and has been missing ever since." stated Happi.<p>"So this Yosho guy is some sort of prince and he supposedly can help me?" asked Ranma.<p>Nodding, Cologne said, "Yes. I just called him earlier and he will be expecting us tomorrow evening. He also said he has a few out-of-town visitors which can only mean they are not from this planet."<p>Nodding, Ranma agreed, "Ok, I guess I'll meet you here tomorrow morning then. I'll have to tell my mom where I'm going."<p>Cologne nodded, "Very well Ranma. Till tomorrow."<p>Nodding, Ranma got up to leave. Before he was able to leave, Happi said, "Hold up Ranma. I'll walk with you."<p>Nodding to the diminutive martial artist, Ranma waited while he said bye to Cologne. Once finished, the two left the Nekohanten. Cologne watched them leave before going to pack for their trip the next day.<p>*****************<p>On their way back to the Tendo Dojo, Happosai offered Ranma something he'd never offered another.<p>"Ranma?" said Happosai.<p>"Yeah?" replied Ranma.<p>"Ranma, I'd like to impart to you all my knowledge of the art. All the techniques I've developed over the years. These also include some Jurian sword techniques that I developed but never passed on to anyone. I might not be able to use a sword anymore, but I can still teach you them." said Happosai with complete honesty.<p>Ranma nearly tripped at Happosai's offer.<p>Recomposing himself, Ranma asked, "What's the catch?"<p>Shaking his head, Happosai said, "Ranma, I'm getting old. I might be Jurian, but without the energy of Jurai and the water of life, I can only last so long. I want to pass my knowledge to an heir whom is worthy of the knowledge and burden of them before I pass on. I want you to be that heir. You are the only one that is worthy of it."<p>A little bit awed that Happosai would think so highly of him, Ranma nodded, "I am honored you consider me worthy of your secrets sensei. I hope to do you proud."<p>Happosai nearly had a heart attack right there. Ranma called him sensei! "No Ranma, it is I who is honored to pass my knowledge unto the child of our Goddess."<p>Smiling and shaking his head, Ranma said, "So will you be coming with me and Cologne tomorrow?"<p>Thinking a moment, Happosai nodded, "Yes, I believe I will. But first I have a little present for Genma."<p>His interest perked, Ranma asked, "Oh? What kind of present?"<p>Chuckling, Happosai said, "Oh not much. Just the kind that will make it so he won't be able to stand the smell or taste of properly cooked food. The more tasty and good smelling it is, the more he won't be able to stand it."<p>Laughing out loud, Ranma agreed, "Yeah! That'll be a good temporary punishment for him until I'm ready!"<p>"I'm glad you agree Ranma." said Happosai.<p>They both walked the rest of the way to the Tendo Dojo discussing minor things. Once there, Happosai went to his room to pack for the next day. Ranma however had someone to see before he went to sleep.<p>Knocking on a door, Ranma waited a moment before the door opened to reveal his mother.<p>"Ranma dear, what is it?" asked his mother, obviously a little tired from being woken up.<p>"I'm sorry to wake ya mom, but I had to tell you that I'll be leaving with Cologne and Happosai tomorrow for a shrine where I'll be able to learn more about my heritage." said Ranma quietly.<p>"You're leaving? So soon?" said a slightly depressed Nodoka.<p>"I won't be gone forever mom. And you could come visit if you want." said Ranma, trying to cheer his mother up.<p>"I suppose I could dear, but I'd have to wait until I was sure Kasumi and Nabiki were able to take care of themselves again." said Nodoka.<p>"How are they mom?" asked Ranma.<p>Thinking a moment, Nodoka said, "Kasumi is doing a little better from earlier. However she still breaks down crying every so often. I found Nabiki crying her heart out earlier. I tried to comfort her but she half threw me out of her room."<p>Nodding sadly, Ranma said, "Try to comfort them the best you can mom. Just be careful of Nabiki. She might not like you too much cause your my mom. I think she might blame me for letting Akane die."<p>A few tears mad their way down Ranma's face before he wiped them away. Seeing her child sad, Nodoka hugged Ranma to herself for a minute before letting him go.<p>"I promise I'll be careful Ranma dear. You just be sure to see me in the morning before you go. Ok?" Nodoka said.<p>Ranma nodded. "I will mom. I'm gonna go pack then head to bed."<p>"Good Night Dear." said Nodoka.<p>"Night mom." said Ranma.<p>Both hugged one last time for the night.<p>Entering his room, Ranma grabbed his backpack and packed what few possessions he owned. Once finished, he set his backpack aside before rolling out his futon and laying down. Closing his eyes, he nodded off.<p>***Dreamscape***<p>Ranma appeared looking around and wondering where he was. Taking in his surroundings, Ranma noticed he wasn't in Japan anymore. In fact, it appeared to him he was in space. Below him a blue green planet floated. Twin rings of something orbited the planet. A little voice in the back of his head told him this was Jurai.<p>So engrossed was he at looking at the planet, he failed to notice another presence appear near him. A light feminine laughter captured his attention. Looking over, he could see a beautiful teenager. She was slim and very pretty. But what he noticed most of all was her silvery blue hair and pale red eyes.<p>"Who are you?" asked Ranma.<p>Giggling, the girl said, "I'm you silly."<p>"Huh?" said a dumbfounded Ranma.<p>Sighing at herself's thick headedness, the girls sighed. "Ranma, do you remember when the Hawk and Panther joined with you?"<p>Receiving a nod, she continued, "Well remember they said they were parts of you?"<p>A light going on over his head, he nodded and said, "Yeah, the hawk said it was a representation my power and heritage and the Panther was the representation of the Neko-ken."<p>"Correct Ranma. But they were not the only facets of yourself. You see, I am the representation of your past self's personality. I did not join with you earlier because at the time, joining with those two was enough." said the girl.<p>"But...but...but...Yer a girl!" stuttered Ranma, afraid of what she was about to say next.<p>"Oh? You noticed eh? Yes I am Ranma. You see, the child that you heard about from the hawk and your mother was the daughter of the Goddess. I am the memory of that girl. I wish to join with you to further complete yourself.<p>"B...b...but I'm a guy! I don't wanna be a girl!" stuttered Ranma again.<p>Sighing, the girl marched right up to him and slapped him.<p>"Hey! Whatdya do that for!" shouted Ranma.<p>"Baka! Just because I join with you doesn't mean you're gonna be a girl! Sheesh!" said the girl.<p>"Then what will happen?" asked Ranma, not as afraid as before of becoming a girl.<p>"You will receive the memories of yourself as you grew up with our mother on Jurai. As well as the memories after we left the planet and up to this point. The only side effect should be that you will become more comfortable with your female form. You'll still be male, you just won't hate your female form anymore.<p>"But..." said Ranma.<p>"No buts Ranma. You won't lose your masculinity. Instead you will gain your femininity and you will view both forms as your natural form. You will no longer have the weakness of being a man that turns into a girl. Instead you will be both male and female. Yin and Yang. Nobody will be able to exploit you again by calling you a girl." said the girl.<p>"Do I have a choice?" asked Ranma.<p>"You always have a choice." soothed the girl. "It's just if you don't choose to go through with this, then I'll be lost to the far corners of your mind. It took a lot of energy for me to come to you. I can't do it again."<p>Sighing, Ranma thought, *Well she did say I won't lose my masculinity. So I can still be a man amongst men for my mother. And I wouldn't have to worry about that weakness either. Sigh, too many people have exploited that for my tastes. I just don't know. Do I want to accept my female form? She did say that was what my past self was born as. Then there's what she said about being lost. I really don't want to hurt her. She did say she was me.*<p>Looking up at the girl, Ranma asked, "If I merge with you, I'll still be myself right? I won't want to start liking boys will I?<p>Giggling, the girl shook her head, "No, you will still be you. The only change will be that you will have memories from your former life and will be comfortable in your female form. And no, you don't have to like guys in that way Ranma. You will be able to make your own choices. No more, no less."<p>Sighing, Ranma said, "Fine. I'll let you merge with me. I don't want to see you get lost and besides... It's a martial artist's duty to help others."<p>Glomping on to Ranma, the girl yelled, "Yatta! You won't regret this Ranma!"<p>Muttering under his breath, "I hope not."<p>Not hearing Ranma, the girl stood back and transformed into a greenish blue sphere of energy. The sphere circled Ranma as did the hawk and panther from before. Only this time, Ranma lived through the memories as they incorporated themselves into his mind.<p>*****************<p>I remember...<p>I am newly born.<p>Opening my eyes, I focus upon the face of a beautiful woman with long silver blue hair. She is my mother. She smiles at me and says she loves me. I gurgle happily before closing my eyes.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>I remember...<p>I am 1 year old.<p>While being rocked, my mother sings a gentle lullaby to me. I could feel her warmth and love. She smiles at me. Her song soothes me and soon, I fall asleep.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>I remember...<p>I am 2 years old.<p>Taking a few steps toward my mother, I want to show her that I can walk on my own. She smiles and giggles a little at my antics. I fall and hurt my knee. She's at my side telling me I'd be alright. She kisses it and I feel better.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>I remember...<p>I am 3 years old.<p>I am in a large field of flowers running around and giggling. My mother is nearby watching me play. I find a flower like none other around. I pick it and run to my mother.<p>"Mommy! Look what I found!" I hear myself say while giving it to her.<p>"Oh it's beautiful dear. Thank You." she said while putting it in her hair.<p>I smile and hug my mother.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>I remember...<p>I am 4 years old...<p>I am with my mother. She is teaching me how to create wings of light. I try my hardest but I still can't do it. My mother tells me I'll get it eventually. I smile and nod to my mother before trying again. This time I'm successful. I manage to create a single wing. I can't keep it up for long. When it vanishes, my mother congratulates me. I hug her and tell her I love her. She tells me she loves me too.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>I remember...<p>I was 5 years old...<p>I was alone in my room. My mother had gone somewhere to keep me safe. I felt a presence in my room. It felt like my mother but it was not. I tried to cry out for my mother but I was silenced. I can feel my body losing life. Soon all was dark. I am no longer alive.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>A stray memory...<p>I don't know how old I am...<p>My mother is crying. I try to call to her but I can't. I feel her love for me and her loss. I don't understand. She takes me and sends me to the stars. I still love her and hope she can survive without me.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>A memory from a long time past...<p>I grow and learn and see many things. Much time passes. I've learnt to speak and have visited many races. I feel alone. I miss my mother.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>A more recent memory...<p>I am near a planet of blue and green. It reminds me of home. I travel there. I hear the plea of a woman. She wishes for a child. I travel to her and appear as a hawk. I feel a kinship to her but don't know why.<p>I offer to help her. She smiles and reminds me of my mother. Before we begin she asks for a boy. I am afraid, but I still wish to help. I agree and we merge. I feel her love. She is my new mother.<p>Soon I will be reborn...<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>I remember...<p>I am 6 years old...<p>A pit of cats. I am afraid. My father pushes me in again. There is much pain. Soon, I succumb to darkness. I am alone again but trapped.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>I remember a fateful day...<p>A flash of light and I am no longer in darkness. I can see myself's reflection in a pool. She is female and screaming. I am confused. As time passes I begin remerging with myself but something stops me fully. The cats still hold me prisoner. I can only wait and hope to be freed.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>A new but sad memory...<p>A mighty battle rages. We are almost defeated. Myself searches for more power. Suddenly the prison is gone. I am free once more. I impart my power and knowledge of my power unto myself. We merge further.<p>I cannot save my love. I am sad and angry.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>A memory from a few minutes ago...<p>I appear to myself and offer them full remergance. He is hesitant and I understand. He agrees and I am happy. We merge.<p>The memory faded away...<p>*****************<p>I remember now...<p>I am Ranma, child of Nodoka.<p>I am Rhea, child of Tsunami.<p>Where once were two, now are one.<p>I am Ranma and Rhea. Child of Tsunami and Nodoka.<p>I am whole.<p>*****************<p>Opening his eyes, Ranma looked around his room. It was still dark out and he was alone in the room. Sitting up, he searched his mind. She was right he realized. He no longer cared what form he was in. Both were now his natural form. He smiled and laid back down. Tomorrow he would visit someone who could tell him more about his heritage. And then, maybe, he'd be able to search for his other mother.<p>Before falling asleep, a name was whispered from his lips, "Tsunami"<p>*****************<p>At a shrine in the country, a young girl slept. On her face a smile could be seen. As she snuggled up to a furry little cabbit, a name could be heard whispered from her lips, "Rhea"<p>*****************<p>As two beings slept, dreaming of the other, a darkness stirred in the far reaches of space where it had been sleeping for millennia.<p>It could barely feel a familiar power it thought destroyed long ago. The little Hawk was somehow still alive. It's mistress would not be pleased. It began to gather it's energy to set out for the place where it sensed the energy. Soon it would be ready to leave. And then, the little Hawk would finally fall.<p>*****************<p>In a higher dimension, a being watched events transpire. It smiled to itself. Soon what it set out to do long ago would be complete. For now, it would let it's nephew/niece have their fun.<p>*****************<p>In space, on a direct course for earth, was the Jurian flagship, Kirito. Onboard, Azusa, Emperor of Jurai, watched the stars as they flew by.<p>*Soon I will be back on Earth. Something has happened and I'm sure that it involves Yosho or that boy, Tenchi. Why else would every spacetree light up and sing. It was quite beautiful. But I want answers. Besides, Funaho and Misaki will be glad to see the children again.* thought the emperor as he sat on his throne.<p>Soon he would be back on earth... Yes, soon he would have his answers.<p>*****************<p>To Be Continued...<p>Author's notes:<p>Ranma is now whole but what will await him at the Masaki shrine? How will the girls react to Happi? How will Happi react to all the pretty girls? Uh Oh! What will happen when Happi meets up with Misaki again? More secrets will be revealed. Questions will be answered. Chaos will ensue! In the next chapter of Child of the Goddess!</p>
