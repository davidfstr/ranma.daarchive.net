</div>     ****************<br/>- Child of the Goddess! -<p>-Chapter 3-<p>By: Gekigengar3<p>Disclaimer: All characters, and such are the copyrights and property of their respective owners. I claim no ownership of any character and such in any way.<p>"" = Spoken words<br/>** = Thoughts<p>It was early evening as a group of weary martial artists trekked their way into the Nerima district of Tokyo Japan. In the lead was Ranma, his head down pondering something. Behind him were Cologne, Shampoo, Ryoga, and Mousse. And behind them walked two men. One was bald and fat while the other was thinner, seemingly from dehydration as a constant stream of water was pouring out of his eyes. They all seemed to be giving Ranma his space. If one knew what had transpired at Phoenix Mountain only a week prior, then they would know why the others were giving him room.<p>A sad Ranma pondered, *This is not going to be easy. I have no clue what I'm going to tell them. How do you tell someone that their sister is dead? With the joining I've learned that death is a part of a warrior's life but still...Oh Akane, I'm so sorry I couldn't save you. If it wasn't for the panda, then I would have had the power to! Sigh, I can only hope you find peace in the next life. Please, give me the strength to tell your sisters...*<p>As Ranma sadly pondered how he was going to break the news to the Tendo sisters, the others were each lost in their own thoughts.<p>In the mind of a sad and depressed Ryoga, *Akane is dead and I know I should be blaming Ranma for it but...I can't... It's his fault she died...Right?...* Glowing a sickly green for the first time since China, Ryoga replayed the end of the battle over in his head. Ryoga shook his head. *No, Ranma fought hard. Still, I want to know where he got that power from. If he used that earlier then Akane would still be alive.*<p>Doing his usual and twisting things around in his head, Ryoga began to blame Ranma once again. *Darn You Ranma! I'll find a way to get powerful enough to make you pay for letting Akane die!* His thoughts turning darker, Ryoga once again began to believe that everything was Ranma's Fault.<p>A few feet in front of him walked Shampoo. *Aiya. Airen so strong now! Must show him who wife really is. Not dead Kitchen Destroyer or Spatula Girl. Too bad Kitchen destroyer die. She might have been my friend but that no stop me from catching airen.* shedding a single tear for Akane, Shampoo's thoughts degraded into ways of showing Ranma how much she loved him and ways to forget about the destroyer of kitchens.<p>Next to her trudged Mousse, *Saotome's power was amazing. I've never seen anything like it before. And judging from the look on the elder's face, neither had she. I wonder if he could teach me if I asked him. I know now he's not after Shampoo. He said that Saffron killed the one he loves. He had already made his decision. That does it. From this day on I'm going to try to be Ranma Saotome's friend. I think he'll need it in the time to come. I can see he's been holding back his emotions about Akane's death. I only hope he'll open up soon and begin moving on.* A few tears make their way down his face as he says a small prayer for Akane.<p>Behind the entire group walked Soun and Genma. One was a literal Niagara Falls while the other did his best to try to calm the walking waterfall down. One thought kept going through the leaky water tower's mind...*My baby girl is gone...Whaaaaaa!*<p>Genma on the other hand thought, *I wish Soun would shut up. I'm surprised I haven't turned into a Panda yet. Sigh, the schools will never be joined now. I'm fairly certain that Nabiki and Kasumi will be a mess when they learn of what happened to Akane. It's a shame what happened to her, but on the plus side, if I could get Ranma to teach me those moves he used, then I could easily be set for life! I could steal all I wanted and the police wouldn't be able to touch me! Now, how to get the boy to teach them to me.* His thoughts falling further into ways he could con his son.<p>Closer to Ranma than anyone else was Cologne. Hopping along on her walking stick, she mused to herself of what she had to do, *Son-In-...No, Ranma has grown powerful. He will definitely be an asset to the tribe. The first thing I'll have to do is talk to him alone and tell him that both the Kiss of Death and Kiss of Marriage have been nullified. After that I'll offer him membership in the tribe. Even if I have to offer him a position as an elder, I will have him in the tribe! Perhaps I'll wait on that though until I've had an opportunity to earn his trust and perhaps learn more of how he came to possess this power. I will have to converse with Yosho on this. Perhaps it's time I paid him a visit.* Smiling to herself she thought back to when she first met the man that had defeated her over two and a half centuries ago...<p>***Flashback***<p>It was a beautiful spring day around the Amazon village. The snow was gone and the sounds of marriage battles were in the air. Outside the village, a 24 year old Cologne walked around admiring the beauty of nature while on the lookout for Musk invaders. It had been a month since Happi had broken her heart and she was feeling just a little bit lonely.<p>She was cut short in her musings as some movement caught her eye. Thinking it Musk, she turned toward the source of the movement. There she spotted a man walking nearby. She couldn't tell where he was from, but his clothes resembled robes of some sort. His long black hair shone in the sun. He carried a sword with him and walked with a grace that just screamed warrior. She licked her lips as the thought of battle came to mind. He definitely wasn't Musk.<p>*Perhaps this outsider could provide a worthy challenge. And if I lost, well, he is cute.* thought the young Cologne.<p>The man also noticed movement out of the corner of his eye and turned to see Cologne looking at him. She had long purple hair and a figure that would drive any normal man wild with lust. However he was anything but normal. Just as he was about to say hello, she pulled a sword out of the scabbard on her back and charged him.<p>Reacting with centuries born of practice, he unsheathed his sword and the sound of steel meeting steel filled the air. Blow after blow were exchanged as the two fought with a tenacious ferocity. At first, it appeared as though the two were evenly matched. However this was not the case and the man made sure the woman knew it.<p>"Why are you attacking me?" he half yelled in Chinese.<p>Responding to the male she was locked in battle with, Cologne yelled, "You are trespassing outsider! This is Amazon territory!"<p>The man shook his head at fool hardy amazons and decided to end this before one of them got hurt. He'd worry about explanations later. Deciding to use a tactic he'd learnt long ago, he proceeded to criticize her skills to get her too angry to fight straight.<p>Ducking a sword swing, he said, "You're about a hundred years too young to defeat me!"<p>Enraged at the impertinence of this male in front of her, Cologne roared in fury and charged. So enraged was she that she failed to see the slight smirk that crept up on the man's face. Just as she was about to swing, he disappeared from in front of her. Stopping and looking around for the man, she suddenly felt something impact the base of her skull. With a large amount of pain, she crumpled to the ground. Her tumbling hair hiding a small smile.<p>*Finally, a worthy...Ai...Ren...* thought Cologne just before she surrendered to unconsciousness.<p>Resheathing his sword, the man shook his head. *She's young, but fairly good with that sword. Hrm, I suppose I should take her to the Amazon Village with me. I don't want to leave her out here alone.*<p>Looking around he could see the smoke of cooking fires nearby. Nodding to himself he leaned over and picked the woman and her sword up. Making sure she was comfortable, he started toward the Amazon village.<p>It took some time, but before long he arrived at the village. Two sentries watched as a male outsider walked toward the village carrying an unconscious Cologne. They both recognized her as she was the current village champion. Taking a step forward, they pointed their spears at the strange outsider.<p>"Halt! Who are you and what are you doing with her?" the both said at the same time.<p>The man, blinking at the dual voices a moment, spoke in Mandarin, "I was walking along when we met about a half a mile from here. She drew her sword and charged me. I defended myself and knocked her unconscious before someone got hurt. I wanted to bring her home so that nothing bad would happen to her."<p>The two sentries lowered their spears and smiled. It was a smile the man didn't like. It reminded him of the look of a predator when it spotted it's prey or in this case, when warrior women spotted a powerful male outsider. Well, they'd learn soon enough, along with the bundle in his arms.<p>One of the sentries motioned him to follow them into the village. He nodded and readjusted the bundle in his arms before following. As he walked through the village, many of the villagers watched as the he carried their champion into the village. They could tell by the way she was draped in his arms that she was unconscious. Then they noticed what the man looked like and one thought ran through all their minds...*What a Hunk!*<p>Meanwhile a purple haired bundle was slowly waking up. The first thing she noticed, once her brain started working again, was that she was moving. The second was that she was being carried. Cracking an eye open she realized that her first two thoughts were correct. Thinking back to earlier, a smile crept on her face. Before the man knew what happened, a purple haired bundle was wrapped around his neck and a tongue was invading his mouth. A full minute passed before she disengaged.<p>"Wo Ai Ni Airen." she said as she gazed into his eyes.<p>Nearby, several elders watched as one of their warriors made a fool of herself. Only they knew who the man was and what he did in the past. Looking at each other, they all nodded to one another. Hopping forward, they did something that none of the warriors around them had ever seen before. They bowed to a male.<p>"Greetings Honored Yosho." the Matriarch said as she rose from her bow.<p>All activity around them stopped in an instant as the warriors heard the elders call this man a name that was only spoken of in stories. The one that saved the amazon village from the Musk 200 years prior. The young Cologne looked back and forth between the man and the elders as she feared she just embarrassed herself by kissing a legend of the tribe. Her questioning look to the elders earned her a smile and a several small nods. Her fears confirmed, she did the only thing she could do. She fainted.<p>***End Flashback***<p>*I'm glad he stayed around for a few months after that. Despite being male he was considered an equal to any of the elders in status. It was a shame I couldn't have him as my husband due to him being an adopted amazon. Oh well. At least I was able to keep in contact with him over the years. I also owe him for saving my life when I turned 30. I was nearly killed in that Musk attack and if it wasn't for that water he had with him, I would have died. Hmm...Last I heard his son in law and his grandson were staying with him after his daughter died. It'll be good to talk to him again. Ranma reminded me so much of him.* silently mused Cologne.<p>Looking up ahead at Ranma, she knew what he was thinking. She could see the tears that he was attempting to hold back. Deciding to try and help, she hopped up next to him. Out of earshot of the others, she spoke.<p>"It's difficult isn't it? Trying to figure out how to tell someone a loved one is gone." she said.<p>Looking over at Cologne, Ranma nodded, "Yeah. I don't know what to do. How do you tell someone that their sister is dead?"<p>"It's never easy Son-In-...I mean Ranma. I've lived for almost three centuries and it never gets any easier having to tell someone that kind of news."<p>Shaking his head a moment, Ranma asked, "Why'd ya call me Ranma? It's always been Son-In-Law before."<p>Quietly chuckling to herself, Cologne explained, "I've decided to nullify the Kiss of Death and Kiss of Marriage. I know after what happened in China that Shampoo didn't have a chance to woo you anymore. And I thought you might like a friend in the times ahead."<p>Blinking a moment and brushing away a tear, Ranma slowly nodded his head, "Thank You...Um...Honored Elder..."<p>The use of a term of respect coming from Ranma almost caused her to lose her balance on her staff. Recovering quickly, Cologne simply chuckled...<p>"Ranma, I want you to do something for me. After you get done with the Tendo's, come and see me. I wish to discuss what happened to you in China. I believe I might be able help you. Not only in your new power but in the loss of your love." Cologne told Ranma.<p>"Um...Alright, but how can you help me with my new power? And you better not be trying to set me up again with someone. I don't want that right now. I've already avenged Akane and and begun to move on. But I still have my own bit of grieving to do." Ranma said while thinking of how she could help him with something not of this world and hoping she wouldn't try to set him up.<p>"Don't worry about that now. And no, I'm not trying to set you up with anyone. I know you will come through this on your own but I just want to help. I'll tell you about the other when you come to see me though. For now, just think of what you are going to tell Kasumi and Nabiki. Kasumi I believe will forgive you for not being able to save Akane. Nabiki however may be another story." stated Cologne.<p>Nodding, Ranma said, "I was thinking the same thing. Kasumi cares about everyone. Nabiki only cares about her family and will hurt anyone that harms someone she cares about."<p>"Indeed" said Cologne.<p>Their conversation ended for the time being, they along with the others made their way along. Soon they all came to a crossroads. It was there that Cologne, Mousse, and Shampoo parted from the group and went to the Nekohanten. Ranma, Genma, Soun, and Ryoga continued toward the Tendo Dojo. About a block away from the dojo, Ryoga's direction sense decided to take an active role again. Looking around himself, a glowing Ryoga saw a Jungle.<p>"Where am I now! Ranma, this is all your fault!" yelled Ryoga. A few birds flew away at the unexpected noise.<p>Meanwhile, back in Japan. Ranma, Genma, and Soun stood outside the gates to the Tendo Dojo. Steeling his resolve and masking his pain, Ranma entered the compound with the two adults behind him. Approaching the door, Ranma prepared himself to whatever may happen inside.<p>*******************<p>Inside the Tendo house, three women sat around the dining table sipping tea and discussing various things. The first was Kasumi. The second Nabiki. And the third was Nodoka.<p>"This is excellent tea Kasumi-chan." complimented Nodoka.<p>"She's right oneechan" quipped Nabiki.<p>"Why thank you Auntie. And you too Nabiki. That means very much to me." a blushing Kasumi said.<p>Before any more words could be exchanged, the sound of the front gates opening drew Kasumi's attention. Excusing herself, Kasumi went to the door to see who it was. Opening the door, she was greeted to the sight of Ranma, her father doing a good impression of a lawn sprinkler, and uncle Saotome.<p>"Oh Ranma-kun! Welcome back." greeted Kasumi.<p>Looking up from his pondering, Ranma saw Kasumi greet him. Replying in kind, "Hello Kasumi. It's good to be back."<p>Looking around, Kasumi asked the hundred yen question, "Ranma, where's Akane?"<p>Sighing, Ranma decided to delay this until everyone that needed to hear it was there. "Let's go inside and find Nabiki. I'll tell both of you then."<p>Slowly nodding at his guarded answer and with a tinge of worry, Kasumi said, "Nabiki is inside at the dining table with Auntie."<p>Nodding, Ranma proceeded into the household. Before following Ranma in, Kasumi looked around for her father and uncle Saotome. All that met her site was an empty walkway. It appeared that both had disappeared to parts unknown. Shaking her head and assuming they went to a bar, she followed Ranma into the living room.<p>Looking up at the entranceway, Nabiki and Nodoka saw Ranma enter. He appeared a little nervous and his eyes were slightly red. Nabiki narrowed her eyes. Something was up and she wanted to know what.<p>Behind Ranma came Kasumi. Both took a seat at the dining table and when nobody else came in, Nabiki questioned Ranma, "Welcome back Ranma. So, where's Akane?"<p>Nodoka took this opportunity to speak as well, "Yes dear, where is Akane-chan. The girls said you went to China to rescue her."<p>Sighing as the time he had dreaded was here, Ranma said the words he really didn't want to have to say. His tone was sad and subdued. "Akane's gone to meet your mother. I'm sorry."<p>Everyone blinked at Ranma's words a moment before the impact of the words hit them. Kasumi's face lost all color as her teacup slid from limp fingers and fell to the floor where it shattered.<p>"Akane's gone to be with Mother?" she emotionally asked while her lower lip was quivering. Finally, tears began to fall as she did a remarkable impression of her father.<p>Hanging his head, he simply nodded. He felt really guilty for making Kasumi sad. With his head down, he didn't see his mother move over to comfort Kasumi as she mourned for her lost sister. A few tears could be seen making their way down Nodoka's face as well.<p>Nabiki on the other hand was trying her hardest to maintain a somewhat level head. However this bombshell was wreaking havoc on her emotional defenses. A few tears squeezed their way out and began their journey down her face. She moved over to offer Kasumi a little comfort as well. She was unused to this sort of thing but she would try her hardest to help her family. Giving Kasumi a much needed supportive hug, Nabiki looked back over at Ranma and thought of what to say. She was angry, but she didn't know who to be angry at just yet.<p>With both Nodoka and Nabiki comforting Kasumi, she slowly regained control of her faculties. Her bawling had come down to a minor trickle and a lot of sniffling with the occasional relapse of bawling. At one point, she was just about to ask Ranma something when Nabiki beat her too it.<p>With her voice on the verge of breaking with emotion, Nabiki asked Ranma, "How did it happen Saotome."<p>Ranma looked back up and at each of the three women. Kasumi was still crying but it no longer threatened to flood the place. His mother looked sad as well but was holding back to offer support for the two sisters. Nabiki looked to be fighting to keep her emotions in check as well. He sighed, sniffling a little, and knew this would be difficult but he had to do it. And so he began to tell the story of what happened at Jusendo.<p>***Two Hours Later***<p>The girls had calmed down very slightly while listening to Ranma's story of Jusendo. Ranma had wisely decided to keep the part of the hawk and panther from them by just telling them he improvised a new technique on the spot which was able to defeat the phoenix king. There was no telling what would have happened if he told them he had conversed with a talking hawk and the manifestation of the neko-ken.<p>After the story had been finished, Ranma let them have time to absorb it all. Each of the three women had different thoughts running through their head.<p>A sad Nodoka thought, *My son is truly a Man amongst Men. To care so much about someone that he'd kill for them. My little boy has become a man! Now if only he'd give me some Grandchildren.* Nodoka was very sad at Akane's passing, but the thought of Grandchildren cheered her up a little bit.<p>An emotional Kasumi, thought, *Akane's gone. Just like mother. Ranma tried to save her but that bad man killed her. Normally I don't like killing, but he deserved what Ranma did to him! Poor Ranma-kun. He really did care for her. Oh Akane! I'm so sorry! If I didn't push Ranma onto you then this wouldn't have happened! Please forgive me and find peace Imouto-chan.* Kasumi began crying again.<p>Nabiki, still trying to hold onto herself emotionally, worked the story over in her mind. Something wasn't adding up here. Ranma, a simple yet powerful martial artist just goes and kills a self proclaimed God. That didn't make sense. Even if Ranma was extremely angry, he wouldn't have had the power to kill something like that. Unless...Of course! He had the power all along and didn't want to use it. He never cared for Akane and was being his usual cocky self. Oh, he was going to get it now. She'd make sure of that. She knew now who to be angry at.<p>As Nabiki worked the ole Tendo magic for coming to wrong conclusions, Ranma looked over at his Mother. "Mom? Could I talk to you alone for a minute?"<p>Making sure Kasumi and Nabiki were going to be ok, Nodoka nodded and motioned him toward the Dojo. Consenting, he lead the way. Neither noticed the predatory yet emotional sad smirk on Nabiki's face. Once in the Dojo, he gestured for her to be quiet. Reaching out with his power, he overloaded any microphones and other electronic surveillance equipment in the area. Small puffs of smoke wafted up from various places around the dojo.<p>Seeing his mother had a confused look on her face, Ranma said, "I don't want Nabiki listening in."<p>Nodoka simply nodded.<p>Trembling a little bit, Ranma did something he'd been holding back since China. He grabbed his mother in a hug and cried. Cried for his lost love. He didn't care right then if it was manly or not. He just had to vent his pent up emotions at the loss of his fiancee.<p>Nodoka, startled by the sudden surge of emotion coming from her son, hugged Ranma to herself and let him cry. To her, it was all right for a man to cry when a loved one died. It just showed how much they cared.<p>Feeling his mother embrace him back, Ranma clung harder and started sobbing, "Oh mom. I couldn't save her! I tried! Really I tried! But it wasn't enough! She still died! If only I had been faster! If only I had been stronger! If only I took Saffron more seriously! Then she'd still be alive! It's all my fault she's gone!"<p>Rocking her child, Nodoka tried to ease his pain. "Shhh...It's all right Ranma. Let it all out. I know this is hard for you. You've never had to deal with a loved one dying before."<p>Ranma's sobbing died down a little as he took comfort in his mother's arms and voice. He was like a lost child and his mother would always make him feel better. He listened as she continued to comfort him.<p>"It's not your fault Ranma dear. You did the best you could do to try and save her. At the very least, you were able to save the others. Besides, if it's anyone's fault, it's that person that killed her. You fought hard to save someone you cared about and that's all anyone could ask you to do. Don't tear yourself up over something that you had no control over. Just honor her memory and live your life to it's fullest. I'm sure Akane would have wanted you to be happy and not grieve over her forever." soothed Nodoka.<p>Ranma took great comfort in his mother's words.<p>"Besides, I still want some grandchildren." added Nodoka to help lighten the mood a little.<p>Picking up on his mother's attempt to make him feel better, Ranma chuckled a little emotionally. Hugging her tightly, he smiled at her. "Thank you mom. That means a lot to me."<p>Smiling at her child, Nodoka asked, "So are you feeling better?"<p>Ranma nodded, "Yes. I feel a little better. I just hope you don't think my breaking down like that was unmanly."<p>"Ranma dear, anyone would be heartbroken after something like this. And it's ok to cry over the loss of a loved one. Besides, I just want to see you happy."<p>Hugging his mother again, Ranma wiped away a few stray tears. Sitting across from his mother again, he smiled at her. "Thank you mom. You're right. I tried my best at the time to save her. But in the end it was Saffron's fault for killing her. But there is another to blame as well."<p>Receiving a confused look, Nodoka asked, "Who?"<p>"I'll tell you in a minute mom. But first I want to ask you something else." answered Ranma while wiping away a last tear or two.<p>She nodded as they both sat facing one another. A few moments passed in silence as Ranma prepared for what he had to ask. Accessing an old memory from the joining, Ranma held his hand palm up and concentrated. A blue ball of energy flickered into existence. Inside the ball a majestic hawk soared.<p>"Mom, do you know what this is?" he asked indicating the hawk.<p>Nodoka's face lost a little color. She knew what it was and it was something she thought she'd never see again. "Ranma dear, how?"<p>"So you do recognize it?" he affirmed while extinguishing the ball.<p>She nodded. "Yes I do. I saw the same thing about 9 months before you were born."<p>"Tell me about it." he asked gently.<p>"Well son, as I said it was roughly 9 months before you were born. Genma and I had been trying to have a child for some time but with no success. It had even gotten to the point where we went to see a doctor. We were both tested and it turned out that Genma was unable to father children due to something that had happened to him while he was training under Happosai. Genma refused to believe there was a problem with him and went to the bar with Soun." she said.<p>"Go on." said Ranma.<p>Nodding, she continued, "That night I prayed to the Kami for a child. Just as I was finishing with my prayer, a bright blue light filled the room. It was nearly blinding but it soon faded away. I looked to where it originated from and there sat a beautiful hawk. The same that was in the ball of light you just showed me."<p>Nodding, Ranma encouraged her to continue.<p>"I watched the hawk as it looked at me. We sat like that for a minute or so. Just before I was about to get up to open a window for it to leave, it spoke. It said it heard my prayer and wished to help me. Naturally I was somewhat startled but I believed it to be a messenger from the Kami. So I asked it how it was going to help me. It proceeded to tell me a story of a Goddess that had a child and of a darkness that killed the child. Of a weeping mother and what she did to ensure a part of her child survived. It told me that it was the essence of that child and it had been alone and traveling the galaxy for thousands of years. That since it was a part of the Goddess, it retained it's consciousness even after it's physical body was killed. My heart went out to it and I agreed to what it wanted to do." she continued.<p>"So the hawk was in reality the essence or soul of a child that had died thousands of years ago? What did it want to do Mom?" asked Ranma.<p>"Yes, you could say that would be an accurate description of what it was. Anyway, It wanted to give me a child by bringing life to my womb. It said that the child would be strong and powerful. I thought that would be wonderful but I wanted to ask the hawk one thing before it proceeded. I asked the hawk if it could choose the gender of the child. It nodded and I asked for a boy since Genma wanted one so. The hawk seemed to think about that for a moment. I don't know why though. Finally we both were ready and I told the hawk to begin. It transformed into a ball of energy and entered my womb. My whole body felt like it was full of energy before it settled and I could feel you in my womb. Nine months later you were born. It was one of the happiest days of my life." finished Nodoka.<p>With his mother finished, Ranma analyzed the story in his head. What she had said was basically what the hawk had told him. Genma wasn't his father and that the woman sitting in front of him was one of two mothers to him. He just wondered where the other one was. His thought processes halted a moment as he absorbed something from her story, *Wait a minute! She just said that the hawk was the essence of a child of a Goddess? Great! Not only do I not have a father, but one of my mother's is a Goddess no less. Will my life get any weirder.*<p>*******************<p>In a small house in the country, several powerful beings sneezed at the same time.<p>*******************<p>Meanwhile, back at the Tendo household. Nabiki was determined to make Ranma pay for letting her little sister get killed. Tears flowed down her face, but she didn't have time to grieve since she was so angry at Ranma. In her room she pulled out a hidden set of headphones so that she could listen into what Ranma and his Mother were talking about. Flipping a switch to activate the feed, all she heard was static. *Arg, why doesn't this thing work? I paid a lot of yen for that equipment. Ooh, that store is going to get a call from me in the morning.* thought Nabiki before she finally succumbed to her emotions. Her mask cracked and she cried. She cried harder than she ever had since her mother's death. *Oh Akane! I'll make Ranma pay for letting you get killed! I promise!*<p>*******************<p>In the Dojo, Ranma noticed his mother was beginning to cry a little. Whether it was from the bombshell he dropped earlier or her recalling the story of his birth, he wasn't sure. But being the kind son he was, he moved over and gave his mother a hug.<p>Nodoka looked down to see her boy awkwardly giving her a hug. She smiled while vowing that Genma would get what was coming to him for not nurturing her boy's emotional side.<p>The moment between Mother and Son was short lived as a cry of "SWEETO!" broke them out of their moment. Both looked up just in time to see a large amount of water heading directly for them with a small gnome behind it. Seeing his mother about to get wet, Ranma pushed her out of the way just before the water hit him. Feeling the usual change occur, Ranma tried to stop the old pervert but was unable to.<p>Locked onto his favorite bosom, Happosai began to replenish his ki reserves. Well, at least that was what he was trying to do. Something felt different about the boy's aura. He was unable to draw upon it like usual. Probing, Happosai was nearly knocked back. *The boy's aura has changed! It's Jurian energy! But how?*<p>Happosai disengaged just before an elbow strike could connect with his head. He stood back and looked at Ranma. That was when he saw something that shouldn't be. Nodoka noticed it as well once she regained her bearings. Both were looking at Ranma oddly and he wondered what they were staring at.<p>"What?" asked a confused Ranma.<p>"Ranma dear, your hair. And your eyes..." Nodoka said. Her voice hinted with a little worry.<p>Worried about something, Ranma rushed out of the dojo and to the upstairs bathroom. Forgetting about Nabiki's surveillance equipment, Ranma looked into the mirror. He just stared at his hair and eyes. *My Hair! My Eyes! They've...changed...*<p>Indeed they had changed. Her hair was no longer the vibrant red it was before. Now it was of two colors. Some still the vibrant red, but the rest was a silver blue. Normally that would look odd but to her the two looked good on her. But what was equally odd were the eyes. Where once a crystal blue existed now exhibited another color. A pale red. Her eyes had pale red in them. They blended into the crystal blue and made her look a little more exotic.<p>Shaking her head, she went over to the furo and splashed herself with some warm water. The change took place and she, now a he went over to the mirror to check his appearance. His appearance was mostly the same. But the eye colors remained. Shaking his head, he thought, *Great. Now those physical changes are beginning. Sigh. I wonder what will happen next.*<p>Meanwhile back in the Dojo, Happi sat and smoked his pipe. Despite there being a woman in the room, he showed remarkable restraint. But then again, something had occurred that made him have to think about things. *So, Ranma is Jurian. Or at least part Jurian. I never thought I'd live to see the day when another Jurian would appear on this planet. But I wonder how. Genma certainly isn't. And Nodoka...hrm...I know I did a passing probe of her before and her energy was human. Hmm, let's probe a little deeper this time.*<p>Closing his eyes, Happosai stretched his senses to probe Nodoka. *Her energy is human all right. But deeper down there seem to be some tell tale traces of Jurian there and something else. I'm not sure what though. It's similar to the Juraian energy.*<p>With his eyes still closed after probing Nodoka, Happi thought back to his younger days. He remembered when he was the head combat instructor for the palace guards on Jurai. He was only 22 at the time but his ability to battle with either sword or hand to hand was very impressive. So much so that the Emperor appointed him to teach his guards the art of the sword and a little hand to hand as well. Of course he could no longer use a sword due to his extreme age and shortness. Besides, he didn't want to kill anyone.<p>Even back then, he still had his love of women and silky darlings. *How was I to know that Misaki would get angry about me adding some of her panties to my collection. Ah, the crown of my collection. Hmm, I believe I still have a pair of them somewhere. Sigh, they just had to go and banish me from Jurai. Didn't help either that they stripped me of my ability to generate or use Jurian energy. They probably think I'm dead. Well, at least they didn't know about those techniques I had just developed for draining the life energy of other beings to sustain myself and grow stronger without the water of life. Too bad it wouldn't work on Jurian energy.*<p>The sound of Ranma returning broke Happosai out of his musings. He noticed the now male Ranma had the same thing happen to his eyes as was evident in his female form. *Something's happening to the boy. This I'm certain. But what, I don't know. I think I'll have a talk with Cologne-chan about it since she was there at whatever caused this.*<p>Looking at his Mother, "Mom"<p>Then looking over at Happosai, "Letch"<p>"What happened Ranma?" asked his mother. Things just kept popping out of the woodwork tonight and she was afraid what else would happen.<p>Looking at Happosai a moment, Ranma decided whether or not to tell his mother with the old pervert there.<p>"Don't worry Ranma. I already know some of what is going on. However I think it would be best if you come and talk to Cologne and I later on." Happi said with a seriousness not seen before.<p>Blinking a moment, Ranma nodded.<p>As Happi bounced away, Ranma told his mother about the part he left out of the story earlier. Nodoka was quite shocked to learn that the hawk spoke to Ranma. She was also concerned about the physical changes that were going to happen to her son. However Ranma assured her that they wouldn't be too major. Just that they would show his heritage from both the hawk and the panther. When Ranma finished, Nodoka had one question.<p>"Ranma dear?" she asked.<p>"Yes Mom?" replied Ranma.<p>"You said a panther, that was the representation of something called the Neko-ken, talked to you. What is the Neko-ken?" queried Nodoka.<p>Sighing, Ranma proceeded to tell his mother what being on the road with his father was really like. Including what the Neko-ken was and how it was taught. Also what the effect of it had on the hawk. He told her that if he hadn't been trained in that technique, then he would have been able to save Akane easily.<p>To say she was pissed when he finished was an understatement. For a brief moment, he thought he saw something glowing on her forehead but it was gone before he could figure out if it was there or not.<p>With an icy calm, Nodoka spoke, "Ranma, based on what you've told me and I don't believe you'd lie to me..."<p>Shaking his head he urged her on to tell him whatever she was going to say.<p>"Then I have no recourse but to leave your father...No, I mean to leave that miserable excuse of a man." she stated.<p>Nodding, Ranma agreed. "Yes, but hold off on telling him until I'm ready. I plan to pay him back for all he's put me through over the years. Including his part in the events that led to Akane's death."<p>Agreeing, Nodoka hugged her son. "Ranma dear, what will we do about the girls. Soun won't be able to care for them. No doubt he hasn't stopped crying since you left China."<p>"I agree mom. I think you should move in here for a little while to help them get through this. Especially Kasumi." said Ranma while hugging his mother back.<p>"What about Nabiki?" asked Nodoka.<p>"Nabiki...Nabiki I don't trust right now. She didn't seem as broken up about this as she should have been. I think she might blame me for letting Akane get killed even though I did everything I could to save her. Just be careful mom. There's no telling what she might do." said Ranma while hugging his mother back.<p>"I noticed that as well earlier. And yes, I will be careful. Now then son, what are you going to do now?" inquired Nodoka.<p>Moving back from the hug, Ranma stood and looked at his mother. "I'm going to go talk to Cologne and Happosai before I go to train so that I can fully control my power and abilities. But it all depends on what happens after I meet with them."<p>Nodding, Nodoka stood and embraced her son again. "Then be well my son. No matter what it was that brought you into this world, I will always love you."<p>Hugging his mother back, Ranma nodded with a few tears in his eye. Once the hug ended, Ranma went outside and waved goodbye to his mother before taking to the rooftops in the direction of the Nekohanten.<p>Turning, Nodoka went back inside to help comfort the girls. However, a stray thought stopped her in her tracks. *Oh dear. I almost forgot that the hawk was a female. Then that must mean...*<p>In a Kasumi like fashion, she uttered, "Oh My!"<p>*******************<p>Meanwhile, at a small shrine in the country, a phone was ringing. Answering the phone, the priest of the shrine said, "Moshi Moshi. Masaki Shrine."<p>Author's Notes:<p>More is revealed in the story of how Cologne knows Yosho. But what about Happi? What will this mean for Ranma as he heads toward revelations about himself. And who is calling the Masaki Shrine at this time of night? What does Nabiki have up her sleeve and will it involve Ryoga or Shampoo? All this and more in the next chapter of Child of the Goddess!<p>To Be Continued...</p>
