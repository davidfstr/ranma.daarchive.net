</div><br/>Family Trees<p>Ripples in the Water<p>Same Warning and Disclaimer: I don't own any of this<br/>stuff...and don't take this fic too seriously.<p>Last Episode: Wu Fei is set off on a rant about<br/>marriage by the mention of the word "amazon." The<br/>Nerimites meet Tenchi, his grandfather, Ryoko and<br/>Ayeka. Nabiki notices something. Xellos feels<br/>someone walk over his grave. The Masaki crew are<br/>given the short version of fiancee situation. The<br/>Mano cousins discuss a traitor branch of the family.<p>"Yes, its a spatula why do you ask?" Leaf said, her<br/>husband still busy trying to extricate himself from<br/>her spell. A blue aura began to grow around the boy,<br/>and she stepped back ready to repell a spell. She was<br/>surprised when the boy took his umbrealla off his pack<br/>and stuffed the point in her husband's face.<br/>"Then you're Ukyou's parents?" Ryouga asked,<br/>seemingly calm, looking down at the tentacles wrapping<br/>around the man's feet.<br/>"You know Ukyou?" Leaf shouted eagerly, ignoring<br/>the obviously threatening position the boy was<br/>directing her husband. After all he was a kid,<br/>whatever he could do was nothing more than what Jiro<br/>deserved. "Where can we find her?"<br/>"So he's the one made her pretend to be a boy and<br/>chase after Ranma? You're the reason I'm constantly<br/>getting clobbered over the head with a giant spatula?"<br/>"Excuse me," Leaf paused and glared at her now very<br/>nervous husband. "Jiro, you made her pretend to be a<br/>boy?"<br/>"I had a reason," he swallowed.<p>"Hmm, excuse me a moment, father, Mr. Saotome,"<br/>Kasumi said as she breathed through the house to<br/>answer the door. She found a small crowd on the other<br/>side. "Oh my, I help you?"<br/>"Is Sylphiel here?" Kasumi looked down toward the<br/>red-head who was standing in front of the group. She<br/>looked to be about twenty-five years old or so.<br/>Though she had that same look in her eyes of greater<br/>age that Cologne and Happosai had. Almost all of them<br/>had that same look however, the blonde woman and<br/>purple haired man more than the others. The lone<br/>exception was the fortyish looking blonde man that was<br/>obviously with the red head.<br/>"You are here to see Sylphiel Tendo?" Kasumi said<br/>quietly.<br/>"Sylphiel TENDO?" the odd blue-skinned man toward<br/>the back repeated. "Yes, well I suppose her name<br/>would change if she got married."<br/>"Well where is she?" the red-head demanded again.<br/>"I'm sorry, but my mother has been dead for many<br/>years now."<br/>"Your mother? She's dead?" The black haired woman<br/>had been holding herself aloof up to that point, and<br/>now she suddenly looked very guilty.<br/>"I'm afraid so, would you like to come in?" Kasumi<br/>moved herself to the side and gestured for them to<br/>come in.<br/>"Certainly, thank you miss-?"<br/>"Kasumi," she answered the tall blonde woman. "If<br/>you'll excuse me I was just making dinner..." There<br/>was a blur as the red-head and the blonde man zipped<br/>past.<br/>"Lina-san," the black haired woman gasped in<br/>embarrassment.<br/>"Uh...Kasumi," her father called from the dining<br/>room. "Who are these people over here?"<br/>"Friends of mother's, father," Kasumi answered as<br/>she let them in.<br/>"OH My Late wife," Soun sniffed. "HOW I MISS YOU!<br/>WAAAAHH!"<br/>As the black-haired woman and the purple-haired man<br/>past she reached out to stop him, politely and<br/>unaggressively, but still firm. "Excuse me, are you a<br/>relative of my mother's?"<br/>"No, why do you ask?" he said, turning closed eyes<br/>toward her.<br/>"You bare a slight resemblance to my sisters,"<br/>Kasumi answered.<br/>"Surprise, sur..." the black haired woman paused<br/>and looked at the man. "SISTERS? Plural? Something<br/>I should know about, Xellos?"<br/>"Now, now, Ame-chan, now's not the time," he<br/>pointed at Kasumi.<br/>"Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't be discussing our<br/>personal matters in front of you like this," the woman<br/>bowed formally.<br/>"It is perfectly all right," Kasumi answered. "I<br/>thought I recognized him as mother's...friend anyway.<br/>I should apologize to you from questioning him here in<br/>front of you."<br/>"Perhaps I should talk to you later, Kasumi-san,"<br/>Amelia said as Xellos fake cringed past them. Amelia<br/>knew he was enjoying the meal, and it irritated her a<br/>little more. Though of course he had never seriously<br/>hurt her, well never intended to.<p>"Who won?" Akane asked as Ranma and Tenchi came<br/>into the house for dinner. She blinked as she saw a<br/>sopping wet Ranko walk in behind her fiancee's shell<br/>shocked cousin.<br/>"Does anybody have any hot water?" Ranma-chan<br/>asked.<br/>"Certainly," Sasami said, surprised but non-pulsed.<br/>She sure they'd explain where Akane-san's fiancee<br/>went in moment. She stepped up and drifted off to the<br/>kitchen happily.<br/>"Who is that girl and what's she doing with Lord<br/>Tenchi?"<br/>"Oh, Ranma, just why were you fighting near the<br/>lake?" Nodoka shook her head sadly.<br/>"Smooth move, Saotome," Nabiki noted.<br/>"I wasn't!" he snapped. "There was a mop bucket!"<br/>"Come on, girl," Ryoko stood up growling. "Who are<br/>you and what are you doing with Tenchi?"<br/>"Oh it'll be obvious in moment," Ranma started.<br/>Ryoko launched out with a fist, which Ranma blocked<br/>almost absently.<br/>"What the...?" Ryoko found she couldn't press her<br/>fist forward even an inch, and the red-head didn't<br/>seem to be having trouble at all.<br/>"Sorry, I don't fight girls," Ranma-chan said<br/>simply.<br/>Tenchi was still trying to process the recent<br/>event. He'd seen some strange things, but this had to<br/>top them. Washu leaned back and arched an eyebrow<br/>with curiosity and amusement.<br/>"Here's your hot water miss..." Ranma-chan took the<br/>kettle and upended over her head.<br/>"HOT!HOT!HOT!" Ranma, now a he, danced<br/>around trying to cool off. All the Masaki crew aside<br/>from Tenchi, Washu and Yosho face faulted.<br/>"How the heck did she...he...uh you do that?"<br/>"Its a curse," Akane explained as Ranma blew his<br/>hands cool. "He fell into the Jusenkyo pool of<br/>drowned girl, so when he gets what he becomes a girl."<br/>"This is...strange," Tenchi said finally. Yosho<br/>laughed, amused. He'd heard of the springs before,<br/>but he'd never thought that he'd see a victim, or that<br/>it would be his own grandson.<br/>"Uh, why is she looking at me like that?" Ranma<br/>asked pointing at Washu. The Masaki crew<br/>sweatdropped.<br/>"Hmm, THAT will make an interesting wedding night,"<br/>Nobuyuki sniped. Ranma and Akane resisted the urge to<br/>smash him into the ground. After all, they were the<br/>guests.<br/>"You get used to it," Nabiki said. "Lots of the<br/>gang back home is cursed, including one of the<br/>fiancees." Nabiki checked her watch. "Speaking of<br/>which."<br/>"Speaking of which what?" Ayeka snapped. "Speak<br/>plainly if you can!"<br/>"Patience, sister," Nabiki snickered. "Remember I<br/>when said two hours?"<br/>"Yes and why do you insist on calling me sister?<br/>And what does this have to do with anything?"<br/>"Consider it a display of female solidarity,"<br/>Nabiki said. "And as for the comment two hours, I<br/>believe I said that...abouut...two hours ago...NOW!"<p>*THUD*<p>"What was that?" Tenchi asked. Ranma and Akane<br/>looked sick.<p>*THUD*<br/>*THUD*<br/>*THUD*<br/>*CRASH*<p>The wall collapsed in a shower of dust.<p>"Nihao!"<br/>"Get away from my Ranma-darling you Gaijin hussy!"<br/>"Hey Ranchan, I'm here to save you from that<br/>heartless Nabiki!" Nabiki arched an eyebrow.<br/>"Sorry about this," Ranma moaned.<p>"You know what?" Leaf tapped her feet angrily.<br/>"This bridge looks awfully familiar."<br/>"I'm doing the best I can ALRIGHT!" Ryouga<br/>shouted.<br/>"This is the fifth time we've been here," Kuonji<br/>noted, then whistling innocently when they both glared<br/>at him.<br/>"Just let me find someone to ask directions,"<br/>Ryouga complained looking around for a sign of<br/>anything familiar. It was a futile gesture, Ryouga<br/>wouldn't recommend a structure unless it was on top of<br/>him. Suddenly Leaf's eyes widened in sudden fear.<br/>"Eveyrbody hide!" they scattered to various<br/>positions as what seemed to be a cute blonde girl<br/>skated by, humming happily to herself. ~All that evil<br/>and darkness can't be coming from that girl, can it?~<br/>Suddenly the blonde girl stopped and stared at stop<br/>sign.<br/>"OH! What a CUTE stop sign! Lisa-Maria come home<br/>with Azusa?" The cute girl ripped the sign out of the<br/>ground and happily skated back the way she came. Leaf<br/>sweatdropped.<br/>"Is she gone?" Leaf looked over to see Ryouga<br/>shaking in fear high in a leafy tree.<br/>~If I hadn't felt her I'd be calling him a wuss,~<br/>she said. ~Wow, I wonder what she is.~<br/>"What's the big deal about that girl?" her husband,<br/>Jiro, asked.<br/>"She wants to take me home and put me in her<br/>collection of cute things," Ryouga whispered. "Is she<br/>gone?"<br/>"I don't see her anywhere," Leaf said. "Now can we<br/>PLEASE get to this place and find my daughter?"<br/>"Just a moment," Ryouga said. "I see somewhere we<br/>can ask directions."<br/>"Hello," Ryouga said as the door opened. "Can you<br/>direct us to..."<br/>"Oh...hello Ryouga," Kasumi said sweetly. "Ranma's<br/>not here, he went with Akane, Nabiki and his mother to<br/>visit his family."<br/>"Well I'm not here to...WHAT...Akane AND Nabiki?<br/>Does he know no shame? RANMA SAOTOME PREPARE TO..."<br/>"Jiro, spatula." Leaf pointed at Ryouga who was<br/>preparing to leave.<br/>"Yes, maam."<br/>*clang*<br/>"HEY!"<br/>"I'd be glad to let you run off it get lost, that<br/>is AFTER you help me find my daughter."<br/>"Ukyou hits harder than him," Ryouga noted<br/>critically. Leaf blinked and started laughing<br/>hysterically.<br/>"That's not funny," Jiro Kuonji whined.<br/>"Excuse me, would you like to come in," Kasumi<br/>asked, as the "girl" started to calm down. "I was<br/>just serving dinner, and we would welcome more<br/>company."<br/>"That sounds..." Jiro was cut off by a look from<br/>his suddenly serious wife.<br/>"Sorry, but we have to go find our daughter..."<br/>"Do you mean Ukyou?" Kasumi asked. Leaf and Jiro<br/>blinked. "Well she does take after you, and that man<br/>is wielding a giant spatula."<br/>"So do you know where she is?"<br/>"She went with the other fiancees to go after<br/>Ranma," Kasumi said sweetly. "It shouldn't take you<br/>long to get there, perhaps you'd want some rest and<br/>food first?"<br/>"Hey Kasumi, what's with inviting people to<br/>dinner?" Ryouga asked, confused.<br/>"Well, okay just for a little bit," Leaf said<br/>finally.<br/>"Well it is moderately boring without Ranma<br/>around," Kasumi said quietly. "So I was hoping to<br/>make do. Mother's friends are certainly interesting,<br/>but I certainly wouldn't want to turn out such a good<br/>friend of the family as Ryouga or Ukyou's parents."<br/>"Is there enough food?" Jiro asked.<br/>"Oh, I'm used to cooking for Ranma and his father,<br/>well, step-father as it turns out," Kasumi said.<br/>"Genma is here, and two of mother's friends certainly<br/>have healthy appetites, but I think I can make do."<br/>She smiled sweetly.<br/>"Yeah, yeah," LEaf sighed as she accepted the offer<br/>and walked into the house. "Garrick always said a<br/>mercenary should be ready to eat whenever they can.<br/>That was ONE thing he was right about at least."<br/>"Hey look, Lina, its an elf!"<br/>"I'm only half-elf you dolt!" Leaf snapped.<br/>"We've become a dungeons and dragons convention<br/>Saotome," Soun noted wearily. Jiro stepped in, saw<br/>Genma and growled.<br/>"Ah...Kuonji," Genma swallowed. "Long time no<br/>see."<br/>"SAOTOME PREPARE TO DIE!" Jiro charged forward<br/>spatula upraised.<br/>"Hey you spilled my food! FIREBALL!"<br/>Kasumi smiled as the chaos continued. Now it<br/>seemed more like home again, she walked to the<br/>telephone to contact the contractors.<p>"There, finished," Kiyone said wearily, looking<br/>about the last bit of the ships quarters. It had<br/>taken long enough to do the job, but now she was done.<br/>Everything looked perfect.<br/>"Hey, Kiyone," Mihoshi called to the swiftly<br/>calming detective.<br/>"What is it Mihoshi?"<br/>"What if she tries to show up at the apartment?"<br/>Kiyone blinked. "I mean we haven't paid the rent in<br/>two months, and last time we were there the place was<br/>a wreck from the fight when everybody visited last<br/>time."<br/>"ARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!"<br/>"Hey why don't we have headquarters give her<br/>Tenchi's address and meet her there?" Kiyone fought<br/>to get a grip on herself. When MIHOSHI was thinking<br/>clearer than she was, it was a BAD sign.<br/>"That's a good idea Mihoshi, let's do that," she<br/>noticed a frame sitting on the control center. There<br/>were several individual pictures inside the glass.<br/>Mihoshi must have pulled it out while they were<br/>cleaning. She glanced at the picture of a younger<br/>Mihoshi, and her mother.<br/>Kiyone had met the woman once or twice, and<br/>remembered she had a tendency to talk about future<br/>events as if they were history. She guessed it had<br/>something to do with being FROM the future. Still Bra<br/>was almost as big a ditz as Mihoshi. Still there were<br/>some people there she didn't recognize.<br/>"Hey Mihoshi who are these other people here in<br/>these pictures?"<br/>"Well, that's my younger brother," she pointed to<br/>an angry looking boy in a black, sleeveless t-shirt.<br/>"And our younger sister." The girl she pointed to was<br/>a red-head wearing metal bracers about four years old.<br/>There was a crushed piece of pipe in her hands, and<br/>she embarrassed. Kiyone noted that Mihoshi would have<br/>been about eighteen when this picture was taken so<br/>that was maybe seven years ago.<br/>"And in this picture?" It was a young couple. One<br/>was an opportunistic looking woman with blue hair<br/>wearing a tee-shirt that said "capsule" across the<br/>front. The other had an angry expression similar to<br/>Mihoshi's brother, and wild, spiky black hair.<br/>"Oh those are my grandparents that aren't born<br/>yet," she said as if it was no big-deal. "And this<br/>guy over here is my dad." Kiyone had thought that the<br/>individual in question wasn't supposed to be there<br/>actually, since his back was turned to the camera. He<br/>seemed to be scratching his head in confusion though,<br/>and knowing Mihoshi it fit.<br/>"I can't wait to meet your family!" Mihoshi jumped<br/>up and down in delight.<br/>"Yeah, well let's make those calls, then," Kiyone<br/>sat down and turned to the communications controls.<p>Back to Family Trees
