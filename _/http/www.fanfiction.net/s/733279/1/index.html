</div>((Note: this would be about five years after the<br/>epilogue of Ryoko Saotome. The flashback parts range<br/>from about eight to ten years after episode 18.))<p>"Oh, wow," Karan said, impressed as he looked over<br/>Akane's shoulder. "That's very good."<p>"Hey," Akane said, looking down at her little<br/>doodle. "It's just a doodle."<p>"If that's doodling," the officer said. "I'd love<br/>to see a full sketch." He leaned in a little closer<br/>to the paper, hands setting on the chair so he could<br/>lean in close.<p>"Maybe later, Karan," Akane said, glancing at the<br/>hands on the chair to either side of her. The kryn<br/>was looking for some action as usual. If he didn't<br/>back off of her soon, he'd get some action of a<br/>different kind.<p>"Maybe on our next date?" he asked, smirking.<br/>Akane frowned and tapped her fingers warningly.<p>Karan was the first and last time Akane had dated<br/>within the job pool. Unlike the amiable breakup she'd<br/>had with a lot of her other boyfriends, he didn't seem<br/>able to tell that he wasn't wanted in that way. Which<br/>made him unwanted in a rather dangerous way.<p>"Karan," Akane said. "As I was told by a good<br/>friend of mine before she was a friend. Go over there<br/>and chase that mouse. Unless you want a demonstration<br/>of Anything Goes Gun Arts Pistol Whipping."<p>The kryn immediately stepped away and shrugged as<br/>if he hadn't just been scared back.<p>"I'll see you tonight, then," he said, and walked<br/>away.<p>"Perverted NEKOJIN," Akane called out. In the time<br/>since Ayeka had met with the assorted "cat races" in<br/>the galaxy, that particular word had fallen into<br/>intense disfavor. As far as they were concerned,<br/>calling them a nekojin was little better than calling<br/>them dirty little animals just a little raised from<br/>the mud.<p>Several people, almost all of the cat races, had<br/>looked up in irritation to see what had brought on the<br/>use of that word.<p>Then they looked down again and returned to their<br/>work. It was well known in the Galaxy Police office<br/>that Karan N'Jar WAS a dirty little animal just a<br/>little raised from the mud.<p>Also, anybody who could get Akane Saotome riled up<br/>enough to used such an insult deserved it.<br/>Especially since she didn't like the description any<br/>more than the rest of them did.<p>"He is right you know," a Ctarl Ctarl said, coming<br/>to step in beside Akane. "You CAN draw well, you<br/>should try to sell something sometime."<p>~If only you knew, Aisha~ Akane thought, thinking<br/>of a certain popular manga that she could see at least<br/>three people reading right now. It didn't get<br/>distributed often, as the author had another job that<br/>used a lot of time, but it was well done. "Well, it's<br/>just something to do in my free time. I wanted to be<br/>an artist when I was a kid, but I wouldn't leave this<br/>job even if I did become a successful artist."<p>"Why did you choose to become a police officer?"<br/>the Ctarl Ctarl emissary asked.<p>"That goes back to when I was a kid, too," Akane<br/>said.<p>**********<p>The kindergarten seemed perfectly normal for a few<br/>moments. Lots of kids with dark hair sitting in<br/>little desks waiting to be taught the basic<br/>fundamentals. There were only two exceptions to this<br/>normalcy.<p>The first was a rather large boy, though his face<br/>was more angular than normal, sort of like his mother.<br/>He almost looked like he belonged in the next grade,<br/>and he was quite strong for his age too. That wasn't<br/>what made him not normal, however, the not normal part<br/>came from the little fangs that showed when he yawned,<br/>spoke, or otherwise opened his mouth. At the moment<br/>he was gritting his teeth in rage.<p>The second was a rather petulant little Chinese<br/>girl with orange, not red, but orange hair. Further<br/>offsetting her from the normal was the fact that her<br/>ears came to a definite, elfin point. She was picking<br/>at her school uniform as if it were something<br/>distasteful while chatting animatedly with the little<br/>boy.<p>"My daddy is powerful," she said idly. "My daddy<br/>can beat your daddy even when my daddy is a duck.<br/>And my mommy says Ranma beat my daddy. So your daddy<br/>is not even second. My mommy could beat up your daddy.<br/>Tenchi can already leap twice his own height, my daddy<br/>is teaching me how to leap. My Daddy can fly. Maybe<br/>Tenchi's mommy will teach Tenchi how to fly? Then<br/>Tenchi will come and take me away like a prince and a<br/>princess in a story. Will your mommy teach you how fly?<br/>Can your mommy fly? Can your DADDY fly?"<p>A five year old Sano Hibiki twitched angrily as he<br/>turned, with gritted teeth to glare at Lotion. Just<br/>then a new "unusual" student walked into the class<br/>room.<p>"I bet Akane knows how to fly already," Lotion said<br/>already as the new girl walked in. Sano's eyes were<br/>locked on the girl suddenly and flaming angry.<p>Said girl had deep green hair with just the right<br/>touch of silver as to appear that her hair was spun<br/>from emeralds. She had slitted cat's eyes, as blue as<br/>the most perfect sapphire. Her black tail swished<br/>happily behind her as she came into the classroom and<br/>proceeded to wait for the teacher to show up.<p>At five years old these features made her cute as a<br/>button. Though there were more than a few parents<br/>that had commented on her future as a heartbreaker.<br/>Like her parents in many ways.<p>"Oh, hiya!" Akane said as she noticed Sano. She<br/>had seen him once or twice when 'Auntie' Ukyou and<br/>Hibiki-san came over, but the boy had never really<br/>talked to her yet. She was more familiar with the<br/>older Hibiki's really, but she guessed the boy was<br/>just shy.<p>The orange haired-girl she vaguely recognized as<br/>one of the Amazons. She didn't see the Amazons that<br/>often, sometimes it seemed that her parents didn't<br/>want their kids to play with the Amazons. She'd heard<br/>something about "waiting for proof that the outsider<br/>laws don't apply to children," but didn't know what<br/>was meant by that.<p>"Oh! Hi, Akane-san!" the orange-haired girl said,<br/>suddenly adopting a rather awe-struck demeanor. Akane<br/>blinked and froze in mid wave, still not having<br/>noticed that Sano was growling at her for some reason.<br/>"You are RANMA'S daughter, yes?"<p>"Uh huh," Akane said hesitantly, nodding in<br/>confusion.<p>"Would you be my friend?" Kimchi asked. "Are you a<br/>great warrior like your father? Or a witch like your<br/>mother?"<p>"Hey, 'Kaasan is not a witch!" Akane said angrily,<br/>her tail fluffed out and then she sat down in a huff.<br/>"And I am not a warrior. That's what my BROTHER wants<br/>to do. HE'S the one that wants to be the newest great<br/>martial artist." Lotion looked vaguely disappointed,<br/>she thought sure her Aunt Ran-Ran said that Ryoko<br/>Saotome was a witch.<p>"You introduce me to brother then?" she asked.<br/>"Maybe we'll spar!"<p>"Saotome," Sano growled. Akane blinked and looked<br/>around for her brother for a moment. Usually growled<br/>last names were directed at him by teachers or<br/>whoever. She finally blinked, confused, and looked to<br/>Sano.<p>"Are you talking to me?" Akane asked finally.<p>"Am I talking to you?" Sano repeated angrily.<p>"Well, there's no one behind me," Akane said. "So<br/>you must be talking to me."<p>"QUIT LAUGHING AT ME!" Sano shouted angrily.<br/>Akane was taken aback, no one had ever yelled her like<br/>that before.<p>"What did I do?" she asked.<p>"You KNOW!" Sano growled angrily. Akane was saved<br/>from responding as the teacher came in. Sano quietly<br/>growled for some reason that perplexed her.<p>**********<p>"So what do you want to be when you grow up?" the<br/>teacher asked Kimchi.<p>"I am a princess of the Amazon tribe," Kimchi said.<br/>"I will be matriarch when I grow up."<p>"That's nice," the teacher said, he was usually<br/>somewhat bored with the interviews, but for the moment<br/>he was very interested. Interested, but also very<br/>pained.<p>"And what would you like to be, Hibiki?" the<br/>teacher asked.<p>"I'm going to be martial artist!" Sano said.<br/>"Better than Ranma."<p>"Ano..." Akane said quietly.<p>"And you, Saotome?" the teacher asked.<p>"I want to be a drawer!" Akane declared cheerfully.<br/>There was some snickering behind her. "What's so<br/>funny, she asked."<p>"It's artist, Saotome," the teacher said.<p>"What is artist, Sensei?" Akane asked, confused,<br/>and hurt by all the laughter that accompanied the<br/>question.<p>"An artist is someone who draws," the teacher<br/>explained. "So you want to be an artist when you grow<br/>up?"<p>"No, I don't want to be an artist," Akane said.<br/>"My brother wants to be an artist."<p>"But you said you liked to draw," the teacher<br/>continued.<p>"Hai," Akane said.<p>"An artist is someone who draws," the teacher said.<br/>Akane's eyes looked confused for a moment. She<br/>recovered quickly, however.<p>"Hai," Akane said. "I want to be the best artist<br/>ever!" Unfortunately, Sano was distracted enough<br/>that the only thing he heard was the last sentence.<p>**********<p>"Go away," the girl said to Akane. "Go away!"<p>"Umm," Akane said, confused.<p>"Shew!" the girl said. "Go! Shew, go away! Go<br/>chase that mouse over there."<p>~Why won't anyone talk to me?~ Akane asked herself<br/>as her tail flicked about angrily.<p>**********<p>Akane started walking out of the school looking<br/>rather dejected. Not many of the other kids had<br/>wanted to have anything to do with her. Her tail<br/>drooped sadly as she considered that. Sano had<br/>growled at her all day and that Lotion girl had<br/>treated her like she was Sailor Moon come to life, but<br/>that was it.<p>It was like there was something about her that made<br/>the other kids want to avoid her or something. She<br/>couldn't think of why that would be so. She got along<br/>fine with most of the kids that came to visit with<br/>their parents. She just didn't understand it.<p>Suddenly her thoughts were cut off as her way<br/>forward was cut off by something.<p>"So," Sano growled. "My kaasan and tousan are<br/>weak?"<p>"I didn't say..." Akane started, nervously.<p>"Quiet Saotome!" Sano growled. "We'll see who's<br/>weak."<p>Akane desparately tried to think any of the things<br/>she had seen her parents, or even her brother,<br/>practicing as her adrenal response was triggered.<br/>Panicked, Akane tried the only technique she knew: run<br/>away. The chase was on.<p>As it was, Sano wasn't much more dangerous than<br/>most other five year olds, so the chase looked a lot<br/>like two little kids chasing each other around an<br/>empty playground. Which is exactly what it was.<p>"Quit bouncing around and come back here!" Sano<br/>shouted as his quarry panickly moved through and under<br/>the playscape.<p>"Leave me alone!" Akane shouted. "Tenchi fights,<br/>not me!" Akane failed to note where she was heading<br/>in her panic and ran into one of the steel bars that<br/>made up the jungle gym, just as she was turning to<br/>face it. She covered her face with her hands and<br/>proceeded to bawl her eyes out.<p>"Now I got you, Saotome," Sano growled, smirking.<p>"Hey! Sis!" a voice said. "Are you okay? What<br/>happened?" Tenchi Saotome, black and silver hair tied<br/>back in a pigtail imitating his father, landed near<br/>his crying sister, looking worried.<p>Akane wailed and shook her head, still holding the<br/>front of her face. She certainly wasn't going to<br/>admit that she had run from Sano though. Especially<br/>not to her brother, he'd tease her forever.<p>"Let's get you to the nurse and call home," Tenchi<br/>said, picking her up and running into the school.<p>Sano nervously watched the two disappear back into<br/>the school.<p>**********<p>"Jerk," Ranma said as he walked out of the<br/>principal's office, slamming the door just lightly<br/>enough not to damage it. His patience was thin, but<br/>he was only making a point, he didn't want to do any<br/>damage...yet.<p>He quieted down quickly upon seeing Akane in her<br/>mother's lap, eyes frightened and red from crying.<br/>Minagi sat quietly in her stroller and watched<p>"You feeling okay kid?"<p>"She's calming down," Ryoko said, stroking her<br/>hair. Her appearance showed that her own nerves were<br/>frayed and that she was probably in the category of<br/>"calming down" as well.<p>The bandage over her broken nose was quite<br/>disconcerting. They had been trying, mostly<br/>unsuccessfully, to inure themselves to the fact that<br/>Tenchi would probably be getting hurt quite a lot<br/>considering his desire to be a martial artist. It was<br/>an unwelcome expectation.<p>Something like this happening to Akane, who had<br/>little interest in fighting other than to watch her<br/>parents and friends, was an unwelcome surprise.<p>"She was playing with Sano," Tenchi said helpfully.<br/>He had already said that, of course, but he was sort<br/>of looking for some attention himself.<p>"I'll talk to Ryouga and Ukyou," Ranma said. Akane<br/>froze for a moment. "Maybe they can tell him to play<br/>a little more carefully."<p>"Yeah," Ryoko agreed. Then she looked to Tenchi<br/>and Akane and smiled. "Now how about some ice cream<br/>to cheer up?"<p>"Hai!" Akane and Tenchi shouted together, though<br/>Akane's voice sounded strange with the bandages over<br/>her broken nose.<p>**********<p>"So what had you so mad at the principal," Ryoko<br/>asked quietly.<p>She was watching Tenchi play a video game, some new<br/>game called Mortal Kombat or something, while Akane<br/>watched. It looked like a more violent version of<br/>that Streetfighter game he was always playing before.<br/>It would have concerned most parents, but for Ryoko it<br/>was rather trivial. She knew Ranma didn't approve of<br/>the 'fatalities' though, or the inaccuracies in the<br/>martial arts techniques. So she'd probably tell him to<br/>stop playing after a moment. For the moment Tenchi<br/>was away from hearing range though.<p>She glanced to Minagi, and wondered how much the<br/>one year old girl understood, but she WASN'T about to<br/>leave her unattended in any fashion.<p>"He suggested that we find a more 'appropriate'<br/>school for our children," Ranma growled. "Or give<br/>them home schooling. He didn't think the other<br/>students would "take to them" very well. Said it<br/>would be better if they left."<p>"Excuse me," Ryoko said. "What better school is<br/>there for the moment? Shampoo's kids, the Hibikis,<br/>Kaneda Tendo, your sister, and that Tarou kid all go<br/>to that school! What makes Akane and Tenchi diff..."<br/>She trailed off as she noticed that Ranma was turning<br/>tight-lipped.<p>"He didn't say exactly," Ranma tried to forestall.<p>"This is about what they inherited from me, right?"<br/>Ryoko asked, referring to the cat's eyes and tail<br/>Akane and Tenchi both had. The parts of her that most<br/>clearly screamed "I am not human."<p>"He didn't say," Ranma repeated, irritably. He<br/>looked back and sighed. "He's playing THAT game<br/>again." He frowned and then smirked at Ryoko, she<br/>caught the drift and smirked back.<p>"MMMMmmmm," Ryoko said loudly. "This triple fudge<br/>banana split is great, isn't it honey?" Akane and<br/>Tenchi froze for a moment, resulting in Tenchi's<br/>character getting pummeled.<p>"Yeah, I guess the kids don't want any," he<br/>said. "They're too busy playing video games. More<br/>for us and the baby then." Tenchi was almost<br/>instantly at the table with Akane close behind.<p>**********<p>"We spoke to Saotome-san today," Ryouga said to his<br/>son. "His daughter got hurt while you and she were<br/>playing."<p>"All that happened was she ran into the jungle<br/>gym," Sano said bitterly.<p>"They told us that," Ukyou said. "We just wanted<br/>to make sure you understood that you can't play the<br/>same games with her that you play with your brother<br/>and sister. It's not safe" Of course, Ukyou meant<br/>that it wasn't safe for Akane, but she didn't make<br/>that clear.<p>"H..hai," Sano said a little irritably.<p>"Besides," Ryouga said. "She's a Saotome, you have<br/>to watch out for them." In this case he meant that<br/>the Saotomes were family friends and they had to watch<br/>each other's backs, but, it didn't come out that way<br/>to Sano.<p>"Right, Dad," Sano said glumly. Even his own<br/>parents didn't think he could beat that girl. Well,<br/>he'd show them.<p>**********<p>"But I don't want to go," Akane said. Ryoko sighed<br/>irritably, yesterday Akane couldn't wait to go to<br/>school. Still, she shouldn't have been surprised<br/>after what had happened on the girl's first day.<p>"Just be careful on the playground," Ryoko said.<br/>"And you'll be fine. If you need any help, your<br/>brother and Aunt Ranko are just down the hall. And if<br/>that little Amazon witch bothers you, just tell me,<br/>okay."<p>"Lotion doesn't bother me," Akane said. "She wants<br/>to talk to all the time."<p>"There, you see," Ryoko said, gritting her teeth at<br/>that. "You've got a friend already."<p>"H..hai, kaasan," Akane sighed resignedly.<p>**********<p>"Akane you're hurt?" Lotion said in surprise.<p>"I ran into the jungle gym," Akane said.<p>"Oh," Lotion said. "It was an accident then." She<br/>seemed to be giving Akane an appraising look. Akane<br/>nodded and glanced nervously to Sano, who was glaring<br/>at her angrily. Akane winced and faced forward,<br/>sighing as the teacher came in.<p>**********<p>"What a coward," Aisha said, angrily. "Picking on<br/>a defenseless little girl." She winced and looked to<br/>Akane apologetically. "Oh, sorry about that, Akane."<p>"Aisha," Akane said. "I WAS a defenseless little<br/>girl. So no problem from me. After that, Lotion<br/>started to treat me like some sort of anomaly that she<br/>couldn't figure out. I was the great Ranma's<br/>daughter, but I couldn't fight. She seemed to think<br/>that was weird."<p>"So you chose to learn to defend yourself then?"<br/>Aisha said after a moment.<p>"Nope," Akane said. "I never even told my parents<br/>what was going on. They had to find out later."<p>"How did that happen?" Aisha asked.<p>**********<p>The sound of some one crying in the girl's room<br/>attracted the attention of a passing little girl and<br/>she blinked before following the sound to see what was<br/>wrong.<p>The stalls were closed, but the girl could see some<br/>other child's shows touching the floor towards the end<br/>of the bathroom. She gave an exasperated breath of<br/>air as she recognized the bright red shoes and<br/>realized who they belonged to. Still, it was wrong to<br/>leave someone crying like that, even a weirdo girl<br/>with a tail.<p>"Hello?" the girl asked. "My name's Yuki, are you<br/>okay?" The crying stopped for a moment.<p>"Go away," Akane said finally in a dry voice.<p>"Are you okay," the girl asked.<p>She saw from the position of Akane's feet that the<br/>girl was standing up. Suddenly the last stall door<br/>flew open and Akane stuck her head out, an enraged,<br/>tear-streaked face appeared. Her hair had been<br/>hacked ridiculously short and left ugly and uneven.<p>"There, you can laugh at me now!" Akane said. "Now<br/>go away!" She slammed the door shut again and<br/>continued crying. The result was not quite what Akane<br/>expected.<p>~Somebody cut her HAIR!~ Yuki realized.<p>She was still very young, but she was old enough to<br/>understand the special bond between a girl and her<br/>hair. It was something sacred, something not to be<br/>trifled with. She couldn't put that in such words,<br/>but she could voice the emotions fairly well.<p>"OH MY KAMI-SAMA!" she screamed, and ran to get<br/>the principal. ~Something MUST be done about THIS!~<p>**********<p>"SANO HIBIKI!"<p>Sano winced. When his father yelled like that it<br/>was bad. When his mother yelled like that, it<br/>generally meant the apocalypse for the individual<br/>named. To his knowledge, of the three Hibiki kids, he<br/>was the only yet to provoke both of them to yelling at<br/>once.<p>His sister, Midori, and brother, Jiro, looked up in<br/>shock and then turned to him in pity.<p>"What did you do, Sano?" Midori asked as the<br/>echoing quited down. Sano was quietly and shakily<br/>walking as if heading for a death sentence.<p>"I've never heard both of them yell," Jiro<br/>remarked, impressed and frightened. Ukyou appeared in<br/>the doorway to the room and glared at her son,<br/>pointing at him.<p>"You come here now!" Ukyou said in a low and angry<br/>voice.<p>"Hai, Okaasan," Sano said quietly, walking out of<br/>the room with his mother watching.<p>"I can't believe you," Ukyou said, ashamed.<p>**********<p>"THE LITTLE MONSTER CUT YOUR HAIR!" Aisha<br/>shouted. Eyes were directed toward them again.<p>"Sssh, sssh," Akane said. "Keep it down." It was<br/>too late, they were suddenly all surrounded by the<br/>female police officers all looking aghast.<p>"That's horrible," one of them said. "Who...wait,<br/>your hair is the same as always."<p>"She's talking about this little deliquent hellion<br/>that tormented her in her early school years," Aisha<br/>declared.<p>"Ohhh," the staff said. "Well, get on with it."<p>"Yes," Aisha said. "Is that finally when you<br/>started training to defend yourself?"<p>"No," Akane said embrassedly. "I still wasn't<br/>interested in fighting except as a spectator."<p>"So what happened to change your mind?" somebody<br/>asked.<p>"As I remember it was assault and battery," an<br/>older voice said as Captain Makibi walked into the<br/>discussion, ignoring the surprised looks she got for<br/>not breaking up the casual gathering. "That was a<br/>very bad event."<p>"Hai," Akane said, growling and angry.<p>**********<p>"Hey," Yuki said, looking around. "Where's Akane?"<p>"Yeah," another girl said, also confused as she<br/>looked up and down the hall. "Why isn't she here?"<p>It was hard to miss the girl with that emerald hair<br/>and that tail, and she almost never missed a chance to<br/>go out with her friends, now that she had some.<p>Yuki imagined it had something to do with living up<br/>at that shrine with her parents, there probably<br/>weren't all that many visitors.<p>"I'm sure she'll show up," Yuki said scratching her<br/>head and leaning back against the lockers on the wall.<br/>The school was a converted high school, and they saw<br/>no reason not to leave the lockers even though these<br/>were just elementary school kids.<p>The knocking sound on the locker behind caused both<br/>girls to jump in shock and a little fear. The<br/>knocking continued to come from the shut locker. A<br/>locker plenty large enough to hold a small for her age<br/>second grader.<p>"Uhh," Yuki said. "Akane?" The knocking got more<br/>incessant.<p>About fifteen minutes later the school was working<br/>on a way to get the girl out of the locker. It seemed<br/>that the keys to the lockers had been lost and no one<br/>could find the combination. The appearance of a<br/>practically terrified Ranma and Ryoko caused quite a<br/>stir. This was mostly because their appearance was<br/>just that.<p>One moment they weren't there, the next moment they<br/>were. Ryoko flew to the locker, and practically<br/>shoved everybody out of the way. Sticking her head<br/>through the solid metal locker, without damaging it,<br/>acquired quite a few more stares.<p>Whatever she said to Akane was too quite to hear,<br/>but when she came out she was boiling bad and using a<br/>small dagger of energy to cut open the locker. After<br/>cutting the door open, Ranma ripped it off its<br/>hinges. Then they cautiously, gently pulled their<br/>daughter out.<p>Akane's tail had been pulled between her legs and<br/>used to tie her hands together, and this time she was<br/>bald. Needless to say she had been crying for a long<br/>time, though the sock being used to gag her had kept<br/>her muffled enough not to be heard until she started<br/>hitting the side of the locker.<p>"That little rat," Ranma growled as he untied her<br/>tail. Ryoko had removed the gag and was hugging her<br/>terrified daughter, talking to her softly. Ryoko was<br/>thinking the same thing Ranma was.<p>The first time this had happened she had wanted to<br/>do something about the little hellion herself, but<br/>Ranma had convinced her to let the Hibikis handle it.<br/>And they had tried, Ryoko had to give them that. Now<br/>it was their turn.<p>**********<p>"She's had nightmares for the past two days," Ranma<br/>growled. "She's terrified about the idea of walking<br/>out of the house."<p>"Yes, Midori and Jiro told us," Ryouga said,<br/>ashamedly. Ukyou sighed and looked down away from the<br/>angry eyes of two of her closest friends.<p>"We're cutting Sano out of our school," Ukyou said.<br/>"Until he can prove himself to be disciplined we're<br/>not going to train him any longer."<p>"That's not good enough," Ryoko snapped.<p>"It is the best way I think to get it through to<br/>him that this is a disgrace," Ukyou returned angrily.<p>She wasn't really angry at Ranma and Ryoko, they<br/>had every right to do a number of things in<br/>retaliation. She just wasn't willing to abandon her<br/>son, even if the problem were his own making.<p>"I'm sorry," Nabiki said from where she was sitting<br/>with the other individual that Ranma and Ryoko had<br/>consulted. "They're right, just cutting Sano off from<br/>learning isn't going to be enough. He still knows<br/>what you've already taught him."<p>"He might even decide it's her fault and this will<br/>escalate again," Kiyone said. "I heard the boy myself<br/>yell at the two of you that he wasn't going to let a<br/>'Saotome' get the better of him by running off and<br/>tattling everytime she lost."<p>"It's just like when you hated me," Ranma said.<br/>Ryoko's narrowed eyes revealed everything she thought<br/>on the matter. She wasn't going to bring up Nagi<br/>right now, but the comparison was heavy on her mind.<p>"And Akane can't defend herself," Ryoko growled<br/>angrily finally.<p>"What if she could," Ukyou asked suddenly.<p>"Excuse me?" Ranma asked.<p>"Akane isn't interested in being a fighter," Ryoko<br/>reminded everybody.<p>"Whether she's interested in it or not," Ryouga<br/>said, following his wife's lead. The alternative was<br/>the Saotomes pressing charges. "I don't think this<br/>will be the last time she gets challenged because of<br/>who her parents are."<p>"They may be right," Nabiki said reluctantly. "She<br/>might need some teaching. And maybe taking her out of<br/>school for a little bit of training trip would be a<br/>good idea."<p>"I'm not taking her on a training trip," Ranma<br/>said. He frowned though.<p>"Please, Ranchan," Ukyou said. "Maybe if she's<br/>capable of standing up to him, then maybe he won't<br/>hate her anymore. I don't want to see my son grow up<br/>to become a mindless thug."<p>"It worked with us," Ryouga said, hopefully.<p>"It didn't work with Nagi," Ryoko growled.<p>"That's what we're trying to avoid here," Kiyone<br/>said. "Another Nagi."<p>"I'm sure Hinako will be willing to do some<br/>home-teaching while you have her training," Nabiki<br/>added. "My stepmother has been interested in getting<br/>back on the job market."<p>"Please Ranma," Ryouga begged, while Ukyou looked<br/>on, hopefully. "Ryoko?"<p>"We'll try it," Ranma said.<p>**********<p>"I trained with my parents and the Hibikis for four<br/>years. It didn't work very well," Akane said. "But<br/>that might be my fault."<p>"Huh?" Aisha asked.<p>"Well," Kiyone said. "Detective Saotome was<br/>supposed to use just enough force to show that she<br/>wasn't a push over anymore. Instead she publically<br/>humiliated him, by wiping the floor with him. All it<br/>did was spur him to get better than her."<p>"Wasn't he cut off from any training?" somebody<br/>asked.<p>"He found ways to train himself," Akane said. "And<br/>he'd always been more into that stuff than I was. So<br/>he caught up with me kinda fast. I had to work hard<br/>to stay competitive with him."<p>"What happened eventually?" Aisha asked.<br/>"He came by near the end of senior year with some<br/>sort of magical artifact," Akane said. "He used it,<br/>and vanished. His parents were horrified, nobody's<br/>seen him since. I feel sorry for Auntie Ukyou and<br/>Hibiki-sensei, but I can't say I was too sad."<p>"I can understand why, after going through all<br/>that," the other women agreed sagely.<p>"And why are you all in uniform, Aisha?" Akane<br/>asked. "I don't think we have any sort of ceremony to<br/>attend."<p>"Oh, that's what I was coming to see you about,"<br/>Aisha said, reluctantly. "I'm being called back home<br/>to be an ambassador."<p>"What?" Akane gasped cheerfully. "That's great!<br/>Congratulations, Aisha!"<p>"It's just this little rock in space," Aisha said.<br/>"Not even a planet." Poor Aisha had no idea that she<br/>was heading to her first encounter with the Outlaw<br/>Star.<p>"Still," Akane said. "It's better than being an on<br/>loan officer from the Ctarl Ctarl. Way to go...wait,<br/>that means I get a new partner."<p>"He's supposed to arrive today," Kiyone confirmed.<br/>"Haven't gotten the file on him yet, of course, but<br/>he's supposed to be native to this area. So they<br/>assigned him to the Sol system."<p>"Excuse me," someone said from behind the large<br/>group of women. "I'm supposed to find my new partner<br/>here. I can't read these symbols, but that man over<br/>there said she was in this large group of women when I<br/>showed it to him."<p>Behind the group of women was a tall, large, brown<br/>haired man with fangs and an angular face looking<br/>rather tired. He scratched his head as he looked down<br/>at the paper again. A gasp of horrified recognition<br/>almost drew his attention up.<p>"Wait...I figured it out," Sano said proudly. "I'm<br/>looking for a Detective First<br/>Class...Akane...Saotome." He spoke slowly, voice<br/>turning to a whimper as he stumbled over her name.<p>He blinked once and looked up to where Captain<br/>Makibi, with her dark green hair, stood next to a<br/>woman with lighter, shining emerald hair in one long<br/>pony tail. A young woman who was even now crushing the arms<br/>of her chair and glaring at him with her teeth<br/>clenched.<p>"Oh, the kami hate me," he said quietly. Kiyone<br/>quietly took Akane's sidearm away while she was<br/>distracted and made sure it was out of reach.<p>"Saaaaaaa-" Akane hissed under her breath.<br/>Suddenly Sano noted the eyes of the other women were<br/>all narrowed and glaring at him.<p>"Uhh...you told them about the hair," he said.<br/>"Didn't you?"<p>"-nnnnnoooo,"<p>"We were just talking about you," Aisha confirmed.<p>"Hiiiiiiii-"<p>"This is going to hurt a lot," he said faintly.<p>"-biiiiiiii-<p>"Isn't it?" Sano finished.<p>"-kiiiiii!"<p>"Would it help if I said I was sorry?" Sano asked.<p>The look in Akane's face as she slowly stood up<br/>said no.
