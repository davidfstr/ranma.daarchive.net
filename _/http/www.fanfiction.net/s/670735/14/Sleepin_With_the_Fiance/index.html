</div><p>Chapter 14</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/>Author's Note: Sorry this took so long getting out! There's not much left now! I'm already working on another R/A story since they are like the <i>best</i> out there!<hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>The photo center worker thumbed through a stack of new arrivals and pulled two from the stack. "Here you go, Miss Kuonji."<p>Ukyo smiled and paid for her pictures. She had waited a few days after the roof thing between Ranma and Akane to pick the pictures up. Her brain had been boiling hard trying to get a new way of attack. She knew they were faking it! She just knew it!<p>Normally the couple would have buckled after all this time but anything was possible when they had Nabiki on their side. She was amazed to know that Shampoo had even thrown in the apron and said she couldn't interfere anymore.<p>According to law.<p>She thought it strange, but Shampoo told that Cologne had ordered her to stay away from Akane. And if it meant Akane, it also went for Ranma. Shaking her head, the chef crossed the street and started to flip through her package of pictures.<p>When she came to the one she had taken of them signing their marriage license, the girl's face broke into a grin as she ran the rest of the way back to the dojo.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma and Akane sat in their room, both sleeping on the bed. It had been a hard couple of days ever since Kuno caught wind, finally, about the supposed marriage. He had threatened Ranma, tried to woo Akane and ended up with two fists in his face at least three times a day.<p>Of course, what Kuno knew, Kodachi would find out. And, oh, did she find out. The 'Black Rose' was mad with jealousy and had bombarded Akane with accusations and powders. Ranma had pulled off another close save in the end by sweet talking his way in and out of trouble.<p>Akane had given Kodachi a few good kicks before the couple took off home. As soon as they trudged through the door they went straight to bed.<p>In the safety of their bed, the couple slept soundly. Nabiki was sent to wake them up instead she stood in the doorway with her camera raised and finger hovering over the trigger.<p>This would be priceless! Ranma's arm as Akane's pillow as she faced each other, as the other one was wrapped protectively around her waist. One of Akane's hands were resting lightly on Ranma's bicep and the other one was placed on his chest. It was sickening sweet position.<p>Sighing and clicking, the flash stirred the couple. Before they would come around fully, Nabiki tucked the camera in her back pocket. "Come on you two. Ukyo thinks she finally has you two cornered." With that, the middle sister turned and left, shutting the door behind her.<p>Ranma's eyes were half opened and still trying to focus.<p>Akane was still mostly asleep. She was too warm and tired right now. Attempting to get closer to the warm spot, the blue haired girl snuggled closer to where it was.<p>"If we don't get up, Ukchan is going to come in here to get us out." The warmth was able to speak? The rumblings from the warm spot sounded like-Ranma? Akane's sleep hit the road running as her eyes flew open and she pushed back from the warmth.<p>Ranma's eyes were still closed, but one black eyebrow was slightly raised.<p>"Uh," the girl started, backing up quickly. "We better go then."<p>Ranma let her go, his sleep filled mind slowly thawing into wakefulness. Akane was already muttering something and heading towards the door. A minutes later, the young man's brain calculated the last five minutes and he sat bolt upright.<p><i>No way, Akane would have reamed me if I was anywhere near her.</i> Shaking away the fear and shock, the boy threw back the covers and followed in his 'wife's' footsteps.<p>Kasumi was passing out tea for those sitting in the living room when Ranma finally took up his seat next to Akane. Ukyo was smiling merrily as the couple yawned and stretched.<p>"Don't worry, Ranma-honey, you won't have to be sitting over there much longer." Ukyo plucked a picture from the pack and slapped it down on the table triumphantly. "As you can see, there is no marriage license."<p>"Oh, my." Kasumi touched her cheek lightly.<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes as she watched the couple pale.<p>The print had been enlarged to where Ranma and Akane's hands were signing the marriage license at their ceremony. Except for saying 'certificate of marriage' it said 'Permission slip'.<p>"But I'm a fair girl," Ukyo smiled. "I'll give you one day to come clean. Games over."</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>That night the couple was thankful for their earlier nap. Akane was curled up on her side, silent tears trickling slowly down her face. She couldn't face Ranma. How was she going to explain her tears to him?<p>"'kane." Ranma wasn't so calloused by the years on the road to not notice a silent crier. The guilt ate away at him, knowing she was upset because they were really going to have to marry or come clean. What he didn't know was Akane was crying because either way, she lost him. "Don't cry about it, 'kane."<p>"I-I'm not crying." She sniffled to prove her point.<p>Ranma touched her lightly on the shoulder, "I'll tell them tomorrow." He sighed discontentedly. "You won't have to do this anymore."<p>"That's not it, dummy." Akane turned towards him. It was dark, maybe he wouldn't see just <i>how</i> bad she looked.<p>He was laying on his side, facing her. "Then what is it?"<p>Akane opened her mouth to reply, but slowly closed it. His hand lay between the both of them, there wasn't much room in the valley of their bodies but it lay there nonetheless. The plain golden band seemed to almost glow on his finger. It wasn't possible, Akane realized, and more than likely was just the way the moonlight hit the metal.<p>Ranma was more than relieved to see a small smile on his 'wife's' soon to be demoted yet again to fiancée's face.<p>"Don't worry about it." She whispered, closing her eyes. Her hand searched out his blindly. Ranma returned her smile, though unseen, when he noticed that her hand was about seven inches too low.<p>Aiding her, the pig tailed boy grabbed the girl's smaller hand and squeezed it gently.<p>At least their last night wouldn't be in a huge fight.</p><hr noshade="" size="1"/><p>Ranma sighed as he balanced on the top of his head. He had to come clean, for Akane's sake…because the gig was up. All that was left was to tell Ukyo, even though the girl already knew. Flipping easily up to his feet, the boy scratched the back of his neck as he studied the floor boards.<p>Sighing, he turned on his heel and walked towards his fate.<p>His fate came in the form of four girls. None of them the one he was looking forward to having for support. Shampoo, Ukyo, and Akane's sisters were there but no Akane.<p>"Where's Akane?"<p>Ukyo bristled. "She went out to do some window shopping or something."<p>"Shampoo only here because money girl ask." Shampoo eyed the smirking Nabiki carefully.<p>"Why don't you sit down, Ranma? Have some tea?" The ever thoughtful Kasumi suggested, placing a cup in front of the nervous boy.<p>"So, Ranma, have you decided to stop playing and start accepting the fact that you are going to be <i>my</i> husband?" Ukyo switched her eyes over from Ranma to Shampoo to see if the girl would protest and start one of their normal fights.<p>The Amazon only growled in her throat and tightened her fists.<p>"Ranma," Nabiki interjected. "Can you go upstairs and get my notebook that's on my dresk? Thanks."<p>Dumbfounded, Ranma slowly got up and made his way up the stairs. While thrumming through the multiple papers on Nabiki's desk, he heard a shrill of declaration and then a roar of adamant denial.<p>Forgetting the notebook, Ranma easy black flipped to the first floor and rushed into the room where the meeting was suppose to take place.<p>Only the Tendo girls were present.<p>"Wh-where'd they go?" Ranma asked, baffled.<p>"Oh them? Don't worry. Shampoo probably stomped off to the Cat Café and Ukyo probably is running towards town." The brunette shrugged.<p>"How did you get them to leave?"<p>Kasumi also insisted upon knowing since for the two seconds she excused herself, she had missed all the happenings. "Okay, I'm in a generous mood." Ranma became ten times more suspicious at those words. "When I was doing a school report of our ancestors I found out some very intriguing things. For one, our great-grandmother's real name wasn't Sada. It was Clip."<p>"Clip?" Kasumi echoed, tipping her head. "Like a hair clip?"<p>"Precisely. Turns out, sister, we are descended from the Amazons.' Nabiki smirked. "Since you and Akane were <i>technically</i> engaged since you beat her before Shampoo, her right out weighs Shampoo's. Not to mention I think Cologne knew Clip personally."<p>Ranma's mind was reeling. The Tendos were Amazons? He felt faint.<p>"That explains Shampoo's sudden departure." Kasumi trailed off. "But how did you convince Ukyo?"<p>"Oh, I showed her this." Ranma snatched the piece of paper from the middle sister's hands. His eyes roamed over the photocopied piece of paper as he felt his throat dry up.<p>"A marriage license." Ranma's choking sounds carried out to the street.
