</div>...I have no idea from this point on...<br/>[ IHNIFTPO ]<p>Ranma's Wish, Chapter 4<br/>By Felix Webster ( Felix Warstar )<br/>[felix_]<p>All original Ranma ½ Characters Copyright Rumiko Takahashi (first<br/>published by Shogakugan in Japan and brought over to North America by<br/>Viz Communications), and are used without permission. Please don't<br/>sue... cause I have no money.<p>" " - speech<br/>* * - thoughts<br/>( ) - other languages - Chinese mostly -<br/>[ ] - Panda signs<p>- People in the Past -<p>Ryoga Hibiki ran a hand through his wild hair with a nervous smile<br/>on his face as he accepted a handshake from the newest student with<br/>his other hand, "Ryoga Hibiki. . . um, thanks for the help."<p>"Ranma Saotome," the smaller boy smiled back. They both looked at<br/>the twenty plus others in unconscious heaps all around them. "What<br/>was that all about?"<p>Ryoga seemed unhappy about the whole thing but he was even more<br/>unhappy about having to explain. He really didn't know the other boy<br/>yet, but it was Ranma who helped him actually get to school on time.<br/>. . and to win the bet on that unlikely possibility, "I would assume<br/>they bet against me getting to the school this week. . ."<p>"Now that sounds like a silly bet," Ranma gave the piles of human<br/>bones and flesh a disbelieving look. "You only live five blocks from<br/>here."<p>Ryoga felt the anger rise at hearing that 'little' fact but calmed<br/>it as he realized Ranma didn't know of his curse. Squaring his<br/>shoulders he did something he never liked even thinking about, "I<br/>have a terrible sense of direction."<p>"It can't be that bad. . . can it?" Ranma tried to take the<br/>confession as a joke but Ryoga's expression make Ranma's eyes go wide.<p>"It's a family curse," Ryoga cringed involuntarily as he continued.<br/>"Both of my parents have it to a lesser degree. . . it just kinda<br/>combined in me."<p>"That's. . that's rough man," Ranma replied sounding truly<br/>concerned. "How do you get around if you get so lost?"<p>"Our pet dog is trained to find us and lead us home. . . other than<br/>that it's a gamble," Ryoga shrugged as he picked up his school bag<br/>but still didn't move to enter the school. "But she's out looking for<br/>my Dad right now."<p>"Was that place I met you close to your house?" Ranma asked as he<br/>noticed the other students moving inside with more speed.<p>"That lot is right behind my house. . . which has a large sign on it<br/>that says 'Hibiki Residence'" Ryoga smiled nervously putting his hand<br/>behind his head out of reflex.<p>"Great! I'd love to see a place designed for that kind of problem,"<br/>Ranma gave Ryoga a friendly smile as he grabbed Ryoga's hand and<br/>started to drag the bigger teen into the school. "I'll help you get<br/>home after school, but right now we have to get to our classes."<p>Ryoga was speechless, he had a friend. Someone who didn't question<br/>his curse. Someone who simply looked past it. And for some<br/>incomprehensible reason having his hand in the person's hand made him<br/>blush.<p>- - - -<p>The cafeteria was a pure mad house. Mad because so many boys wanted<br/>to eat the food made there, crazy as it may seem, and Ryoga barely<br/>made there. He had been getting to school so regularly that the<br/>school's betting pool was drying up on that, but Ranma let him figure<br/>out his own way to things like the bathroom and the cafeteria. He<br/>wasn't doing so bad actually, as long as Ranma was in class he could<br/>find it for some reason. . . not always quickly but he would find it.<br/>That was why he was sure Ranma was in the cafeteria somewhere.<p>"The last two egg and seaweed salad sandwiches coming up!" the Lunch<br/>lady called out over the roar coming from the mass of boys standing<br/>and waiting like caged animals. She threw the two daily specials into<br/>the air, "After that they're all gone!"<p>Ryoga would have made a move on the flying objects as he actually<br/>like the combination but he held back as he saw a flash of movement<br/>snagging both and Ranma landing next to him holding one out to him<br/>with a smile and a sarcastic comment, "They as just soooo slow at<br/>this school!"<p>Ichiro Kaniko, the school's book maker and all around scumbag, gave<br/>the pair a wilting glare as he and his three henchmen all turned<br/>around each with a foot print on their faces, "I see ,Hibiki, that<br/>you and your 'girlfriend' are at it again. Can't you two be all lovey<br/>dovey out of public view you pervs?"<p>"Ryoga! Just leave it," Ranma barely caught hold of the back of<br/>Ryoga's school jacket before he could get them both into trouble.<br/>"You know the principal's rules on fighting. I really don't want to<br/>get suspended."<p>"Besides," Ranma added as he calmed down his friend and saw the smug<br/>sneer on Ichiro's face, "we both know he's just jealous that he can't<br/>have you himself."<p>Both faces dropped but Ryoga recovered before Ichiro, "I don't care<br/>what kind of pervert he is, I'm straight!"<p>"Much to his disappointment I'm sure," Ranma snickered again cutting<br/>off Ichiro's protests.<p>"I'M NOT GAY!" Ichiro screamed in frustration making everyone who<br/>hadn't already watched the display turn and look at him.<p>"They why such an interest in Ryoga?" Ranma smiled evilly. "It's<br/>almost an unhealthy obsession."<p>"I'M NOT OBSESSED WITH HIBIKI!" Ichiro screamed totally red faced<br/>as even his own lackeys were trying not to laugh. "I don't give a<br/>damn about the terminally lost boy!"<p>"Then stop acting like you do!" Ranma spun away and put a hand on<br/>Ryoga's back to push him outside.<p>A little while later both Ranma and Ryoga were sitting under a very<br/>shady tree, Ryoga devouring the sandwich and Ranma bringing out two<br/>bentos.<p>"Mom figured you'd need one," Ranma smiled as he handed the larger<br/>box to Ryoga, who looked at it with both shock and hunger. "I mean<br/>your mother can't always make you one."<p>"I don't get it. . . you've been nice to me since we met," Ryoga<br/>said between bites happy to see the same gust for eating was being<br/>now mirrored by Ranma. It caused him to blush for reasons that he<br/>could not explain.<p>"Why shouldn't I be?" Ranma blinked in confusion. "You're a friend.<br/>You don't treat friends like Ichiro treats his lackeys."<p>"What about when we met? Why?" Ryoga looked like this had been<br/>bothering him for quite awhile.<p>"I saw you dent a post box out of frustration and I knew you were<br/>strong. I saw you were skilled in the art and in what looked like a<br/>simular school as me. People like us can only really be either close<br/>friends or bitter rivals. . . I would rather have a friend," Ranma<br/>explained patting Ryoga on the back. " Besides, you're the only<br/>person other than Pop I can spar with without holding back."<p>Ryoga joined Ranma in laughing and when his friend's head was down<br/>he noticed that the hair near Ranma's roots had gone red. He shrugged<br/>it off figuring it wasn't any of his business.<p>- - - -<p>Weeks passed. Both still got razzed and bugged about being a couple<br/>by Ichiro. Both still continued as the best of friends, even though<br/>Ryoga started to feel real weird around Ranma. They sparred every<br/>other day, ate together, and hung out at Ryoga's house all the time.<br/>They didn't bother going to Ranma's anymore as Mrs. Saotome just<br/>seemed too overjoyed about their friendship. Mr. Saotome kept hinting<br/>at a pairing of Ryoga and what he assumed was Ranma's twin sister,<br/>who was off at boarding school for the legally challenged. . .<br/>according to Ranma. Ranma pointed out that his sister took after his<br/>father's side of the family. Things didn't change much until near the<br/>end of the term. . . then they turned totally to hell.<p>Ranma and his dad were late getting back from a training weekend, so<br/>that Monday left Ryoga to try to get to find the school himself. He<br/>actually didn't get too badly lost as he knew he was still in the<br/>right ward when he came upon the park. He just hoped he would find<br/>someone there to get him to school.<p>After a few minutes of looking around he heard sniffled crying<br/>coming from nearby. Worried that someone was badly hurt he headed<br/>straight toward the sound. What he found was a fellow classmate<br/>sitting on a bench looking like he had been used as a kendo practice<br/>dummy, "Soeda?"<p>". . . Ryoga Hibiki?" Soeda looked up with only one good, but very<br/>red eye making the beating look worse. Ryoga was suddenly very<br/>uncomfortable as Soeda was one of only three openly gay boys at<br/>school, and the only one actually in his class.<p>A small battle raged inside of Ryoga. On one side he didn't want to<br/>be seen with such a pervert, but on the other Soeda had been beaten<br/>brutally. Everyone knew Soeda wouldn't lift a finger to defend<br/>himself, he was a pacifist, so hitting him was like kicking a puppy.<br/>In a sack. Only someone with no honour would do that! Ranma would<br/>never forgive him if he didn't deal with this. Sitting down near the<br/>other boy Ryoga narrowed his eyes, "Ichiro?"<p>"Mostly his goons. . . but yes, Ichiro," Soeda said looking away<br/>embarrassed.<p>"Why?" Ryoga asked calmly even though the rage was building to<br/>boiling, he had to focus on the confidence training that Ranma helped<br/>him build to transfer the anger to more useful activities, like<br/>planing Ichiro's pain.<p>"Because of you and Saotome," Soeda replied earning him a confused<br/>look from Ryoga. "He's a closed-minded bigot who is venting the fact<br/>that you and Saotome are flaunting you relationship in front of him<br/>on the rest of us."<p>"We're just friends!" Ryoga bolted upright, the rage following back<br/>to it's old patterns and the training all but forgotten.<p>"Uh huh, right," Soeda said nearly sarcastically but then waved it<br/>off to continue. "Either way Ichiro is pissed off and taking it out<br/>on anyone he even thinks is gay since none of them could take either<br/>you or Saotome."<p>"I'll have a talk with Ichiro about that," Ryoga replied through<br/>gritted teeth. "When I find the school. . ."<p>"Where's Saotome? Doesn't he help you get to school each morning?"<br/>Soeda asked realizing finally that Ryoga was alone and not with his<br/>friend. "You two have a spat?"<p>"We're not like that!" Ryoga countered nearly freaking completely<br/>out then calmed down a bit. "Him and his Dad are late getting back<br/>from a training trip."<p>"Oh?" Soeda gave Ryoga a concerned look as much as his smashed face<br/>would allow.<p>"Why do people keep assuming. . keep assuming me and Ranma are perv.<br/>. more than best friends?" Ryoga asked as he sat back down depressed,<br/>it had really bothered him from the first time Ichiro started it and<br/>it had gotten any better. Ichiro wasn't the only person either, too<br/>many people had made that assumption. Heck, Soeda was gay and even he<br/>made that assumption!<p>"Um. . how should I say this. . ." Soeda started as he gave the<br/>large, and very strong boy a worried glance. Figuring he couldn't<br/>hurt much more than he already did he decided to actually explain<br/>what he saw. "It's the way you two look at each other. . . no, more<br/>the way you look at Saotome really. The happiness in you eyes from<br/>just being near him says so much. When you mentioned that Ranma<br/>wasn't back yet the pain and loneliness was obvious. Whether you want<br/>to believe it or not you are in love with Saotome. . . and the rest<br/>of us are envious that you found someone like that."<p>"Look, I'm willing to deal with Ichiro for you. . to get him to at<br/>least lay off, but don't try putting your twisted views on Ranma's<br/>and my friendship," Ryoga stated coldly and stood up. "Now I need you<br/>to get me to the school."<p>Soeda didn't look happy about going back but agreed.<p>- - - -<p>It was the last of the school classes for the term and Ryoga,<br/>although still the best friend he could be, was distant of late. His<br/>mind was working overtime on what Soeda had said, the idea still did<br/>not want to file itself into his brain. It wasn't that he denied his<br/>feelings for Ranma to himself anymore. . . it was that he didn't<br/>believe he was gay. Nope. Nada. Not interested in guys!<p>He didn't feel the slightest bit attracted to any other guy, and<br/>when a girl he ran into one weekend tried to kiss him for saving her<br/>cat he fainted from blood loss at the idea that a girl was being that<br/>kind to him. But when he even thought about Ranma his heart soared.<p>Finally he made up his mind, he had given Ranma a note the day<br/>before and wouldn't answer any of Ranma's questions about what it<br/>meant.<p>Ranma had not been happy about what Ichiro had done to Soeda when he<br/>found out, but to Ryoga it seemed the anger came for different<br/>reasons. Both of them had confronted Ichiro at different times to<br/>'discuss' with him his behaviour, and after Ranma's little talk<br/>Ichiro took ill and had to finish the term by correspondence.<p>"Remember, me and Pop are training in China this summer so I can't<br/>do much because I have to pack," Ranma reminded as he walked away<br/>from Ryoga's house holding the note and still confused as to why his<br/>friend would challenge him.<p>". . . maybe he found out I'm a girl? It would explain why he's been<br/>so distant lately," Ranma said to herself as she tried to figure this<br/>all out and continued to her own house.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma stood in the empty lot looking very annoyed. She had been<br/>there for three days already and Ryoga was nowhere to be seen! He<br/>lived just behind the lot for heaven's sake! And she was cold,<br/>hungry, and very wet from the recent rain during the early morning.<p>"What are you doing girl!" Genma demanded loudly as he stood to one<br/>side and did not like the look of his daughter's state. "Your Mother<br/>nearly killed me when you didn't come home. . . two days ago!"<p>"Sorry Pop," Ranma replied apologetically. "Ryoga challenged me but<br/>he hasn't shown up yet."<p>"Why would that boy what to challenge you?" Genma looked confused.<br/>"You two were nearly inseparable. . . Wait! You didn't tell him did<br/>you! I know your Mother would be happy about you finally having a<br/>boyf. . ."<p>"No Pop, I didn't tell him!" Ranma cut her Father off before<br/>something completely uncomfortable was said. "He may have figured it<br/>out for himself though. . . it would explain the challenge if he felt<br/>betrayed by me for not telling him."<p>"Either way we can't wait for the boy any longer," Genma waved it<br/>all off as he put a hand on his daughter's shoulder. "Whatever it is<br/>it can wait for when we get back. Your Mother wants to say goodbye<br/>before we leave. . . and you could use some dry clothes."<p>"I guess Pop," Ranma walked out the lot with her Father, she was not<br/>happy but he was right it could wait until they got back from China.<br/>"I really wanted to clear this up before going though. . . it might<br/>really a potential problem later."<p>- - - -<p>One half hour later Ryoga Hibiki ran into the vacant lot, dirt<br/>encrusted on his clothes from hard travel. He slowed to a slower pace<br/>as he walked onto the turned ground from the pavement and carried a<br/>bouquet of very dead roses as if they were precious as life itself.<br/>He stopped dead in his tracks when he realized that Ranma was not to<br/>be seen anywhere. Knowing his own problems he took a moment to make<br/>sure it was the right lot then cursed as he knew he was where he<br/>wanted to be. Ranma knew enough about his curse to know to wait for<br/>him to finally get to the lot. . . but Ranma wasn't there.<p>Ryoga felt a sensation that he hadn't felt since he was a child, he<br/>wanted to cry.<p>He stopped it before it started by fuelling the grief and pain into<br/>the rage. Ranma didn't care, if he did he would have been there! No,<br/>Ranma must have known what Ryoga was going to say! He must have<br/>guessed what Ryoga had only recently understood for himself recently.<br/>He knew and he chose to make a fool of Ryoga! Ranma never ignored a<br/>challenge, but he wasn't there!<p>Ryoga's rage blinded his reason so totally that he missed the muddy<br/>tracks that led out of the lot, still fresh. Instead he crushed the<br/>roses and screamed to the heavens, "RANMA SAOTOME!"<p>"I'LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR TOYING WITH MY HEART!"<p>"I WILL HAVE REVENGE ON YOU FOR MAKING ME QUESTION MY MANHOOD!"<p>"I WILL FOLLOW YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH, AND INTO HELL ITSELF IF<br/>I HAVE TO MAKE YOU PAY!"<p>Ryoga ran out of the vacant lot as his mind let him remember where<br/>Ranma should be going, China, and that wasn't very hard to get to!<p>- - - -<p>Ranma stumbled as a feeling of dread washed over her and Genma<br/>actually had to catch her before she ended face first. She couldn't<br/>explain it but suddenly she felt as if she was alone in the world<br/>again. She hadn't felt like since before making friends with Ryoga<br/>and she didn't like that fact that feeling came back as they walked<br/>in to the Saotome family home to get ready to leave for China. "I<br/>should have stayed. . ."<p>"You are in no state to stand there any longer," Genma replied even<br/>though he knew she was talking to herself. "As it is I think you<br/>should stay home for a day or two so you can recover you health."<p>"No Pop, I'm fine. It's passed already," Ranma reassured her Father<br/>and stood up straight putting a look of determination "I'm not<br/>putting off going to China for even one more day. I have a feeling it<br/>will be the most important training trip we've ever done. . . I feel<br/>that I'm destined to learn the greatest of all Martial skills from<br/>this trip and I won't miss that for anything!"<p>"That's the girl I raised!" Genma smiled and hugged his daughter<br/>proud at her drive, her determination to be the best.<p>- - - -<p>Akane barely responded to her older sister's questions, she tried to<br/>focus but it was so hard. Her family's concern was lessening finally<br/>as she actually was getting better, she at least talked to people<br/>now. She was so bad that she hadn't even tried to defend herself when<br/>Shampoo attacked her demanding to know where she hide Ranma. It had<br/>been up to her Father and Genma to start defending her from the<br/>onslaught that Ranma's missing caused. The two showed many why it was<br/>that one had a Dojo and the other had trained one of the strongest<br/>Martial Artist of the age, even Cologne was finally impressed with<br/>them.<p>It had be several weeks since Ranma disappeared by wishing himself<br/>away, but not long enough for Akane to wish to idiot back. During<br/>that time she had a mental breakdown and nothing anyone tried brought<br/>her out of it. But know she was almost ready. Almost back. The spark<br/>was coming. The anger.<p>She was coming back to herself because the time was coming and she<br/>needed to be centered to face it right. She needed to think, to come<br/>up with a wish that brought Ranma back to her. . . without ruining<br/>what he had wished for. He had tried to solve it all, the curse, the<br/>fiances, and the rivals in one go. . . and according to the old<br/>shopkeeper Ranma got his wish, if only after a fashion, and she<br/>wasn't going to ruin it for him but she needed him back!<p>"Akane? Akane, I asked what you plan to do about that stone?" Nabiki<br/>said again as she snapped her fingers in front of her younger<br/>sister's face.<p>"Wha. . Huh? Sorry Nabiki," Akane replied out of reflex still no<br/>emotion in her tone.<p>"That wishing stone you mentioned. . . I went to the shop you talked<br/>about and the old shopkeeper actually showed it to me," Nabiki looked<br/>disturbed at what she remembered was in the shop. "You're going to<br/>have to have a plan and a wish ready as that guy isn't going to wait<br/>for you, if someone else gets there first they get the wish and we<br/>have to wait again."<p>"He told me to come back," Akane said softly not understanding,<br/>Nabiki just said the old man wasn't waiting for her.<p>"He offered me the wish when I went in. Told me I'd have to wait the<br/>remaining week for it to finish recharging though," Nabiki had a look<br/>of annoyance in her eyes as she would just love that wish. . . even<br/>knowing what wishing led to around Nerima. "He also told me that he<br/>had to move on after that because too many wishes had be granted<br/>here."<p>"What!" Akane snapped her head up finally. "He can't!"<p>Nabiki had to restrain Akane from running out of her room, "Calm<br/>down! The old guy actually told me that whoever made the next wish it<br/>was going to involve Ranma directly. . . most likely to get him back."<p>"But they'll get it wrong!" Akane stated in a panic. "They'll undo<br/>what he wished for too!"<p>"It that what you are worried about? That to get him back the wish<br/>would have to cancel Ranma's wishes?" Nabiki looked a little shocked.<br/>"It's his fault that he made four wishes trying to be cleaver."<p>"You would've tried it too!" Akane spat loudly at her sister. "You<br/>just love to get more than your fair share!"<p>"Whoa! Where'd that come from? First you barely acknowledge the<br/>world, now you're back and shouting at your own family," Nabiki moved<br/>slightly farther back in the rolling desk chair. "But you're right<br/>that I would have tried something simular. . . only I'd have<br/>succeeded."<p>"No, no you wouldn't have," Akane said as all the emotion drained<br/>away again. "One wish. Only one wish."<p>"To get exactly what you wish for," Nabiki nodded. "He told me the<br/>warning too. And Ranma could have simply asked for the curse removed<br/>from the moment he received it. Or that he never got cursed in the<br/>first place. It would have solved so much."<p>"Then we would be dead right now," Akane said softly. "The curse<br/>brought people to train Ranma in more powerful styles. . . it made<br/>him push himself beyond his limits just to prove to himself he was<br/>still a man. Everything revolved around that curse."<p>"Whatever. I don't see it, all I see is the problem that curse<br/>brought him, you, and us," Nabiki narrowed her eyes as she got up to<br/>leave, she wouldn't admit that her little sister was right twice in<br/>one night. Even in her condition. It happened very rarely thankfully,<br/>she must be under too much stress herself to not think of every angle<br/>about Ranma's wish.<p>"I need a wish," Akane said as she put an arm over her eyes to block<br/>out the ceiling light.<p>"You'll have one, I'll make sure of that sis," Nabiki replied softly<br/>as she quietly left the room.<p>- - - -<p>AN: Ranma is referred to as a guy for the most part in this chapter<br/>as that is how everyone is supposed to see her. People have asked for<br/>me to get back to Akane for aftermath and this chapter was prime to<br/>do it as there really could be a dream sequence at the end in this<br/>one.
