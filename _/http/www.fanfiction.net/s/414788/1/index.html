</div>. . . I have no idea from this point on . . .<p>Introduction Chapter<p>By Felix Webster<p>All original Ranma 1/2 Characters and Back story Copyright Rumiko<p>Takahashi, and are used without permission. Please don't sue... cause I<p>have no money.<p>I want to thank the following people for things (like pre reading):<p>Chris Stassen<p>Paul Blay<p>Warning:<p>As with a lot of stories of multiple parts, some of the story maybe<p>dark (though I'll try not to do it too often in this story), and some of<p>it may be Waffy, but mostly I want it the be a fun story.<p>So now you have been warned.<p>Time: Several weeks after the failed wedding.<p>Place: Nerima -the original one (we think)-<p>" " - speech<p>* * - thought<p>( ) - other languages -mostly Chinese -<p>[ ] - Panda signs<p>Ranma combed his recently cut hair. *Aww, why'd mom have to insist on<p>getting my hair cut it was fine the way it was.* He ran his hand down<p>the back and along the length still going down his back. *At least it<p>was only to make it less unruly and not for length; I don't think I<p>could handle short hair.* He cringed at the thought.<p>"Ranma, are you just about done in there?" a voice said in groggy<p>agitation from the other side of the door.<p>"I'll be out in a minute, Nabiki." Ranma combed his hair one last time<p>then set it in a ponytail. *Geez it's way too much maintenance like<p>this.*<p>"You're just as bad as a girl, taking so much time in the bathroom,"<p>Nabiki said as she slid past Ranma when he was leaving causing him to<p>cringe slightly.<p>"At least I have a reason to take so long in there," Ranma replied,<p>sticking his tongue out at her.<p>Nabiki smirked at him. "That one will cost you, Saotome." She chuckled<p>as she started to brush her teeth then stopped when she saw her watch.<p>"What am I doing up at this unnatural hour!"<p>Akane stood patiently by the front door already dressed for school,<p>though she didn't look happy about being up so early. "Ranma, are you<p>ready? It was your idea to get up at this time." She asked when she saw<p>Ranma approach. "Why are we going so early anyway?"<p>"Yeah, I'm ready." Ranma said coming to a halt in front of Akane. "I<p>want to check on something before school."<p>Akane's heart threatened to stop at seeing Ranma. He was dressed for<p>school, wearing the traditional school uniform and his hair was neatly<p>pulled back. *He looks sooo good in a uniform. The dark colour and<p>sharp edges makes him seem stronger.*<p>Ranma noticed her expression and got concerned about it. "Is<p>everything all right Akane?"<p>Akane snapped out of her stunned state. "I... I liked your hair better<p>when it was wild . . . " she started. "But I like the ponytail more."<p>She smiled as she grabbed his hand and led him out the main gate.<p>"It's my mother's idea. She figures that the wild hair and the unusual<p>clothes are some of the hindrances for me settling down." Ranma said<p>with a frown. "Of course, having two fiancees, a crazy Chinese girl who<p>thinks I'm her husband, and a psycho chick who wants to date and do<p>other horrible things to me, isn't a bit of a hindrance at all." Ranma<p>looked to the sky. "And that isn't even listing my problems as a girl!"<p>"At least you've reduced it to only two fiancees, you used to say<p>three," Akane pointed out plainly, then under her breath she added.<p>"It's still one too many."<p>Ranma smiled to himself having heard the mumbled addition from Akane,<p>then took the lead, "Yeah, well today I'm going to change all that!"<p>and he started to walk toward the market area of town.<p>-<p>A short time later, the two were standing in front of a very<p>disturbing little store in an area of the market area not usually<p>visited. Akane looked around nervously. "Ranma, I don't like the looks<p>of this place," she said as she squeezed his hand.<p>Ranma tried to look strong but he was just as nervous. "Don't worry,<p>Akane, there's nothing dangerous here."<p>Akane felt reassured even though she didn't believe him. "Um . . .<p>where did you hear of this place?" she said as Ranma led her inside.<p>"Gosunkugi came here last week and I sort of followed him, to see what<p>he was up to," Ranma replied while looking over the stuff around him,<p>thankful that he didn't know what most of it was.<p>"Wait, hasn't he been missing for about a week Ranma?" Akane asked<p>with concern. She may not like the guy, but people disappearing usually<p>caused problems for her family in some way.<p>"How could you tell?" Ranma asked, though his thoughts were of<p>watching Gosunkugi in this store last week.<p>"No new nails in the trees at school," Akane answered with a grin and<p>they both laughed.<p>"Hello, good sir," said a person coming out of a shadow near the pair<p>which made both of them jump.<p>"Geez, DON'T do that!" Ranma said while trying to catch his breath.<p>"A thousand pardons, good sir, I did not mean to scare." Said the old<p>man who replaced the shadow, looking very pleasant.<p>"Yeah, well, you did the same thing last week!" Ranma replied, then<p>got a look in his eyes that Akane couldn't describe. "Is it charged<p>yet?"<p>The old man looked Ranma over then smiled. "Ah, you've come for the<p>Stone of Fate have you."<p>"Yeah, yeah, cut the Yoda routine. Is it ready yet?" Ranma started to<p>lose his patience.<p>"What is the stone of fate?" Akane asked, getting worried over the way<p>Ranma sounded.<p>"The Stone of Fate is a wishing font. Anything you want can be wished<p>for and gained, as long as you make the right wish, of course."<p>Explained the old man with a disturbing smile.<p>Akane looked at Ranma in shock. "What! Are you just going to try and<p>wish your troubles away?" She decided that she had a right to be<p>worried now, knowing that this stuff never worked the way you'd want.<p>Ranma just smiled at Akane. "No, that would probably just send them a<p>few blocks away and then they would come back real angry. I've learned<p>my lessons about that one before."<p>"So what are you planing on wishing for, your curse gone?" Akane was<p>actually a little disappointed at this possibility, though she knew it<p>was what Ranma really wanted. She'd never admit it she liked his female<p>side. It was a part of him and separate at the same time, and made him<p>whole.<p>Ranma smiled at Akane in a lopsided way. "Well sorta, you'll just have<p>to wait and see."<p>The old shopkeeper smiled at the two, then motioned them toward the<p>back. "Come along, young ones, the Stone grows eager to grant its<p>wish." And the three moved into the back room.<p>-<p>The room was impressive, with rugs of very artistic designs hanging on<p>all the walls, pillows of colourful patterns were everywhere on the<p>floor, and in the middle of the room was a small wooden table. The<p>table was highly artistic with carvings all along its legs, and in the<p>centre of the table was a blue and red stone in a yin yang pattern<p>under a glass covering.<p>Ranma was looking at the room as if for the first time. "Hey, this<p>room didn't look like this last time," Ranma exclaimed then noticed the<p>stone. "And the stone was sliver . . . "<p>The old man just kept his smile. "The Stone reflects the person who is<p>going to make a wish from it," he explained then looked at Akane and<p>nodded toward her. "As for the room, that is your pretty companion's<p>fault."<p>Akane started getting angry, being accused of something which couldn't<p>be her fault. "What do you mean it's my fault!" She of course totally<p>missed the compliment.<p>"The room looks arabic cause you, my dear, expect it to." The old man<p>winked at Akane as he explained, totally unfazed by her anger. "The<p>other boy was expecting something more in the way of Voodoo style and<p>the room accommodated him."<p>"Well, I like it better this way. It's a lot better than last time."<p>Ranma shivered at the memory then noticed one of the designs on a rug.<p>"Hey this is my fight with Saffron!" he exclaimed as he moved closer to<p>it.<p>"What?" Akane moved over beside Ranma to get a look at the rug.<p>"You're right, Ranma . . . and look over at this one . . . It's of<p>you holding me after the fight." Akane pointed to the next rug with a<p>bit of shock.<p>The old man peered at the rugs then at the two youngsters in his<p>store. "Hmm, so you're the one who defeated Saffron are you . . .<p>interesting. No wonder the Stone is so eager to grant you a wish." The<p>old man then went over to the table and lifted the glass off of the<p>stone. "Well, sir, come over here and take the Stone into your right<p>hand."<p>Ranma suddenly remembered why he was there and complied with the old<p>man. When the stone was in Ranma's hand the old man started to explain<p>how to use it. "Now, sir, before you wish you should know that the<p>Stone can grant a large number of wishes at once. But, the more wishes<p>it has to grant, the less likely of you getting exactly what you wished<p>for." The old man tried his best to sound ominous. "Do you understand,<p>sir?"<p>Ranma quickly nodded obviously not listening, but Akane decided she<p>needed clarification. "So, you mean if he makes only one wish, he'll<p>get what he expects the wish to grant . . . but the more wishes, the<p>more random the result?"<p>"Yes, exactly, young lady!" The old man was happy someone here figured<p>it out, then he turned to Ranma. "You've got a smart girl there . . .<p>I can't figure what you would need a wish for with someone like that in<p>you life, but to each his own. Be careful of your words."<p>Ranma looked at Akane and smiled weakly. "Well, here goes . . . I<p>wish myself and Akane could start our relationship all over again<p>without my Nyanniichuan curse, or the problems caused by all my<p>fiancees and the other misunderstandings we've had." His voice seemed<p>to echo in the small room as he spoke his wish.<p>Ranma felt proud of himself at his cleverness getting that all in.<p>"There, that should do it."<p>The old man just looked down shaking his head slowly, then looked back<p>up at the boy. "Sorry, sir, but that was four wishes not one."<p>"Um . . . Let me try again, ok?" Ranma asked as he started to feel<p>weird.<p>"Unfortunately the wishes have already been granted," the old man said<p>in apology as Ranma started to fade out of existence.<p>Akane was frantic, seeing Ranma fading away. "What's happening to<p>Ranma!" She grabbed the old man's shirt as Ranma disappeared<p>completely.<p>The old man calmly pulled Akane's hands off himself. "He's gone to the<p>world which matches his wish," he replied as he smoothed out his shirt.<p>Akane looked stunned for a moment, then both started to cry and got<p>angry at the same time. "Bring him back!" She screamed as she started<p>pounding on the old man's chest in a fit.<p>The old man caught her hands and calmly spoke to her. "Come back in<p>one months time and the Stone will have recharged by then. You can wish<p>him back at that time . . . if you truly want to."<p>"A month! Why a month!" Akane said in panic. "It took only a week<p>to recharge after Gosunkugi used it!"<p>The old man took the girl's hysterics in stride and simply said, "The<p>other boy only made one wish, and he is living the life he wanted." He<p>looked to the flat grey stone which now laid of the floor. "Your friend<p>made four wishes so it will take four times as long to recharge."<p>Akane fell to her knees crying full out. "A month . . . what am I<p>going do?" she said in a small voice then suddenly her face showed a<p>lot of fear. "What am I going to tell the others!"
