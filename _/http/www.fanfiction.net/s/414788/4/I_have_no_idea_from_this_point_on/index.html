</div>...I have no idea from this point on...<br/>[ IHNIFTPO ]<p>Ranma's Wish, Chapter 3<br/>By Felix Webster ( Felix Warstar )<br/>[felix_]<p>All original Ranma ½ Characters Copyright Rumiko Takahashi (first<br/>published by Shogakugan in Japan and brought over to North America by<br/>Viz Communications), and are used without permission. Please don't<br/>sue... cause I have no money.<p>" " - speech<br/>* * - thoughts<br/>( ) - other languages - Chinese mostly -<br/>[ ] - Panda signs<p>- Pajama Party -<p>"Sorry it couldn't be longer..." Ranma-chan murmured as she turned<br/>on her side away from Akane. Slowly opening her eyes she sat up<br/>putting a hand on her forehead as she yawned, *Man, I'm having some<br/>really weird dreams.*<p>Looking over at her sleeping friend made Ranma-chan smile to<br/>herself, "But if I have something like that to wake up to I think I<br/>can handle weird dreams."<p>Getting up she dressed quickly into her Gi and left as quietly as<br/>she could. She headed towards the Dojo shaking her head, "I'm really<br/>going to hate getting my own bed."<p>Thinking back to why she and her father were even really there made<br/>the smile go away. She still wasn't sure that hiding from her mother<br/>was a completely wise idea, but it would keep her father alive<br/>longer. Sliding open the Dojo door she was surprised to find her<br/>father sitting in the middle of the floor wearing his suit and<br/>meditating.<p>"What's up Pop? You aren't warming up?"<p>"Ranma... We won't be sparring today," Genma opened his still red<br/>and bleary eyes. It was obvious that he hadn't completely gotten over<br/>the drinking from the night before.<p>Ranma-chan moved over and started to check her father's scalp, "Got<br/>too strong of a hangover huh?"<p>Genma shook off his daughter's examination and winced from moving<br/>too fast, "The hangover is besides the point girl!"<p>"Sure," Ranma-chan replied giving her father a small kiss on his<br/>forehead, "So what's the problem then?"<p>"Soun has reminded me of my duty to my family," Genma stated<br/>solemnly. He looked beaten mentally, "I will be going home to explain<br/>our new problem to your mother today."<p>"I thought we both agreed that going home would be too dangerous<br/>until we find cures!" Ranma-chan looked worried for her father's<br/>safety.<p>"Yes we did, but it would be dishonourable of me to hide like that,"<br/>Genma continued putting a hand up to stall his daughter's rebuke.<br/>"Besides, my sabbatical time is up soon and I have a job to get back<br/>to."<p>"You have never given more than lip service to honour, unless mother<br/>says something about it," Ranma-chan replied through gritted teeth.<br/>She had just gotten here, just made a real friend, how could he do<br/>this to her!<p>"I've tried to be a good example for you, at least in the last few<br/>years. . ." Genma looked wounded at Ranma-chan's stab at his honour.<p>"Pop, when we're on the road I know you do what you have to for us<br/>to survive. And you've been very honourable in the last little while,<br/>but. . . THIS COULD GET YOU KILLED!"<p>"She won't kill me... Both me and Soun hope the panda curse will be<br/>considered penance by her for your curse," Genma said calmly as he<br/>put an arm around his daughter who was hugging him in fear of losing<br/>him.<p>Ranma-chan snapped her head up in shock, "But it wasn't your fault!<br/>I knocked you into the springs first."<p>"And I should have noticed the change before letting you anywhere<br/>near me to fall into another spring," Genma replied back sadly.<p>"I should have taken the warning in the guild book seriously!"<p>"We both should have, but we didn't believe in magical curses,"<br/>Genma corrected her, "And after what my master put me through I<br/>should have known better."<p>Ranma-chan snuggled into her father's embrace still very scared for<br/>him, "We're doing it again. We keep trying to blame ourselves for<br/>fate's actions."<p>"Fate only guides you to the moment of decision, from there what you<br/>do is your own choice. Fate is not to blame for our decisions or<br/>mistakes," Genma said softly," Our being cursed is our own fault for<br/>disregarding all the warnings put before us."<p>"I guess... but I have a weird feeling that things like this has<br/>happened to us before, and will again many times."<p>"Nothing like this has happened to me before," Genma replied giving<br/>his daughter a confused look, "Were you changing into a boy before<br/>this and didn't tell me?"<p>"Of course not!" Ranma-chan said with a giggle as she baby punched<br/>her father's cheek, "That's why it's weird."<p>-<p>Nabiki laid awake having heard their guest get up awhile ago. She<br/>wasn't a morning person by any means but she had things on her mind<br/>since last night. Also Ranma-chan's father was a very noisy person in<br/>the morning and Nabiki didn't expect to get any more sleep if they<br/>started sparring.<p>After a few minutes of quiet she got up in confusion, she padded her<br/>way downstairs to see what was going on. In the livingroom she heard<br/>loud talking coming from the Dojo so she moved quickly worried that<br/>Ranma-chan and the girls's father were having an argument.<p>Nearing the Dojo she changed to a more sneaking movement as she<br/>peeked in. All she saw was Ranma-chan and Genma sitting on the floor<br/>hugging each other. Moving away from the door she could only envy the<br/>girl, she couldn't remember the last time her father had done that<br/>with her.<p>-<p>Ranma-chan finally found her center again and pushed lightly away<br/>from her father, "Okay I guess, I'll go get packed."<p>Genma chuckled softly as he looked at the depressed look on his<br/>daughters face at doing that, "You're not coming."<p>"What?"<p>"You are already enrolled in the local school and have made friends<br/>if I heard right about you and Akane having a sleep over tonight,"<br/>Genma tried to look serious but ended up smiling. "Your mother and I<br/>had planned to put you back into a regular school this year, and we<br/>even considered this one. You are staying with the Tendo's."<p>"Wait a second! You two planned to send me to this school<br/>anyways!" Ranma-chan said in shock as she bolted upright.<p>"It was one option..."<p>"YOU WERE NEVER PLANNING TO HIDE! You knew mother would come here<br/>sooner or later just to check when we didn't come home!"<p>"It's not like that," Genma replied nervously waving his hands out<br/>in front of himself. "I figured I would have several months to come<br/>up with something or find a cure before she checked here."<p>"Idiot!" Ranma-chan bopped him on the head and stormed out of the<br/>Dojo.<p>Genma gave a small smile to the leaving form of his daughter, "Just<br/>like her mother."<p>-<p>Ranma-chan wasn't really that angry at her father, but he could have<br/>told her instead of letting her get scared for their lives. She may<br/>not have gotten along with her mother very much in the past few<br/>years, but not seeing her again for a long time was something she<br/>didn't like about the plan to hide. Now she finds out that wasn't<br/>going to be the situation and they really weren't hiding.<p>Walking into the livingroom Ranma-chan flopped herself onto the<br/>Tendo's sofa near the TV. Looking over at Nabiki, who repositioned<br/>herself after being rudely bounced. Ranma-chan smiled at the older<br/>girl, "So you're a morning person too?"<p>"No," Nabiki replied annoyed.<p>"So why are you awake?"<p>"Because some son of a. . . panda is very loud when he gets up,"<br/>Nabiki frowned as Ranma-chan continued to smile at her.<p>"Don't worry about that, Pop's going home today."<p>"What? Are you going too?" Nabiki asked seriously.<p>"Why, Don't want me here?" Ranma-chan countered lifting an eyebrow.<p>"It's not that," Nabiki replied quickly.<p>"Don't worry, I'm staying. I'm already enrolled here and I can't<br/>really go back to my old school."<p>"Oh good. . . Akane will be happy about that," Nabiki leaned back<br/>into the sofa. "Listen... I've got to talk to you about something,<br/>but I really don't like giving away information for free."<p>"And if I refuse to pay?" Ranma-chan asked as she also leaned back<br/>into the comfort of the sofa. The smells from the kitchen making her<br/>hungry.<p>"It's important."<p>"Then I'll find out about it when it comes up. I don't listen to<br/>rumours much anyways." Ranma-chan said seriously but smirked.<p>Nabiki shook her head, she was way too tired to put up a good<br/>offensive and she wanted the girl to know, "Fine. I think... No, I<br/>know Kuno has become fixated with you."<p>"Akane warned me that he got like that with her when she beat him,"<br/>Ranma-chan replied shaking her head. "So is he giving up on Akane now?"<p>"I don't think so. His twisted little mind can't make those kind of<br/>decisions very easily," Nabiki sounded very frosty.<p>"So he's going to continue chasing a girl who doesn't like him, and<br/>start chasing a girl who can't like him that way," Ranma-chan frowned<br/>not liking the idea. "And he doesn't seem to like me much as a guy<br/>either."<p>"About that... How much do you plan to tell him?" Nabiki asked<br/>trying not to look at the girl.<p>"How much have you already sold him?" Ranma-chan countered with a<br/>smirk.<p>"Moi?" Nabiki asked in faux shock then narrowed her gaze at the red<br/>head. "How'd you know?"<p>"Every school has a people like you, Nabiki. They'd probably fall<br/>apart with out at least one," Ranma-chan chuckled as she explained.<br/>"Some of them can be real scum."<p>"I haven't sold him any info yet," Nabiki crossed her arms looking<br/>annoyed. " I didn't feel comfortable about doing that without talking<br/>to you first for some reason... and that bothers me a lot."<p>"Huh, don't know why it should," Ranma-chan replied with a shrug.<br/>"Tell him what you feel comfortable with, but if you make any money<br/>off me I want a share."<p>Nabiki blinked at the girl in disbelief. Once again she was thrown<br/>off guard by the red head.<p>"I'll let you know when you go too far," Ranma-chan gave Nabiki an<br/>evil smile. "You don't want to go too far."<p>"I'm sure," Nabiki knew a threat when she heard one, but threats<br/>made her go into ice queen mode not scare her.<p>"So... What are we going to do with Kuno and the 'Morning Maniacs'?"<br/>Ranma-chan asked turning serious.<p>"Huh? What about them?" Nabiki replied trying to look innocent.<p>"I'm pretty sure you had a hand in encouraging Kuno so I want your<br/>help getting him out of Akane's life," Ranma-chan stated firmly.<p>"I had nothing to do with that idiotic speech," Nabiki turned away<br/>from the other girl's angry eyes. She was waking up more but not<br/>enough the counter with her own nasty gaze. "I only suggested that if<br/>he could beat her in 'honourable' combat she MIGHT agree to go out<br/>with him."<p>"Knowing full well that he couldn't bring himself to go all out<br/>against a girl," the smirk came back to Ranma-chan's face.<p>"Figured that out already, huh?"<p>"I'm only a little slower as a boy but I had a much harder time<br/>against him yesterday after school," Ranma-chan turned serious again.<p>"I didn't count on how truly twisted Kuno's mind had become. He's<br/>not always been so loopy... It must have been a really bad day for<br/>his dementia," Nabiki replied sadly. "On his good days he can even be<br/>charming."<p>"You liked him didn't you?"<p>Nabiki looked at the floor and sighed, it was way too early for this<br/>kinda stuff... but she felt she needed to open up, at least once in<br/>her life. "What's not to like, at least at a distance. He's handsome,<br/>rich, and easy to manipulate. In our first year he wasn't so bad with<br/>his dementia, but it's been going from bad to worse... And he won't<br/>even get help."<p>"His getting worse is a very good reason to get him off his Akane<br/>fixation. Before he loses it and decides to hurt Akane," Ranma-chan's<br/>anger and concern were obvious even though her voice was as ice.<p>"I guess..."<p>"Don't guess! I know I can handle Kuno when he's full out, I might<br/>get some bruises but he's no real threat to me. Akane isn't ready yet."<p>"Problem is he needs to fixate on someone or else the whole school<br/>is in danger," Nabiki replied very seriously.<p>"Why don't you take him on? You seem to be able to deal with him<br/>already."<p>"Won't work," Nabiki looked angry but the sadness was obvious in her<br/>eyes. "He considers me a 'Fallen Woman'."<p>"What! Why would that twisted little..." Ranma asked as a soft glow<br/>surrounded her barely visible. After a few seconds it died down as<br/>she calmed herself," Why would he think that?"<p>"Last year he tried coming on to me. He was very sweet about it too,<br/>and unlike the other girls I responded in kind," Nabiki leaned back<br/>again and stared at the ceiling taking careful measure to restrain<br/>her emotions. "I should have known better... He had one of his worst<br/>episodes while we were on a date. I suggested something and he<br/>started accusing me of being a lot of very nasty things."<p>"That little bastard!" The glow was back and getting brighter.<p>"He snubbed me at school after that. He really doesn't remember what<br/>truly happened so his mind filled in the blanks to fit what he<br/>couldn't recall," Nabiki clenched her fist, then relaxed again. "He<br/>only started to even talk to me again when I became his best avenue<br/>to his new fixation. . . so I started gouging him in his pocket book."<p>"Well, we have to get him fixated on someone else."<p>"He already is. . . unfortunately it's you."<p>"And he still says he's in love with Akane. . ." Ranma-chan twisted<br/>her lip in annoyance, ". . . Stupid little bastard."<p>-<p>Kasumi moved away from the entrance of the kitchen with a smile on<br/>her lips. There was hope for her middle sister after all.<p>-<p>Breakfast was nothing like the morning before. Both Genma and his<br/>daughter ate at a normal pace with no speed or fight. Nabiki sat<br/>quietly and barely touched her food, she looked lost in thought.<br/>Kasumi seemed happier than usual and that was hard to do. Akane<br/>watched both guests and wondered if things would really be alright as<br/>Uncle Saotome said they would be.<p>Finishing Akane looked at her friend and motioned Ranma-chan to<br/>finish quickly. Ranma-chan put down her chopsticks and stood up. She<br/>was dressed in another Chinese shirt and pants combo that Akane<br/>couldn't help but wonder how the girl was going to get away with at<br/>school again. "I'm done."<p>"Um okay, lets go. I don't want to be late today," Akane pulled<br/>Ranma-chan out the door.<p>As soon as they came to the chain link fence Ranma-chan hopped up<br/>and started her balance practice, her mind seemed elsewhere. Nabiki<br/>took a few minutes to catch up with them which earned her a raised<br/>eyebrow from Akane. The three continued on their way quietly.<p>As the school gates came into sight Akane sprinted forward not<br/>noticing Ranma-chan leave the fence and follow right behind her. The<br/>boys came into the open and both girls started attacking them.<p>Akane started to notice that the idiots weren't putting up the same<br/>level of offensive that they normally did in the morning. Taking a<br/>moment to look over the battlefield she saw a red blur knocking<br/>several of the boys out of action causing Akane to get angry.<p>"RANMA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!" Akane screamed at the girl as she<br/>slammed the back of her hand into one of the boy's face.<p>"I missed sparring with Pop this morning, I figured I could get a<br/>workout here," Ranma-chan ducked a hockey stick as she smiled back at<br/>Akane.<p>"This is MY FIGHT!"<p>"I know that. But you said you hated this so I'm cutting down the<br/>problem," Ranma-chan moved her foot up quickly and slammed it into<br/>another boy's jaw.<p>Akane stood in the center of the bodies laying everywhere and looked<br/>at her friend in anger, "I can't believe that you don't think I can<br/>handle them! I've been..."<p>Ranma-chan simply put two fingers over Akane's lips and talked as<br/>calmly as she could, "I know you can handle them, I've watched you do<br/>it, but you shouldn't have to do it alone. Friends help each other."<p>Akane's anger drained out as she looked into the serious blue eyes<br/>of her friend. She was about to apologize when Ranma-chan blurred<br/>again.<p>Standing two feet over and blocking Akane from the main stairs Ranma-<br/>chan grabbed the projectile she had seen coming. Once again it was a<br/>rose...<p>"What's with that stupid stick boy!" she asked the heavens and was<br/>answered by a roll of thunder. "You don't know either huh?"<p>"As the sky will open up to cleanse this field of fools, who thought<br/>to win either of the hearts of two beautiful flowers, so will the<br/>heavens open up to shine on the goddesses before mine eyes."<p>"What are you going on about this time?" Ranma-chan asked as she put<br/>the rose into her school bag carefully.<p>Nabiki had been whispering to her sister during this time causing<br/>Akane's eyes to wide. Akane moved up beside Ranma-chan and tried to<br/>explain, "Ranma... according to Nabiki's 'friends' Kuno has extended<br/>his proclamation to include you in the morning battles."<p>Ranma-chan blinked at Akane, "You mean these idiots thought they<br/>could date me if..."<p>"If they could best you in honourable combat my fiery tigress," Kuno<br/>finished with an arrogant smile.<p>Ranma-chan spun on her heels to face the kendoist again, she<br/>scrunched up her face and drew in a large breath, "You idiot! I'm a<br/>LESBIAN!"<p>"I'd be more likely to date Mrs. Shouki in Home Ec. than some<br/>idiotic testosterone driven boy!" Ranma-chan screamed directly into<br/>Kuno's face. This of course caused several reactions including an<br/>overweight middle-aged woman trying desperately to remind her co-<br/>workers that she was a happily married heterosexual woman by showing<br/>her wedding band and pictures of their two kids.<p>It also caused several people to think they had conformation about<br/>Akane as the two seemed such good friends. These people showed their<br/>thoughts in some very wicked smiles.<p>Nabiki and Akane simply slapped their foreheads.<p>"Nay, I say nay! It is but a ruse. One to make a suitor work all<br/>that much harder to win the heart of such a dream!" Kuno said shaking<br/>his head. He moved his bokken forward and stood in a ready position.<br/>"Let it be known that Tatewaki Kuno accepts this challenge and any<br/>others, whether they be man or woman; physical or spiritual to win<br/>your love!"<p>Lightning flashed, thunder rolled and everyone moved for cover<br/>including the two girls who were the center of attention. All but<br/>Kuno, still in his grand pose of a true warrior, got inside before<br/>the rain came.<p>-<p>The rest of the day was spent either fending off questions, hitting<br/>people for making rude comments, or apologizing to Home Ec. teachers.<p>Lunch was quiet as Nabiki threatened to raise everyone's interest<br/>rates if they bothered either girl.<p>Last period finished as Akane almost had to drag Ranma-chan out of<br/>the school to meet up with Yuka and Sayuri at the front gates.<p>"So was that the big secret?" Yuka asked with a smile.<p>"Ah no, I don't bother to keep that a secret." Ranma-chan replied<br/>waving off the question.<p>"Oh okay," Yuka said then turned to Akane, "We'll be at your place<br/>by six, okay?"<p>"Sounds good," Akane waved as her friends walked off to their homes.<br/>"See, you have a couple hours reprieve."<p>"And then freakdom," Ranma-chan replied as she leaned against the<br/>school wall with a heavy thud. Two crows which were taking advantage<br/>of a small pool burst into flight in fright and spread water<br/>everywhere.<p>Ranma-kun looked down at his wet form then up at the retreating<br/>crows and sighed in defeat as Akane giggled.<p>Akane grabbed his hand to pull him away from the wall and head home,<br/>but she pulled to hard and Ranma-kun had to use her as a brace as he<br/>came forward too fast.<p>"Get. Your. Hands. Off. Akane Tendo!"<p>Both Akane and Ranma-kun groaned loudly.<p>"I can not believe that you would try to push yourself on her two<br/>days in a row! I thought I taught you the error of your ways<br/>yesterday!" Kuno stood in a ready pose as he yelled at the other boy.<p>"Upperclassman Kuno, who I spent time with is my choice so please<br/>mind your own business," Akane said as she moved slightly away from<br/>Ranma-kun and blushed.<p>"I will not have this villain lay his filthy hands on such a pure<br/>vision of beauty," Kuno cried out indigently ignoring Akane's<br/>request. "I challenge you to fair combat!"<p>"Again?" Ranma-kun dusted himself off as he stood up from the<br/>sitting position Akane's moving away from him had out him into.<br/>"You'd think one beating would be enough?"<p>"Yes one would cur!" Kuno agreed obviously believing that he was the<br/>one who gave the beating and the recipient of it.<p>"Ranma, we don't have the time. We have to get the house ready for<br/>tonight," Akane said trying to pull Ranma-kun away from another fight.<p>"What's to get ready?" Ranma-kun asked then an evil smile came to<br/>his mouth. "Oh yeah, my futon's going to be there today so I don't<br/>have to sleep in your bed all the time."<p>Akane stopped moving out of shock then she spun around in anger, "I<br/>thought you liked sleeping in my bed!"<p>It took less then a second to realize her mistake as everyone nearby<br/>dropped from being earthshattering stunned, "I. . I. . I didn't mean<br/>it that way!"<p>"YOU HAVE SULLIED THE BODY OF AKANE TENDO!" Kuno screamed as he<br/>moved at almost blinding speed towards Ranma-kun with his bokken<br/>swinging like a wild man.<p>Ranma-kun barely ducked the straight cut Kuno started with then had<br/>to start dodging at full speed wishing he was a girl at the moment<br/>for the extra speed, "She isn't Sullied! We haven't done anything!"<p>Kuno redoubled his attack as he swung at Ranma-kun time and time<br/>again with out showing signs of tiring anytime soon. He hit once to<br/>Ranma-kun's side while the boy dodging by turning around the pervious<br/>attack and this caused the boy to double over for a moment giving<br/>Kuno a good shot to Ranma-kun's neck. Ranma-kun caught the blade with<br/>one hand as he twisted to face Kuno, both eyes blazed in fury and a<br/>glow formed over him. Yanking the bokken out of Kuno's stunned hands<br/>Ranma-kun broke the wooden blade by twisting his fingers and glared a<br/>the kendoist with the power found there, "I would never hurt Akane.<br/>And I will not see others try to either!"<p>Kuno stared into those eyes and stepped back slightly as fear came<br/>to him for a brief moment. The voice was not the boy's. . . it was<br/>too deep to be that of the boy coming into puberty as this boy,<br/>muscular and handsome as he was already, was going through. The voice<br/>held a boldness of power that he hadn't seen before in Ranma-kun.<p>Ranma-kun stood in a full stance as he glared at the taller boy and<br/>then moved in a blur towards Kuno screaming, "Moko Takabisha!"<p>Everyone watching the fight only saw a sudden blight flash and then<br/>the sight of Kuno flying in a straight line until the school building<br/>stopped his path and then he almost went through that. Akane turned<br/>towards the standing form of Ranma-kun whose glow was dimming fast<br/>and the energy in his eyes blinking away. She had to run up and catch<br/>the falling boy who looked like he had wiped himself with that move.<p>- - - -<p>Holding Ranma-chan's head in her lap Akane and Nabiki looked worried<br/>at the still unconscious girl as they sat on Akane's bed. It had been<br/>almost an hour since the fight, it took almost that time to get Ranma-<br/>kun home with the help of Nabiki. They tried Dr. Tofu first but he<br/>was out somewhere and a plate of cookies sat on one of his tables so<br/>they quickly headed for home. Once there Kasumi made them change him<br/>back into a girl then started to get something started downstairs<br/>that was supposed to help get the girl's energy back up to safe levels.<p>"Why hasn't she woken up yet?" Akane asked again for about the tenth<br/>time as she gave Nabiki a worried look.<p>"I don't know," Nabiki replied in annoyance giving her sister a cold<br/>look trying to hide her worry. "I didn't know the last time you<br/>asked, or the times before that."<p>"She is drained of her energy," Kasumi said calmly as she came in<br/>with a steaming cup. "Lift her head and I'll make her drink this."<p>Akane complied quicky moving Ranma-chan into more of a sitting<br/>position and watched nervously as Kasumi put the cup to Ranma-chan's<br/>lips. Ranma-chan drank at the liquid as a hunger cub would from a<br/>mother wolf then seemed to relax more in a comfort way instead of an<br/>unconscious state, "I don't understand. . ."<p>"What ever Ranma did she wasn't ready to do it. She could have<br/>killed herself if she was even slightly more tired," Kasumi replied<br/>as she moved a blanket over the lower half of the red headed girl.<br/>"Father taught me a recipe to make a sort of energy drink if he ever<br/>got into a simular way defending us. He seems to know a few<br/>techniques that might put him like this."<p>Before Akane to ask more about what her Dad could possibly know that<br/>would cause something like this when Ranma-chan slowly opened her<br/>eyes and moaned. Turning her attention to the girl Akane gave her an<br/>angry look, "What the hell was that move you used! It nearly killed<br/>you!"<p>"W. . What are you talking about?" Ranma-chan asked weakly not<br/>understanding what was going on. "How did Kuno beat me?"<p>"Kuno didn't beat you, you sent him across the school yard and into<br/>the building hard enough that it shook the whole place," Nabiki<br/>replied snidely. "Then you fell down and almost died according to<br/>Kasumi."<p>"How'd I beat him?" Ranma-chan looked very confused and ready to<br/>sleep again.<p>"You started to glow and then ran at him and then a bright blue<br/>light exploded around you causing Kuno to fly," Akane said still<br/>looking worried.<p>"Oh. . . okay," Ranma-chan replied as she slipped back into sleep.<p>"She'll sleep about an hour but she will be weak for awhile after,"<br/>Kasumi stated as both younger sisters look at her in concern then she<br/>walked out of the room.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma-chan lifted her head a time later and blinked the sleep out of<br/>her eyes. She didn't have the feeling of waking from an important<br/>dream this time. . . if fact she didn't think she dreamed at all. She<br/>was more tired then she could remember being for a long long time but<br/>it was only in her body and not her mind so more sleep was out of the<br/>question.<p>The room was dark and quiet so she slowly moved herself off Akane's<br/>bed and started to walk for the door only to bump into a large wooden<br/>object near the door. Rubbing her knee slightly she almost cursed the<br/>sight of her new Futon waiting to be used, she just wasn't mentally<br/>tired and she wished she was, "Damn, I guess I'm at the Tendo's."<p>Slowly making her way down stairs she walked to the hallway opening<br/>into the livingroom-diningroom area and had to use the frame to hold<br/>herself up, "Um. . Kasumi, could I have something to eat?"<p>Kasumi looked up from her tea and nodded without her usual smile<br/>before getting up and walking into the kitchen. Nabiki sat in her<br/>spot at the table and eyed the red haired girl in concern, "Are you<br/>feeling better?"<p>"Not really, but thanks for the concern," Ranma-chan sat into her<br/>seat with a thud as she couldn't control her decent. Trying to ignore<br/>her condition she looked around not seeing her friend, "Where's Akane?"<p>"She's meeting her friends halfway to tell them about what<br/>happened," Kasumi replied as she came back into the room carrying a<br/>small plate with a bowl on it. Placing it in front of Ranma-chan she<br/>gave the girl a serious look, "Now eat this all. It'll taste horrible<br/>but it's the next thing you need to rebuild your energy."<p>"Great. . ." Ranma-chan sighed as she started to sip the soup then<br/>cringed before continuing. "Tastes familiar. . . only a little better<br/>then what Pop makes."<p>"I guess Daddy learned it from the same person that Uncle Saotome<br/>did," Nabiki replied sniffing the steam then recoiled as if<br/>confronting a skunk. "Who ever it was cooks like Akane."<p>"We're home!" came from the outer door as the sound of several<br/>people came into the house.<p>"Speak of an Oni and. . ." Nabiki started rolling her eyes slightly<br/>at the laughter coming from the outer room.<p>". . . And, Poof, three shall appear," Ranma-chan finished with a<br/>weak smile as she put done the bowl.<p>"Ranma, you're up finally!" Akane said as she lead Yuka and Sayuri<br/>into the livingroom, the smile on her face was a little strained.<br/>"Are you feeling better?"<p>"A little," Ranma-chan shrugged slightly then mentally cursed how<br/>tired she was again.<p>"Good," Akane replied with a grin. "Don't worry about tonight. . .<br/>we decided on videos for our fun."<p>"Yeah, Akane said that you weren't feeling very well," Sayuri said<br/>as she kneeled down beside the red haired girl. "I hope tonight isn't<br/>going to be a problem with you."<p>"Nah, I'm awake but my body is a little out of it right now," Ranma-<br/>chan smiled weakly at Sayuri then turned to look at Akane. "So,<br/>whatcha get? Hopefully it isn't those awful romance movies."<p>"See, I told you that she wouldn't like those," Yuka playfully<br/>punched Akane in the shoulder.<p>"We have one romance movie," Akane replied giving Ranma-chan a<br/>challenging look, "it's an english movie called 'Princess Bride', and<br/>we have several action movies."<p>"Sounds good," Ranma-chan slowly got up then was helped by Sayuri to<br/>the sofa. Turning her head towards Nabiki who was setting up to leave<br/>she smiled, "You going to join us or not?"<p>"Moi? I don't think I'd be welcome," Nabiki replied without looking<br/>at the group.<p>"I don't think anyone would really mind. . . unless they owe you<br/>money?" Ranma-chan looked at both new girls raising her eyebrows<br/>waiting for some support.<p>"I don't mind," Sayuri said with a shrug. "The more the merrier."<p>Yuka and Akane looked at each other and then both shrugged before<br/>Akane looked at her older sister, "Want to join us Nabiki?"<p>"I'm not really into action films. . . but why not," Nabiki replied<br/>a little surprised.<p>"Good, we'll get Kasumi out here too when we play that romance<br/>movie. . . I'm sure she'll enjoy the break from making us snacks all<br/>night long," Ranma-chan smiled as she patted the stop next to her for<br/>Nabiki to sit so she couldn't choose a seat secluded from the others.<p>"I've got some snacks," Yuka offered up the bag she was carrying as<br/>she chose a spot on the floor in front of the sofa. "Mom always says<br/>to never visit empty handed."<p>"Great, so what's first?" Ranma-chan asked as Akane pulled out<br/>several video tapes.<p>- - - -<p>Several hours later Kasumi had left a large tray of snacks and had<br/>gone off to bed after thanking Ranma-chan for insisting she watch the<br/>movie, she expected to dream of handsome men going to great lengths<br/>for her love and she had to hide the blush until well out of sight.<br/>Nabiki was discussing the way that her old, and the four younger<br/>girl's new, history teacher like to throw trick questions into his<br/>little pre-tests to prepare for the standard ones giving by the<br/>system when Sayuri brought up the reason they were there.<p>"So, um, Akane? Ranma? What was the big secret you couldn't tell us<br/>at school?" Sayuri asked a little worried she was about to break the<br/>good mood everyone was in.<p>Akane gave Ranma-chan a look and received a depressed nod before<br/>going off into the kitchen. Ranma-chan shifted so she could look at<br/>both girls then started, "You remember when Akane told you that I had<br/>gone to China to train? Well that's where the problem started."<p>"Me and Pop where going to an ancient training grounds deep in the<br/>dark of that country. . . I wish we never did as it messed up both of<br/>our lives," Ranma-chan closed her eyes sadly as Akane came back out<br/>with the kettle they asked Kasumi to leave on and a glass of water.<br/>"There is a place called Jusenkyo that has hundreds of little springs<br/>all over it. . . it was a very beautiful place, if not for the<br/>curses. Our travel brochure explained the problems with the place but<br/>Pop tried to save money and bought the one in Chinese. . . then<br/>didn't give it to me to translate. It's not his fault though, neither<br/>one of us believed the Guide we picked up to help find the place when<br/>he warned us. You see, um, every one of the springs holds a curse<br/>that passes to the person who falls into the water. . ."<p>"A curse? Magic's scary," Yuka said with a shudder acting like she<br/>was only listening to a ghost story.<p>"Yeah, Magic's very scary," Ranma-chan replied with a frown before<br/>she continued. "Pop fell in one first from me hitting him, then I<br/>tripped into one. We both didn't understand what had happened at<br/>first. . . then we thought the changes were permanent until the Guide<br/>told us the truth. . ."<p>"Oh come on! I thought you where going to tell us something serious<br/>like. . like. . like anything other then some ghost story," Sayuri<br/>crossed her arms in annoyance not happy at her friend Akane.<p>"Akane, do it," Ranma-chan looked up slightly at the strong girl<br/>behind her then felt the cold water pour over his head as the change<br/>happened causing a couple of loud gasps from the other girls. She<br/>reset her clothes as they didn't fit again before looking at Yuka and<br/>Sayuri. "I fell into the Nannichuan spring, Spring of Drowned Boy,<br/>and I change into a boy every time cold water touches me."<p>"wow," Yuka said quietly as she took in the handsome features of the<br/>now male Ranma.<p>"Magic exists!" Sayuri asked almost in a panic also taking in the<br/>new Ranma-kun.<p>"Evidently," Nabiki replied from the chair she had moved into after<br/>the first movie to get more comfortable. "Ranma actually lucked out<br/>with this curse, Uncle Saotome turns into a Panda."<p>"Akane? Could you please?" Ranma-kun asked again and Akane poured<br/>the water from the kettle on him changing him back to herself causing<br/>Ranma-chan to reset her now very lose clothing.<p>"Hot water changes her back," Akane finished the explanation holding<br/>up the kettle to press the point.<p>"wow," Yuka said again still in a quiet tone as both girls blinked<br/>at the change.<p>"Yeah, big wow," Ranma-chan replied sadly.<p>"Is this why you're a lesbian? You don't think any guy would want<br/>you 'cause you become a guy from time to time?" Sayuri asked knowing<br/>it was impolite but she wanted to know.<p>"No! I've was a lesbian long before this, and I couldn't care less<br/>what some boy thought about this!" Ranma-chan protested loudly trying<br/>to stand up but her body didn't want to comply and she fell back into<br/>the sofa halfway through the movement.<p>"I'm sorry. . I didn't mean to. ." Sayuri started looking concerned<br/>for the red-head who was obviously not doing well.<p>"It's okay, a lot of people get on me about why I 'chose' to be a<br/>lesbian. . . I know some girls choose it 'cause of things that happen<br/>in their lives, or as something different and new, but it didn't work<br/>like that with me. I think I've always been this way," Ranma-chan<br/>replied with a sad smile. "It's not like I don't find a boy cute from<br/>time to time but I just don't think of them like the way other girls<br/>do around me. I can't see myself living a happy life with any guy. .<br/>at least none I've ever met."<p>"And you can see yourself living a happy life with some girl you've<br/>met?" Nabiki asked in curiosity causing the other girls to look her<br/>for a moment before turning back to Ranma-chan.<p>"Several girls over the years actually," Ranma-chan blushed slightly.<p>"I don't think her sexual choice should be an issue here," Akane<br/>stated looking hard at her friends. "Ranma-chan is worried that<br/>you'll think her a freak because of the curse. I've told her that<br/>she's being silly and I know you well enough to know that you'll<br/>accept her."<p>Yuka and Sayuri looked at each other and shrugged before looking at<br/>Ranma-chan. Sayuri was the first to speak again, "Is there a cure?"<p>"Not really, the Guide said that the other spring may cure me, or it<br/>may make things worse by combining the two curses to make a third<br/>form even more sexually confusing," Ranma-chan shook her head as she<br/>thanked the two failed tries to get to the other spring on that first<br/>day.<p>"I don't see what the problem is, she's a very cute boy," Yuka smiled.<p>"Yes she is," Nabiki agreed as Sayuri and Akane gave odd looks to<br/>the two girls.<p>"Maybe we could date from time to time?" Sayuri asked giving Ranma-<br/>chan a nervous smile.<p>"But I'm really a girl no matter what my form looks like," Ranma-<br/>chan replied confused as Akane tried not to respond in either<br/>jealousy or laughter.<p>"What?" Ranma-chan asked as she looked up into Akane's face.<p>"You can tell her Akane," Sayuri said with another nervous smile.<p>Akane gave Sayuri a questioning look to get confirmation to what she<br/>just heard indicating Nabiki's presence before sitting on the edge of<br/>the sofa and looking down at Ranma-chan, "Sayuri is a lesbian too."<p>"Really?" Ranma-chan looked shocked at the girl with the short<br/>brunet hair who simply nodded. Nabiki simply kept her mouth shut for<br/>the moment.<p>"My reasons aren't as lofty as yours, mine is more of a choice,"<br/>Sayuri said quietly trying not to dwell on the past. "At least my<br/>Mother accepts it, even understands it sort of."<p>"Lucky you, my Mother puts up with it but she obviously hates it,"<br/>Ranma-chan smiled back weakly.<p>"So, would you mind a date from time to time? I don't advertise that<br/>I'm a lesbian so I don't get out on many dates and I could really use<br/>a night out like that," Sayuri asked again then noticed the looks<br/>from her two other friends. "It's not the same as having a night out<br/>with friends. . . it's the intimacy."<p>"You've had more dates then I've had I could bet," Ranma-chan<br/>replied with a more real smile. "But I don't see why not. . . as long<br/>as Akane, Nabiki, or Kasumi don't mind that is."<p>"Huh, why do we have a say in this?" Akane asked confused, happy<br/>that Ranma-chan had added her to the list of people who made a<br/>difference in this idea, but confused none the less.<p>"Ranma is engaged to one of us, Akane, so her dating another girl<br/>could look wrong to those who know about that," Nabiki rolled her<br/>eyes as if she couldn't believe her little sister forgot that, but<br/>inside she was laughing at what Ranma-chan was getting at.<p>"You're engaged to them! But you're all girls!" Yuka exclaimed<br/>in shock as Sayuri fell over laughing as it hit her how it could<br/>happen.<p>"It's our Fathers idea!" both Ranma-chan and Akane protested then<br/>they looked at each other and started laughing too.<p>"I don't understand. . ." Yuka said even more confused why almost<br/>everyone was laughing.<p>"Uncle Saotome made a pledge with Daddy to combine the two schools<br/>by marriage. . . since Ranma can become a boy they reasoned that he<br/>could marry one of us and produce heirs," Nabiki explained trying not<br/>to laugh too. "Since Ranma is a lesbian it works out even better. But<br/>Ranma is promised to us first so she really shouldn't be dating<br/>anyone but us."<p>"Oh," Yuka replied not looking completely sure she understood.<p>"I don't see any problems with Ranma and Sayuri going out once in<br/>awhile," Nabiki said with a smile. "I doubt Kasumi wants you that way<br/>Ranma so she isn't really a consideration in this as she's not happy<br/>with your 'life choice'. But I think that if you take Sayuri out on a<br/>date you have to take me and Akane on equal amount of nights out."<p>"Hey! I don't know if I want to. . ." Akane started to protest when<br/>Nabiki put a hand up to stop her as Ranma-chan's features were<br/>showing signs of becoming depress.<p>"Ranma can be a boy on our dates. . . if we want. Besides the whole<br/>school thinks you are dating Ranma-kun as it is so why not have some<br/>fun with it," Nabiki continued then gave an evil smirk. "It'll drive<br/>Kuno nuts to know you are dating Ranma-kun."<p>"It'll drive Kuno nuts to know I'm dating anyone," Ranma-chan cringed.<p>"Then it's settled," Nabiki smirked. "Ranma you are in for a lot of<br/>fun soon."<p>"Yeah, right, fun," Ranma-chan looked dubious about that.<p>"Come on we have some more movies to watch," Akane said quickly not<br/>sure she liked the idea either.<p>- - - -<p>Ranma looked around at the mist and cursed Kuno for ever being born<br/>in any reality. The mists where their standard thickness and the<br/>scene on the screen was that of all the girls, except Nabiki sleeping<br/>on the sofa having passed out.<p>He didn't understand how he pushed through the barriers of the mind<br/>to take control, and the control was only momentary, but he had do so<br/>and it nearly cost Ranma-chan her life. He couldn't even figure out<br/>why he had pushed at that moment but the urge just happened.<p>"That wasn't very bright, child," a scratch old voice stated from<br/>behind him causing him to spin to face the old woman.<p>"What are you doing here!" Ranma demanded even as it confused him.<br/>Standing before him was what he thought was Cologne, but a much older<br/>one then he remembered. . . if that was even possible.<p>"I'm your Guide tonight, child, and as such I'm to answer your<br/>questions," the old woman replied as she hopped over to the screen<br/>and smiled. "It looks like you have even better luck with girls in<br/>this world then you normally do."<p>"I don't have luck with girls at all! They either try ta kill me or<br/>marry me!" Ranma protested as he sat down with arms and legs crossed<br/>in annoyance.<p>"Yes but they rarely ask you if want to date them as these girls<br/>did," the old woman chucked. "Except for the youngest Tendo girl, but<br/>I believe that she will enjoy that too."<p>"The old man from the shop said Akane ain't a lesbian. . . and<br/>Akane's Mother sorta confirmed that too," Ranma stated narrowing his<br/>eyes at the very old woman. "Were they lying ta me?"<p>"No child they were not," the old woman chuckled again. "Just not<br/>telling you everything."<p>"And what is 'everything'?" Ranma asked his agitation growing.<p>"Akane Tendo has been fighting with her desires since she met you,<br/>as she is attracted to you both as a boy and as a girl," the old<br/>woman replied as she stepped off her cane in front of Ranma. "She has<br/>been raised to believe that things like lesbianism is not right, so<br/>how so you think she feels knowing that she is feeling those things<br/>for you as a girl and as a boy. . . and worse she is expected to have<br/>those feeling for you."<p>Turning to look at the screen again she sighed sightly, "If only<br/>Kasumi could have been a bit more like us this problem wouldn't have<br/>happened."<p>"Whatcha mean us?" Ranma asked narrowing his eyes, the more he<br/>looked at the old woman the less she looked like the Cologne he knew.<p>"Nothing, nothing child, it's of no importance anymore," the old<br/>woman waved of the question quickly then turned serious. "So ask your<br/>questions."<p>Ranma continued to narrow his eyes at the old woman but knew if she<br/>was anything like the Cologne he knew she wouldn't answer what he<br/>just asked, "Fine, is Kuno alright?"<p>"Yes child, he will be in bad shape for awhile but he will live<br/>without any more permanent damage then there already was," the old<br/>woman said trying to comfort the boy as he showed that this bothered<br/>him greatly.<p>"How did I do it?" Ranma asked after sighing in relief. "And can I<br/>do it again?"<p>"It was the first step of you and this Ranma becoming one," the old<br/>woman said as smiled sadly at the boy. "You won't be able to do<br/>something of that level for some time but when you can then you will<br/>have accepted this world as your own and this life will be such."<p>"You mean I won't get my Akane back?" Ranma looked worried and<br/>almost panicked.<p>"Your Akane? She's right there," the old woman pointed to the screen<br/>behind her with a smirk on her dry lips. "She is the same as the<br/>Akane who you left so she is 'your' Akane as much as the other was."<p>"But. . but I need ta know if she's doing okay or not," Ranma<br/>protested as he stood again and looked down at the old woman getting<br/>a touch mad.<p>"She is currently doing fine child," the old woman gave Ranma a real<br/>smile. "She'll be fine as you will come back to her in some way or<br/>another."<p>"I thought you said this was gonna be permanent?" Ranma looked<br/>confused again. "How can I go back ta her if I'm stuck here?"<p>"Time will show you how child," the old woman smirked again then<br/>hopped back on her staff looking ready to leave. "I believe that is<br/>all the time we have child, as someone is about to wake you."<p>Ranma quickly looked at the screen to see what the old woman was<br/>talking about but before he could focus on anything the entire place<br/>started to blur and he started to disappear.<p>The old woman watched him vanish sadly and blew the place he was<br/>standing a small kiss, "Until I'm allowed back my love."<p>- - - -<p>Author's Notes: Over six months! Ouch! I'm sorry to the people who<br/>have been waiting for this. . . but I had written more then seven<br/>more chapters on paper months ago and then went and lost the lot.<br/>I've finally given up hope of finding the pages and have started to<br/>wrote from scratch the chapters I needed to get back to. I hope that<br/>the delay for the next chapter won't be anywhere near as bad but<br/>other fics have me tied up a bit so I'm not sure. All I can say is<br/>that if I post the fic on FFN then I do plan to continue it at some<br/>time and not leave it hanging for ever (I hate it when other writers<br/>do that so I shouldn't be guilty of it myself) I just have to learn<br/>to start writing one shot fics instead of long plotted out fics like<br/>this one.<p>I will leave comments about this chapter to you as I'll leave it to<br/>you to e-mail me with the questions and then I'll try to answer them<br/>in either the next AN or on the review page. I like C+C but flames<br/>will be ignored completely as they do nothing but discourage a writer<br/>from getting better.
