</div>. . . I have no idea from this point on . . .<p>Ranma's Wish, Chapter one<br/>By Felix Webster<p>All original Ranma 1/2 Characters Copyright Rumiko Takahashi (first<br/>published by Shogakugan in Japan and brought over to North America by<br/>Viz Communications), and are used without permission.<br/>Please don't sue... cause I have no money.<p>I want to thank the following people for things (like pre reading):<br/>Chris Stassen<br/>Paul Blay<p>" " - speech<br/>* * - thoughts<br/>( ) - other languages - Chinese mostly -<br/>[ ] - Panda signs<p>- The same old story. . . -<p>The sky was doing it's best to drown the district of Nerima with a<br/>light but steady rain. Two figures walked down the streets of the town,<br/>gaining stares from those they passed. The pair were very unusual, as<br/>one was a handsome young man, and the other a panda. Both were carrying<br/>packs and had the look of hard travels in their eyes.<p>"I'm telling you, Pop, this is a bad idea," the young man said as he<br/>stopped walking, turned to face the panda and cocked an eyebrow, "I<br/>know you and your friend made this silly agreement years ago, but you<br/>told me that he only had daughters, so how do you plan to pull this one<br/>off, huh?"<p>The boy seemed calm enough to the onlookers. . . Calm, but crazy, he<br/>was talking to a panda after all, until that same panda held up a sign<br/>in response, [They're girls and you're a boy, so everything will] -flip-<br/>[work out fine]. The boy gave the panda a nasty look after reading the<br/>sign, "And that's your fault too!"<p>At the sound of the accusation the panda moved into a ready stance,<br/>but the boy just turned back to the direction they were originally<br/>heading in. "Don't get worked up, Pop, I said I'd go and see this<br/>friend of yours, and I stand by my word," the boy stated, shaking his<br/>head at the panda's actions.<p>As the two started on their way again the boy looked into the rainy<br/>afternoon sky, "I just hope they don't go ballistic when they find out<br/>about this," he said sadly to himself.<p>The neighbourhood street was a peaceful place today, no one had a care<br/>in the world and all one had to was enjoy the light cleansing rain. . .<br/>unfortunately good things never last.<p>-<p>"YOU DID WHAT!"<p>A girl's voice could be heard for blocks in every direction, scaring<br/>small children and animals.<p>"Calm down, Akane. I said my friend, Genma Saotome, and I made a pact<br/>to unite our schools. We each agreed to engage one of our children to<br/>the other in marriage." Although Soun Tendo looked calm inside he was<br/>very excited by the postcard he held in his hand. "They'll be here<br/>soon."<p>"How could you do this? Without even asking us!" Akane continued her<br/>rant, she crossed her arms and gave her father a stare that could melt<br/>titanium.<p>Nabiki smirked at her sister's attitude, Nabiki herself thought this<br/>might be fun. . . or profitable, "Give it a rest, Sis. You never know<br/>he could very good looking and rich, right daddy?" She turned to her<br/>father looking for a response.<p>Soun put a hand behind his head and laughed slightly, "I don't know,<br/>I've never met the boy."<p>"WHAT!"<p>The scream was so loud and full of anger it caused the boy to be<br/>distracted enough from trying to look for the person who had screamed<br/>the first time, trying to play hero, that he ran into a telephone pole.<br/>The panda came running up to boy and held up another sign, [Ha, caught<br/>you!], it then slapped its forehead was it realized the boy couldn't<br/>read the sign while unconscious. The panda threw the boy over its<br/>shoulder, then headed back on its way oblivious of the staring people.<p>"What do you mean you've never met him!" Akane continued to scream,<br/>but not with the same volume as her throat was getting sore.<p>"The pact was made just after Kasumi's birth, and my friend didn't<br/>have a child yet," Soun said never losing his calm as he was used to<br/>his daughter's temper.<p>"Oh great, just great!" Akane just wouldn't give up her protests, but<br/>she was running out of things to say.<p>"Akane, calm down," the eldest sister instructed very sternly. "I just<br/>hope he isn't too much younger than me, it could cause. . . problems,"<br/>Kasumi mused, sipping her tea while thinking about how to prepare for<br/>the house guests that were coming.<p>"I hope he's rich and handsome, Kasumi. A bit of an age difference<br/>wouldn't be so bad with those things going for a person," Nabiki said<br/>with a devious smile.<p>"Kasumi! Nabiki! I can't believe that you're going along with this. .<br/>. stupid plan!" Akane screamed, looking betrayed by her sisters.<p>The outer door to the family house opened right after Akane's<br/>statement, and the sound of something very large entering came from<br/>that direction.<p>"Put. Me. Down. Old man!" said a strong male voice from the same area,<br/>"I said I wasn't gunna run away!"<p>"That must be Ranma!" Nabiki said as she jumped up and ran to the door<br/>to greet him, with her father close behind her. A few seconds later<br/>both came running back in a panic, followed by a large panda with a<br/>person over its shoulder.<p>"Put me down, you're scaring them!" the boy yelled as he hit the panda<br/>in the head. The panda reached over and grabbed the boy and placed him<br/>down in front of itself. Soun had partially recovered by this time and<br/>decided he had to ask, "You wouldn't be. . ."<p>The boy cut him off quickly, " I'm Ranma Saotome, sorry about this,"<br/>he said without making eye contact, and looking very depressed.<p>Soun was ecstatic at this news, "Oh happy day, now our two schools can<br/>be united!" he exclaimed as he hugged Ranma with all his might.<p>Nabiki gave Ranma a once over, she found the Chinese style red silk<br/>shirt and black pants an interesting choice, but it looked good on him<br/>she thought. She smiled at her sisters, "Well, he's handsome."<p>Akane crossed her arms and gave a, "Humph!" and looked away in<br/>disgust. Kasumi just sipped her tea smiling sweetly.<p>"Could you. . . please stop it, I. . . can't breathe!" Ranma said<br/>urgently, while struggling in Soun's hug.<p>Soun gave a short laugh and then released Ranma, "Well, my boy, it's<br/>great to have you here," he said and gave Ranma a hard slap on the<br/>boy's back, causing Ranma to stumble slightly.<p>Kasumi, who had been sitting quietly, had in fact been trying to think<br/>of a way to delay her father, she had a plan now and was waiting for<br/>the right time to act.<p>She didn't have to wait long.<p>Soun had just opened his mouth to introduce his daughters when Kasumi<br/>cut him off, "Father, before we continue this discussion I think we<br/>should let Ranma settle in first," she said it so sweetly, but also<br/>with a undertone not to be refused.<p>"A. . . a fine idea, Kasumi. There's no reason to rush matters now<br/>that Ranma is here," Soun replied trying to look patient.<p>Nabiki gave Ranma another look over. "So, you're a martial artist<br/>huh?" she asked with a weird look on her face. She was thinking of the<br/>money she could make off him if he was good.<p>"Um. . . Yeah," Ranma replied nervously, feeling like side of beef.<p>Nabiki chuckled slightly, she decided that there was only one way to<br/>find out, "You know, Akane's a martial artist too. Maybe you two should<br/>spar to see who's better."<p>Akane started to growl at her sister, then got a nasty grin on her<br/>face, "Yeah, why don't we."<p>Ranma didn't like the look on Akane's face, it wasn't at all friendly,<br/>but he figured things would be better after the ice was broken, "Um. .<br/>. okay."<p>-<p>Ranma liked the look of the little dojo he was standing in, it had a<br/>loved feeling as if it was well used and well cared for. After they had<br/>bowed to the spirit of the dojo and then to each other, Ranma waited in<br/>a relaxed stance watching for Akane's attack. Akane, on the other hand,<br/>was getting even more mad that this boy wasn't taking her seriously.<br/>She clenched her hands and decided she'd teach him that he was making a<br/>mistake!<p>Akane's first strike was a kick aimed at Ranma's head, but it never<br/>connected as Ranma leaped it in a dodge. She tried several other<br/>attacks, all aimed to truly hurt her opponent, but all missed as Ranma<br/>just moved around them.<br/>"Will you fight back!" Akane screamed at Ranma, "What, are you too<br/>weak to fight a girl?"<p>Ranma seemed unfazed by Akane's jibe at his honour, "I thought this<br/>was a friendly little match?" he asked calmly.<p>Akane spat in his direction, "Friendly! Friendly! You come here in to<br/>this house and force one of us to marry you, and want a friendly little<br/>match!" she screamed.<p>Ranma moved past another of Akane's strikes confused by Akane's level<br/>of anger, "Hey, It's not my idea! And trust me the marriage isn't gonna<br/>happen anyway," he said plainly.<p>"Damn it! Fight me!" she howled at him in a even larger fit of rage,<br/>then threw another kick at his head with all her strength.<p>Ranma was tired of this fight, and Akane's anger was rubbing of on<br/>him, "Fine! If you want a fight you got one!" Ranma shouted back. His<br/>next moves were blindingly fast as he blocked the kick, then spun her<br/>to hit a nerve cluster in her back.<p>Akane hopped off slightly trying to regain her balance, she was on the<br/>verge of issuing a scathing comment about Ranma's lack of manhood when<br/>she felt her legs give out. Akane realized she had lost the fight as<br/>she was falling toward the floor.<p>Ranma tried to ease Akane's fall to the floor, but was rewarded by her<br/>trying to take his head off with her elbow. "What is your problem!"<br/>Ranma asked in frustration, as he stepped away.<p>Akane was in a true panic about losing to a boy, but tried to hide it<br/>the best way she knew how. . . with anger. "I HATE BOYS!" she screamed<br/>at him.<p>Ranma was shocked by the pure venom in Akane's statement, but he was<br/>still mad at her actions. "I don't much like boys myself, but I don't<br/>go out of my way to try and cripple them!" he said as he walked away<br/>shaking his head, then looked back. "Don't worry about your legs,<br/>you'll get the feeling back in a few minutes."<p>Akane sat in the middle of the dojo, "you don't understand. . ." she<br/>said quietly to the empty room, then started to cry.<p>-<p>*Geez, what is that girl's problem with guys!* Ranma was trying to<br/>decipher what might be wrong with the girl he just fought, then stopped<br/>with wide eyes, *She couldn't have been . . . been. . . No, that would<br/>have shown in her aura.*<p>Ranma was lost in his thoughts when Kasumi stopped him. "Ranma, here<br/>are some towels. The furo is downstairs," she said smiling.<p>"Ah. . ., It's okay ,Kasumi, I really don't need a bath just yet,"<br/>Ranma replied nervously.<p>"You've been fi. . . sparring, and in this house you take a bath after<br/>you exercise," she said firmly as she put the towels in Ranma's hands<br/>and left.<p>Ranma sat on the washing stool while he filled a bucket with cold<br/>water. *Aww man, what are they going to think when they see me?*<br/>He doused himself with the water, "Ack, cold!" he said shivering, then<br/>stepped into the hot furo. The change in his body relaxed her as the<br/>hot water soaked in to her form.<p>-<p>*That bastard! How could he beat me! I've proven myself against more<br/>than 20 guys at a time and no one has beaten me before!* Akane was<br/>still fuming as she walked into the bathroom's outer area. As she<br/>started to strip off her gi and threw in on a pile, she totally missed<br/>the fact other clothes were already there. *Why'd he have to be so<br/>good?* She opened the furo door still in thought, and heard water<br/>splashing. Akane looked up quickly, dreading who she expected she<br/>walked in on, only to find a red-haired girl in the furo desperately<br/>trying to cover herself. "Oh, excuse me, I didn't realize the bath was<br/>in use," Akane said calmly, then she closed the door. She quietly<br/>dressed in her panties and gi top, then left the outer room, where she<br/>snapped out of her daze and ran to the living room.<p>Ranma-chan sat back down in the furo, relaxing after the last few<br/>tense moments where she tried to cover herself when someone walked in.<br/>"Don't they know how to knock in this house!" she said in mock disgust,<br/>then thought about what she had seen, "Well, she does have a great<br/>body," she said to herself with a smirk.<p>-<p>Akane ran into the house at a flat out pace, skidding to a halt in the<br/>living room. "There's a burglar in the bathroom!" she screamed as she<br/>grabbed the first large blunt object she could find, which was the<br/>table of course.<p>"Akane, calm down," Kasumi said with concern about the mental state of<br/>her youngest sister.<p>Nabiki rolled her eyes and asked, "Honestly, Akane, what would a<br/>burglar find to steal in our bathroom?"<p>"She was taking a bath!" Akane answered with annoyance, then noticed<br/>that her sisters were looking past her to the doorway. She turned<br/>around and found the red haired girl standing in the doorway.<p>Kasumi was the first to speak up. "Oh, hello. . . do we know you?" she<br/>asked trying to place the familiar face of this girl.<p>The red haired girl looked down. "I'm Ranma Saotome, sorry about<br/>earlier," she said with a weak smile.<p>Akane dropped the table in shock of what she heard the girl say,<br/>unfortunately for her it was right above her head. "Ouch."<p>Nabiki ignored her sister, "If you're Ranma, who was the guy that was<br/>here earlier?" she asked in her best businesslike voice.<p>"That was me too," Ranma-chan answered, then sat down across from<br/>Nabiki at the replaced table. "It's kinda hard to explain, but me and<br/>the boy you met earlier are the same person."<p>A strange man walked into the room with Soun Tendo. "Let me explain. .<br/>." he started as he grabbed Ranma-chan's shirt and threw her out of the<br/>house, right into a koi pond that was minding its own business.<p>The boy from earlier surfaced from the pond. "Watcha do that for,<br/>Pop!" he yelled at the man. Ranma-kun stepped out of the pond and<br/>started to reset his clothes, he squirmed slightly then reached into<br/>his shirt to pull out the Koi hidden there. "You coulda showed them in<br/>another way, I didn't have to get soaked to the bone!" he said as he<br/>looked at the fish. He then threw the fish back into the pond and ran<br/>back into the house.<p>Soun turned to his daughters, who were stunned at the scene which had<br/>just played out before them, "This is my good friend, Genma Saotome,<br/>he's Ranma's father," he said as he patted Genma on the shoulder.<p>"And a no good panda!" Ranma-kun said as he threw a bucket of water on<br/>his father, which initiated Genma's change.<p>"Oh my, it's the panda from earlier," Kasumi exclaimed. The three<br/>sisters were caught in wide-eyed shock having seen this impossibility.<p>"I saw it. . . but I still don't believe it," Nabiki finally was able<br/>to say after a few minutes of watching the boy and the panda in a<br/>strength struggle.<p>Ranma-kun shifted slightly to one side causing the panda to lose its<br/>balance and fall away from him as he turned to the girls. "Well, Pop<br/>can't talk in his panda form, so I'll explain," Ranma-kun said as he<br/>sat down at the table again and gave his father a glare. "And he'd<br/>probably lie about it too."<p>-<p>"We were travelling in China during school's summer break, Pop here<br/>had heard of this incredible, ancient training ground he wanted me to<br/>see," Ranma-kun started his tale as he moved his glare off of his<br/>father and looked at the sisters. He noticed Akane wasn't giving him<br/>dirty looks anymore, in fact she looked embarrassed for some reason.<p>"Do you do this kind of travelling often?" Nabiki asked in interest.<p>"Well, Mom only lets Pop take me on training trips during school<br/>breaks so mostly we had to stay in Japan. He convinced her this was<br/>necessary for my training," Ranma-kun explained as he thought about<br/>wanting to see his mother again. "Pop wanted to take me on a large<br/>training trip when I was little, but Mom wouldn't let him take a little<br/>girl away from her home for more an a month at a time, and when I<br/>started school he had to wait till I had time off."<p>"So, Um, you're really a girl?" Akane asked in a small voice.<p>"Yeah, I'm a girl," Ranma-kun replied to her question then cocked an<br/>eyebrow, "Why? You have a problem with girls too?"<p>Akane just cringed at the rebuke but didn't say anything; she just sat<br/>there and looked away.<p>"You were telling us how this happened," Nabiki pointed out with<br/>impatience.<p>"Right, as I said we had gone to this place called 'Jusenkyo', it was<br/>impressive, over a hundred little springs with bamboo poles sticking<br/>out of them. It's supposed to be a balance training exercise, though we<br/>didn't know there was a consequence for falling off at the time," Ranma-<br/>kun paused as Soun poured hot water over her head. "While fighting, I<br/>slipped past Pop's defences and accidentally knocked him into a<br/>spring," Ranma-chan looked apologetically at her father when she said<br/>this, "The next I knew a huge panda came to the surface, laying face<br/>down in the water. I hopped down and approached the panda, cause I was<br/>looking for Pop, but the Guide distracted me and I slipped and landed<br/>in another spring." Ranma-chan couldn't help remembering she felt a<br/>sharp pain in her leg before it gave out, but she didn't want to<br/>mention it. "I felt a weird sensation through out my whole body before<br/>I surfaced," Ranma-chan said with a shiver, "The Guide was yelling a<br/>bunch of stuff at us, but I was in too much shock when I saw my body to<br/>listen to him. Later, when both me and Pop calmed down, the Guide<br/>explained how the curses worked."<p>Nabiki looked at Genma, who had also changed back, "And you didn't<br/>take the time to find out about these curses before you went there?"<br/>she asked with obvious disgust in her voice.<p>"I bought a travel brochure about the place," Genma said in his defence.<p>"Yeah, but it was in Chinese!" Ranma-chan said.<p>"It was cheaper," Genma replied back.<p>"YOU CAN'T READ A WORD OF CHINESE!" The tears finally started to fall<br/>from Ranma-chan's eyes as she screamed at him. "If you'd just gave the<br/>brochure to me I could have seen the warning. . ." she said quietly<br/>through her tears, ". . . and we could be home right now with Mom."<p>To Akane the tears on the girl's face was proof enough that it was a<br/>girl and not a boy, because no boy as tough as Ranma would ever cry in<br/>public. She quickly moved over to Ranma-chan and tried to comfort the<br/>girl. Ranma-chan looked at Akane in surprise, she didn't expect to be<br/>comforted as she was a freak, she especially didn't expect it to come<br/>from Akane.<p>"Ranma. . . I'm sorry! If I knew, I would never have acted. . ." Akane<br/>started to apologize, but she was cut off by her father.<p>"Saotome! You told me Ranma had a hot water curse and was a BOY!" Soun<br/>said while shaking Genma by the shoulders. "How did you plan to unite<br/>our two schools with only girls!"<p>"Calm down Soun, old friend, It's not a difficulty at all," Genma said<br/>with a nervous smile.<p>Soun gave his 'old friend' a glare, "If you are suggesting that I<br/>marry. . ."<p>"Noooo, that isn't what I meant!" Genma answered waving his hands in<br/>front of himself. He paused for a moment to compose himself then he<br/>continued, "I asked the Guide about the Nannichuan curse and he said<br/>she could father children while in male form."<p>"Are you suggesting the she marry one of us and live as a man!"<br/>Akane asked. She couldn't believe to gall of this man. "Have you even<br/>asked Ranma about this yet?"<p>Genma looked uncomfortable, "My wife gave me no sons, so I have tried<br/>to raise Ranma as if she were that son of which I so wished for. I have<br/>tried to impart in her a man's sense of honour and responsibility,<br/>unfortunately it seems she also has developed a man's taste in<br/>relationships. . ."<p>"I don't understand, what's 'a man's taste in relationships' supposed<br/>to mean?" Akane asked confused, as Kasumi choked on some tea and Nabiki<br/>gave a surprised short laugh.<p>Ranma-chan looked into Akane's eyes. "It means, I like girls," she<br/>said with a weak smile.<p>"Well, I like girls too," Akane started, then her eyes widened with<br/>shocked realization. "Oh. . ."<p>"Yeah," Ranma replied to Akane's unasked question, nervously expecting<br/>Akane to be repulsed by her perversion.<p>"When I . . .when I said I liked girls I didn't mean . . . mean that I<br/>. . . " Akane tried to explain herself.<p>"It's okay, Akane, I understand," Ranma-chan said calmly. "Hopefully<br/>we can be friends at least?"<p>"I just never thought about it, I mean I hate boys and all, but I have<br/>don't . . ." Akane stopped when she realized what Ranma-chan had asked,<br/>"You still want to be friends after all that stuff I yelled at you?"<p>"I don't know what was done to you to make you that mad at boys, but I<br/>won't hold it against you as I'm a girl," Ranma-chan said as friendly<br/>as she could. ". . . and I could use some friends right now," she added<br/>quietly with another weak smile.<p>"Of course, Ranma!" Akane said happily, "Of course I'll be your friend."<p>Soun watched his youngest daughter and the child of his best friend,<br/>it was nice to see a smile on Akane's face, but he wasn't sure he liked<br/>Genma's idea. He looked at his friend, who looked proud of himself at<br/>his cleverness, and made a decision. "Genma, I'm not about to engage<br/>one of my daughters to another girl, even one which becomes a boy," he<br/>cut off Genma's protest then continued, "but I am willing to allow them<br/>to find out for themselves if they could live with this or not. As it<br/>stands both you and Ranma can stay until they make up their minds."<p>A while later, after the girls asked Ranma-chan questions about what<br/>being a guy was like and the fathers got reacquainted, sleeping<br/>arrangements had to be made.<p>"Ranma can't sleep in the same room as her father, it's just not<br/>right," Kasumi said after hearing Genma's ideas as to arrangements.<p>"But we have been sharing tents on training trips for years," Genma<br/>stated.<p>"Only cause it saved space in the packs, Pop," Ranma replied annoyed.<p>"You can stay in my room with me, Ranma," Akane said with a smile,<br/>"I've got what used to be the guest room, and it's more then big enough<br/>for two people."<p>"You sure you want to share a room with a pervert, Akane?" Ranma-chan<br/>asked.<p>"You're NOT a pervert!" Akane said sternly, "Don't think of yourself<br/>like that!"<p>"I was kidding, Akane. I came to terms with it a long time ago," Ranma-<br/>chan said with a smile.<p>"Um, yeah. . . come on I'll show you the room," Akane said, still<br/>unsure about her new friend, but she wanted to make up for her earlier<br/>attitude as much as she could.<p>Sometime later, as all were asleep, Ranma became aware. He stood up,<br/>and found himself in a place he couldn't completely describe. As he<br/>turned around he saw a scene of Ranma-chan and Akane sleeping with<br/>contentment in the same bed played out as if it was on a screen that<br/>wasn't there, "What the heck is going on!" he said to whatever might<br/>be listening.<p>"You're living what you wished for," said a voice that came from<br/>beside him.<br/>Ranma jumped, then noticed it was the old man from the store.<p>"Whatcha mean what I wished for! I didn't wish for this!" Ranma said<br/>in anger as he waved his hand at the image.<p>"This is the best combination for the wishes you made," the old man<br/>replied calmly, "You were warned to only make one wish."<p>"How is this even close to my wishes!" Ranma asked, the tension<br/>showing in his voice.<p>The old man looked to the image and said, "Well, you wished to restart<br/>your relationship with the girl, Akane, and it has been granted.<p>"But I also wished to have my curse gone, not to become a GIRL!" Ranma<br/>screamed the last word at what he saw on the screen. "Worse than that,<br/>she's a pervert, a . . ."<p>"Lesbian. Well, you can't have a truly loving relationship with<br/>another girl if you are straight, now could you?" the old man said<br/>looking almost as if he was enjoying himself. "And as for your wish<br/>dealing with your curse, you said you wanted your 'Nyanniichuan curse'<br/>gone, didn't you?"<p>"Of course I did," Ranma said, not knowing where this was going.<p>"And it has been granted. Unfortunately, to make accommodations for your<br/>other wishes it had to become a Nannichuan curse." the old man replied.<p>Ranma was too stunned to continue the conversation for some time.<br/>After a bit of thinking he finally had a few questions for the man, who<br/>was admiring the girls on the screen.<p>"Okay, I want some answers," Ranma stated.<p>'That is why I'm here, I will explain any question dealing with your<br/>wishes," the old man said, then added, "as long as it pertains with<br/>what has already happened."<p>"Um, okay," Ranma replied. He didn't completely understand what the<br/>old man meant, but he probably figure it out soon enough. "Why don't I<br/>remember her life, I mean before this afternoon?"<p>"Simple, We could have put you into her life at her birth, but that<br/>would take too long to show you we were granting your wishes, so we put<br/>you into her just before your first meeting with the person who was the<br/>most important part of your wishes," the old man explained, but he<br/>noticed Ranma had a confused look on his face, so he added, "You have<br/>all her memories when you are her, but when you are here you have only<br/>memories that you have experienced as her, or those memories brought up<br/>by situations she encounters."<p>"Ah, I think I understand," Ranma started as he tried to work it out.<br/>"So, I will know what her past was like when it comes back to haunt<br/>her?"<p>"Pretty much," the old man replied with a touch of humour.<p>"Okay, I leave that one for another time. . . what I'd like to know<br/>now is why she doesn't look like me?" Ranma said pointing at the screen.<p>"I don't know what you mean, she looks just like you," the old man<br/>answered with a touch of confusion.<p>"Oh, lets start with the body. She's taller than my cursed form, and<br/>she's got smaller, um, breasts." He started his point boldly until that<br/>last part of his statement.<p>"Well, for one thing she is not your cursed form. She has grown up a<br/>girl, and through extensive training before and during puberty she has<br/>developed to what you see there," the old man pointed out one of the<br/>sleeping forms.<p>"But that doesn't explain the breasts, I mean they're smaller than<br/>Akane's!" Ranma realized he should be having problems with his<br/>annoyance with this fact, but right now he just wanted answers.<p>"Body fat is one of the things which adds to breast size, that girl<br/>has very little extra body fat to help breast production," the old man<br/>said while admiring the image of the girl he was describing.<p>"Um, that makes sense, I guess." Ranma would have to think about that<br/>one later, he had other questions. "Why is her hair short and spiky,<br/>and no pigtail?"<p>"I can't explain that one just yet, it will become evident later." The<br/>old man looked at an watch he could only see. "any other questions"<p>"Yeah, a couple. She said that she had only been on training missions<br/>during school breaks. . . has she been living with her mother?. . .is<br/>she as good as I was at that point?" Ranma asked.<p>"Yes, as stated earlier you mother wouldn't let your father take a<br/>little girl on extended training trips. Your father did convince your<br/>mother that some training trips were necessary to improve the girl's<br/>skills," the old man answered.<p>"What about her skills?" Ranma wanted to know the trade-off to staying<br/>home with his mother vs. the 10 years with his father.<p>"She is very close to your level of skill. Minus one specific style,<br/>but that is only because she was trying so hard to prove herself to her<br/>father, who wanted a son more that anything else in the world," the old<br/>man answered. Though he looked disappointed about something Ranma<br/>couldn't figure out. "Some people don't know when they have a good<br/>thing."<p>"I can understand her reasons for trying so hard, I have been doing<br/>the same thing since the curse. . . to prove to myself, as well as Pop,<br/>that I was still the man I was," Ranma said depressed. "I don't think I<br/>would have improved so much in such a short time otherwise."<p>"That's a good realization, a very mature one." The old man looked<br/>proud at Ranma's statement. "We have little time left, is there<br/>anything else you want to know?"<p>"Um, yeah. . . is Akane. . . a. . .," Ranma tried to ask but he<br/>couldn't get the question out for fear of what it might mean in his<br/>other life.<p>"No, she not a lesbian if that is what you wanted to know," the old<br/>man answered knowing that this question was coming. " We did nothing to<br/>alter her as it wasn't needed to grant the wishes. And before you ask,<br/>yes she would have attacked you like that if you had showed up as a guy<br/>the first time you met. She is a high-spirited young girl by nature who<br/>had some very bad experiences with boys at a very vulnerable time of<br/>her life, she had her freedom of choice taken away for her and you were<br/>just too much better than her for her ego to take."<p>"I would probably have had an easier time with her if I just was a<br/>little more offensive when I sparred with her, but I can't hit a girl<br/>without a damn good reason," Ranma said sadly, "I guess I don't have<br/>that problem anymore either."<p>"Well, you've made some very impressive realizations tonight, sir, but<br/>it is time for you to go back in to that Ranma there," the old man said<br/>pointing to the girl on the screen who was moving as if she was about<br/>to wake up.<p>For Ranma the little world of blue faded way and he stopped being just<br/>himself.<p>Ranma-chan woke up slowly trying desperately to hold on to her dream.<br/>She knew it was important but it slipped away from her mental grip like<br/>the sands it was made up of.<p>Next up: The first day of school is always hell. . .<p>
