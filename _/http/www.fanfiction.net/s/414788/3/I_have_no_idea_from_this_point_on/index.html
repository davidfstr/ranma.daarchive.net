I have no idea from this point on . . .<p>Ranma's Wish, Chapter two<br/>By Felix Webster<p>All original Ranma ½ Characters Copyright Rumiko Takahashi (first<br/>published by Shogakugan in Japan and brought over to North America by<br/>Viz Communications), and are used without permission.<br/>Please don't sue . . . cause I have no money.<p>Special thanks to my pre readers<br/>Chris Stassen<br/>Paul Blay (sorry about the spelling mistake in the last two pieces)<p>" " - speech<br/>* * - thoughts<br/>( ) - other languages - Chinese mostly -<br/>[ ] - Panda signs<p>-The first day of school is always hell . . . -<p>Ranma-chan woke up slowly, desperately trying to hold on to her<br/>dream. She knew it was important but it slipped away from her mental<br/>grip like the sands it was made up of.<p>As she slowly opened her eyes the morning sun made her close them<br/>again quickly. *Damn, why'd Mom leave the curtains open,* she thought<br/>in a groggy haze of near sleep. She decided to stretch her arms, but<br/>bumped into someone beside her. *Oops, guess I'm not home. I guess I<br/>better get Pop up for training now,* she thought, as she smiled to<br/>herself. She reached over and shook the body beside her and was<br/>rewarded with a 'Hmmmph' from the sleeping form, but it was defiantly<br/>not male.<p>Ranma-chan sat up suddenly totally awake, not knowing why she was in<br/>this room. She looked over to the unfamiliar sleeping girl beside her<br/>and slowly recognized Akane from the night before. Realizing where<br/>she was caused her to relax, though she knew she had to get up for<br/>her daily training with her father.<p>She got out of bed and changed from her pajamas to her gi as quietly<br/>as she could, so not to wake her new friend. As she was about to<br/>leave the room she turned and crouched down to take a look at the<br/>girl she had just slept with. *The guys back at school would have<br/>killed for a chance like this,* she thought with a chuckle. "Lucky<br/>for you I'm a gentleman, even if I am a lady," she said in a soft<br/>whisper.<p>There was some kind of noise coming from outside the house and it<br/>caused Akane to wake up badly. She sat up and looked at the clock on<br/>her desk, as far as she was concerned it read way too early for her<br/>sleepy mind's liking.<p>"Ranma, you up?" she asked as groggy haze. When she didn't get a<br/>response she looked over to the other side of the bed, only to find<br/>it empty. "She must of gone to the bathroom," Akane said to herself.<br/>The sounds came again and this time she suddenly became worried that<br/>someone was attacking her new friend. She bolted out of her bed and<br/>ran toward the living room. She reached the door to the backyard and<br/>witnessed a sight that left her so stunned that she slumped to her<br/>knees.<p>"Okay Ranma, this time I'm not going easy on you!" Genma yelled at<br/>his daughter. Although it sounded very serious he said it with a wide<br/>grin on his face.<p>"It's the way I like it, Pop!" Ranma-chan shouted back in a happy<br/>sounding voice.<p>They both leapt into the air and started sparring while they hung<br/>there defying gravity. Akane watched, shocked by the skill she was<br/>watching. "Wow, where'd they learn to do that?" she said to herself.<p>Ranma-chan landed near where Akane was watching as they broke apart.<br/>Ranma-chan turned and smiled at her new friend, "Hey, Akane, you're<br/>up!"<p>"Um. . .yeah," Akane replied. "What are you two doing?" she asked in<br/>confusion.<p>"We're training," Ranma-chan answered as she dodged a strike from<br/>her father. "Why don't you get your gi on and join us?" Ranma-chan<br/>asked as she threw a series of kicks back at her father.<p>Akane watched as Genma blocked all of the kicks and leap away from<br/>his opponent. "Do you have any idea what time it is, Ranma?"<p>"Yeah, so?" Ranma replied as she leapt at her father and launched<br/>her next attack. Genma was ready for the move though, and launched<br/>his own surprise counter-attack. The next thing Ranma-chan knew she<br/>was flying backwards, so she righted herself and fell right into the<br/>pond.<p>"Good one, Pop!" Ranma-kun said in praise, then noticed his voice<br/>had changed. "Oh great! I guess a bath won't hurt me now that I'm<br/>already wet," he said as stepped out of the pond and reset his gi.<p>Akane suddenly flashed red with anger at seeing a boy in her yard.<br/>She had to calm herself down, reminding herself that the boy in front<br/>of her was a girl with an bad curse. She turned back into the house<br/>only to find both of her sisters standing there also watching the<br/>combatants.<p>"You know, she's a really great looking guy," Nabiki said to Kasumi<br/>with her patented devious smile.<p>"Yes, she is. I better set the bath for the day since it looks like<br/>she'll need it." Kasumi walk off seemingly unfazed by what she had<br/>watched.<p>"That's enough for today, Pop. I'm gonna need get ready now," Ranma-<br/>kun said as he turned to his father. "You want to join me, Akane?" he<br/>asked over his shoulder as he turned to walk toward the bathroom.<p>"What!" Akane said in pure shock. Having had years of experience<br/>with her sister, Nabiki, she noticed Ranma-kun had nothing devious in<br/>his face. "Um. . . okay," she said in a small voice.<p>-<p>Ranma-chan and Akane relaxed in the furo facing each other. Akane<br/>was surprised at how comfortable she was at that moment. "Ranma?" she<br/>started as she realized she was very curious about her new friend and<br/>the bath was the most private place they were going to find in the<br/>house.<p>"Yeah, Akane?" Ranma-chan replied, her eyes were closed with<br/>contentment as her body soaked in the heat.<p>"How'd you know?" Akane asked straight out. She hoped she hadn't<br/>insulted her friend by being so bold, but she had to know.<p>"Know what?" Ranma-chan replied without opening her eyes. She knew<br/>what Akane was asking, but she also knew Akane needed to word it in a<br/>way she was comfortable with if she was ever to understand the answer.<p>"Um. . . That you're, um. . . That you like girls in that way?"<br/>Akane may have stumbled when she started her question, but she<br/>finally got it out.<p>"How do you know you're not?" Ranma-chan countered with a devious<br/>smile.<p>"What! I. . . Ah. . . I just know!" Akane was caught off guard and<br/>replied quickly with an answer even she wasn't totally sure of. To be<br/>honest she had never really thought about it before, even though many<br/>people at school had accused her of it.<p>"I'm just kidding, Akane," Ranma-chan said with a chuckle, and reach<br/>farther across the furo to pat Akane's hand. "I've been around guys a<br/>lot in the last few years. You see, Pop has a job as Phys. Ed.<br/>Instructor at an all boy's school near our home. He talked Mom into<br/>letting me go there as it had a better curriculum than the regular<br/>school, and 'cause tuition was free for the kids of Instructors,"<br/>Ranma-chan related evenly as if it was the most natural thing in the<br/>world.<p>"How'd they let you get away with it?" Akane asked with a lot of<br/>interest. She couldn't believe an all boys school would allow that,<br/>even for an instructor's child.<p>"Basically, I bound my breasts and acted like one of those boys who<br/>hadn't developed yet," Ranma-chan answered. "It's not like I've got<br/>much to bind," she said with obvious disgust.<p>"Don't say that, Ranma, you've got great breasts!" Akane said in her<br/>friends defence.<p>"Thanks Akane, but they're not as great as yours," Ranma-chan said<br/>with sly smile on her face.<p>"Thanks. . . Wait! We are NOT having this conversation!" Akane said<br/>with obvious strain in her voice.<p>"Sorry Akane, I couldn't resist," Ranma-chan said with a chuckle.<br/>"To get back to answering your question, I was around guys every<br/>school day and I never felt anything but friendship for any of them.<br/>I really didn't think much about it for a long time, till I realized<br/>I was admiring the girls with my friends when they girl watched, for<br/>the same reasons they were. . . I found girls sexy." Ranma-chan<br/>waited for Akane to show some repulsion with concealed nervousness.<p>"So you found other girls sexy, a lot of girls do without being that<br/>way," Akane said calmly. She decided Ranma-chan's life choice was<br/>mostly based on not having other girls around to be able to tell her<br/>it was normal.<p>"Yeah, well, there's more to it than that. . ." Ranma-chan started.<br/>She knew the usual arguments, her own mother had made most of them.<br/>She knew what she was, and she had come to terms with it already.<p>"Okay then I have a question for you," Akane said. "How come you<br/>haven't made a pass at me then?" Akane was more nervous about what<br/>the answer was going to be then she thought she should be.<p>"Who says I haven't, " Ranma-chan said with a straight face, still<br/>relaxing with her eyes closed. "We slept together last night, and<br/>we're bathing together in the nude. I'd say those were pretty big<br/>passes, wouldn't you?" Ranma-chan put a playful smile on her face as<br/>she said that.<p>Akane started to get self-conscious at what Ranma-chan had just<br/>suggested, then she realized there was a few problems with what was<br/>said. "Ranma, you wouldn't agree to sleep in the same bed with me<br/>until I suggested we use separate blankets," Akane pointed out. "And<br/>you acted more than a little shy when I asked you to wash my back a<br/>few minutes ago."<p>"I didn't want to scare you off, I don't have many friends, and even<br/>less who are girls,"Ranma-chan said with embarrassment.<p>"Why not?" Akane asked with concern.<p>"Well, I couldn't exactly get close to my fellow classmates for fear<br/>they would find out that I was actually a girl," Ranma-chan replied<br/>to the question. "And the few girls I knew either tried to use me to<br/>meet the other guys at my school , or tried to date me which would<br/>have blown my cover," she added in a depressed tone.<p>"Well, that won't happen here," Akane said firmly. "I'll introduce<br/>you to my friends, they're nice girls, and you'll see things will be<br/>different."<p>"Yeah, sure, till it rains on me and I become a guy, then I'll be<br/>the freak of Nerima." Ranma-chan was depressed at her own words, but<br/>put on a fake smile to make it look like she was making a joke. Akane<br/>wasn't fooled.<p>-<p>A while later the entire family was at the table beginning their<br/>breakfast. Akane was thinking of a way of introducing Ranma-chan and<br/>her curse to her friends, so she almost missed what the two guests<br/>started to do.<p>"Are you ready, girl?" Genma asked with his chopsticks poised in the<br/>ready position.<p>"Anytime you are, Pop!" Ranma-chan replied mimicking her father's<br/>move.<p>"Right, GO!" Genma said loudly as he struck out with his hands at<br/>the food. Then both Saotomes attacked the food in a blinding display<br/>of speed. It was almost impossible to see their hands as the food<br/>disappeared. They both stopped when there was nothing left in their<br/>bowls or the area surrounding them. "Excellent breakfast, Kasumi,"<br/>Genma said as he sat back patting his stomach.<p>"Yeah, great food," Ranma-chan added. She noticed the stunned look<br/>on the others faces and became a little embarrassed. "Me and Pop do<br/>that when we're on training trips. Pop says it builds speed and lets<br/>us get back to training faster," she explained. "Mom won't let us do<br/>that at home cause she says it's too unlady-like, even from me."<p>"My, what energetic eaters," Kasumi said wondering if they had even<br/>tasted her cooking or were being polite.<p>"Yes, Kasumi, and we're big eaters too," Genma replied back with a<br/>wink.<p>"I'll remember that." Kasumi started thinking of the increased<br/>amount of food she'd have to cook and cringed inside, though outwards<br/>she gave a sweet smile.<p>-<p>"Are you going to wear that, Ranma?" Akane asked as she watched<br/>Ranma-chan put back on her red Chinese shirt and the black pants that<br/>went with them.<p>"Yeah, kinda have to. I can't wear a dress in case I change forms,"<br/>Ranma-chan answered as she smoothed out the shirt's wrinkles. "And my<br/>boy's uniform won't fit in my male form even though it was baggy to<br/>hide my curves."<p>"Well, I hope they don't give you too much of a hard time about it<br/>at school." Akane grabbed her bag and headed for the door, "I'll wait<br/>for you downstairs. Don't be too long cause I don't want to be late,"<br/>Akane said as she left the room.<p>A few minutes later Ranma-chan was leaving Akane's room when Nabiki<br/>met her at the door. "Ranma, I usually don't give out information for<br/>free, but this time I'm making an exception," Nabiki said with her<br/>usual calmness.<p>"Yeah, what is it?" Ranma-chan asked. She knew better than to pass<br/>up information that could be vital for her survival, but she didn't<br/>trust this girl. Unfortunely it showed on her face.<p>Nabiki took notice of the look of the wariness in Ranma-chan's<br/>expression and her opinion of the girl went up a notch. "Akane is<br/>going to be in a fight when she gets to school," She stated plainly<br/>and started to walk away.<p>"What!" Ranma-chan couldn't believe how calm Nabiki was when she<br/>knew her own sister was going into battle. "Who is she gonna fight?"<br/>she asked with concern.<p>Nabiki smiled at the girl over her shoulder, "I only give one<br/>freebie, so that information will cost you." She continued her way<br/>down the stairs as Ranma-chan stood there stunned.<p>When the state of shock wore off Ranma-chan ran down the stairs<br/>trying to catch Nabiki. At the bottom of the stairs she almost ran<br/>into Akane, who had come to see what was taking so long. "Oh good,<br/>you're ready. Here's your bag. Come on lets go," Akane said in rapid<br/>fire as she grabbed Ranma-chan's arm an headed to the door.<p>"Okay, Okay! I'm coming, " Ranma-chan said chuckling lightly. And<br/>the two headed to school.<p>As the two headed down the street Ranma-chan noticed the railing and<br/>smiled to herself. With little effort she leapt to the railing and<br/>started walking along it. Akane couldn't believe that Ranma-chan<br/>could walk such a narrow pole. "What are you doing, Ranma?"<p>"Balance practice," Ranma-chan replied.<p>After they continued on for a few minutes Ranma-chan decided she<br/>needed to deal with what Nabiki had mentioned earlier, so she jumped<br/>down beside Akane again. "Akane, who you gonna fight at school?"<p>"What!. . . Who told you?" Akane said in total surprise.<p>"Nabiki mentioned it to me before we left, but she wouldn't say who<br/>it was," Ranma-chan said thinking back to Nabiki's smile and<br/>shuttered. "Your sister is a. . . weird person," she added trying to<br/>be polite.<p>"I'm more worried how much she charged you. . . never mind I don't<br/>what to know," Akane said waving off her own thoughts. "You don't<br/>need to bother worrying about the fight, I do this every morning and<br/>I really don't have much problems." Akane tried sounding unconcerned<br/>about the situation but Ranma-chan wasn't buying it.<p>"Listen. . ." Ranma-chan started but never finished as he was now wet.<p>"Oh! I'm so sorry," an old lady who was standing near by said<br/>quickly as she noticed she had splashed someone while watering the<br/>sidewalk.<p>"It's not your fault, I should have seen it coming," Ranma-kun<br/>return to the woman with a bow. Akane was trying hard to suppress a<br/>laugh watching her annoyed friend trying to be polite. Ranma-kun on<br/>the other hand was now worried about school. "Oh great, now what am I<br/>gonna do, I can't go to school like this," Ranma-kun said to Akane<br/>after they had moved away from the old lady.<p>"I'll take you to Dr. Tofu's office, it's on the way and we can get<br/>some hot water there," Akane replied back. Ranma-kun noticed the odd<br/>look in Akane's eyes as she mentioned the doctor.<p>The pair reached the office in only a few minutes as it was indeed<br/>close<br/>to where they had been. Ranma-kun liked the look of the little<br/>clinic, it seemed warm and friendly. He was waiting for Akane to come<br/>back with the hot water that she had disappeared though a inner door<br/>to get. He started to hum to himself, and this caused him to miss the<br/>boney little hand creeping towards him. He jumped when it landed on<br/>his shoulder, he spun to face a tall man wearing a gi and glasses,<br/>carrying a skeleton. "Watcha do that for!" he said trying to catch<br/>his breath.<p>"I'm sorry, I thought I should meet my new visitor in a fun way,"<br/>the man said with a smile.<p>Ranma-kun gave the man a look that said 'you're weird' as Akane came<br/>back into the room carrying a kettle. "Oh Dr. Tofu. . . I see you met<br/>Ranma," Akane said looking down and fiddling her thumbs in<br/>embrassment.<p>Ranma-kun looked at Akane, then smiled as he poured the hot water on<br/>herself.<p>"Why yes, I was just introducing myself to him. . . Um, her?"<br/>replied, readjusting his glasses as he gave Ranma-chan<br/>another look. "Hmm, time to get new glasses."<p>Ranma-chan looked depressed, she was sure the doctor would find her<br/>a freak. "I have a Jusenkyo curse that makes me a guy when cold water<br/>is poured on me," She said nervously.<p>"Jusenkyo, you don't say, I've heard of the place but never met a<br/>victim before," Dr. Tofu said with a smile.<p>"Trust me, it's not fun," Ranma-chan said weakly.<p>"I believe that's the point of curses," Dr. Tofu stated trying to be<br/>helpful.<p>"I've been confused about something, I thought you'd be happy<br/>becoming the son your father always wanted," Akane said to her friend<br/>then regretted it when she saw the look on Ranma-chan's face.<p>"I wanted him to be proud of me as I am, a girl who was as tough as<br/>any son he could ever trained," Ranma-chan stated in fierce<br/>seriousness. "I've trained as hard as I could with the limited time<br/>Mom lets me go on training trip, just to prove that I'm not the<br/>disappointment he originally thought I was."<p>"I'm sure your father doesn't think of you with disappointment,"<br/>Akane said trying to comfort Ranma-chan.<p>"Well girls, I believe you're going to be late if you stay here any<br/>longer, come back later and we'll talk some more," Dr. Tofu stated.<br/>He still had a smile on his face as he led them to the door.<p>-<p>The pair had been quiet for a couple of blocks, as the school's<br/>gates became visible Ranma-chan decided she should ask Akane about<br/>the Doctor before they got any farther. "So you really like that<br/>Doctor, huh?" she asked, trying hard to keep the sly grin off her<br/>face.<p>"Oh yes, Dr. Tofu has been treating our family for several years<br/>now, he's a very good doctor," Akane replied with a dreamy look in<br/>her eyes.<p>"Oh man, you've got a crush on him!" Ranma-chan said with a little<br/>laugh.<p>"So what if I do!" Akane clenched her fists and turned on her<br/>friend very angry. She couldn't believe Ranma-chan could be so cruel.<p>"Hey, hey, I was only having a little fun," Ranma-chan said smiling,<br/>waving her hands in front of her. "I thought you didn't like guys?"<p>"BOYS!" Akane nearly screamed, then look at the time on the school's<br/>clock. She was going to be late. She decided the only way to get in<br/>the school on time was to pshyc herself, clenching her fists she drew<br/>on all the rage she could muster and started her mantra "I HATE<br/>BOYS!, I REALLY HATE BOYS!" She started to run at the school<br/>chanting, "I HATE BOYS!" over and over.<p>Ranma-chan followed not understanding what she was going on about<br/>until a mass of boys in sports gear became visible inside the school<br/>grounds. She watched as the boys all tried to attack Akane, and<br/>noticed that none of them had a chance against her friend. One by<br/>one, and two by two they all were knocked down by Akane's blows.<br/>Ranma-chan was impressed by Akane's strength and stamina, but decided<br/>that she still needed work in dexterity and finesse.<p>Akane had finished in record time, she was going to make it to class<br/>on time after all. She stood there trying to catch her breath when<br/>the projectile came at her. Akane was about to catch it when a blur<br/>stepped in front of her. She was shocked when she saw Ranma-chan<br/>moved to intercept what was thrown at her.<p>"Someone is very careless to be throwing roses around," Ranma-chan<br/>said in disgust.<p>Akane looked down and put a hand to her forehead in depression.<br/>"Kuno," was all she could say.<p>"As is the setting sun a moment of rare beauty, so is but a minute<br/>with my love, Akane Tendo," said a tall boy in kendo clothes,<br/>minus the armour. He walked forward with an air of pure arrogance,<br/>moving his bokken to point at the pair of girls in the middle of the<br/>destruction. "Akane Tendo, these peasants thought to win your favour<br/>by combat, but all pale before your skill. I alone shall rise above<br/>their failure and be successful, I chall. . . hello, and who are<br/>you?" the boy asked Ranma-chan as he finally noticed that his prey<br/>was being protected by another.<p>"Are you alright, Akane?" Ranma-chan asked with concern, seeing the<br/>cringing that her friend was doing. "If you had told me you did your<br/>morning training at school I could have asked to join in, it looked<br/>like fun."<p>"FUN!. . . wait, you think that was training?" Akane asked in<br/>confusion.<p>"Yeah, of course, why else have a bunch of guys attack you?" Ranma-<br/>chan said as if it was obvious.<p>"Excuse me. . ." the boy with the bokken said trying to get their<br/>attention.<p>"Look, I'll explain it later, we're going to be late," Akane said<br/>shaking her head in disbelief. She didn't understand how Ranma-chan<br/>could think she would want a bunch of boys attacking her each morning.<p>"EXCUSE ME!" The boy yelled at the top of his voice. "We are not<br/>done, Akane Tendo. Unless you wish to forfeit my challenge and agree<br/>to date with me."<p>"Um, Akane, who's the guy with the stick?" Ranma-chan asked as she<br/>turned and looked at the Kendoist.<p>"That is Upperclassman Kuno," Akane replied starting to move around<br/>Ranma-chan. "I don't want to date you, Kuno. Why can't you understand<br/>that," she said in anger.<p>"Ah, Although your voice says no, I know the soul is willing, give<br/>up this facade and agree to date with me," Kuno said with a arrogant<br/>smile.<p>Ranma-chan stepped between them trying to block Kuno from getting<br/>any closer to Akane. "Listen buddy, I don't know who you are but she<br/>told you to get lost," she said with a hint of anger in her voice.<p>"Ah, I see, the vision of gracefulness before me also wishes to date<br/>with me," Kuno said with sneer on his face. "Though to be fair to the<br/>beauteous Akane Tendo you must defeat me in battle first, but be<br/>warned I am prepared to lose." He moved back and pointed the bokken<br/>in a rising motion.<p>"There's no way I would want to date you, but if you want to<br/>challenge me you got it!" Ranma-chan said as she got into a ready<br/>stance.<p>"Yes, a challenge it is, but first I shall have the name of the<br/>fiery tigress so I may know who it is I am to date," Kuno said with<br/>dripping arrogance.<p>"I'm Ranma Saotome, heir to the Saotome School of Anything-Goes<br/>Martial Arts," Ranma-chan said proudly. "And I told you I don't want<br/>to date you!"<p>"Ranma? Isn't that a boy's name, and you are most definently a girl,<br/>a strong looking one, but a girl none the less," Kuno said in<br/>confusion.<p>"My Pop wanted a boy, you got a problem with that?" Ranma-chan said<br/>in annoyance.<p>"As I have no control over your parents choice of name for you, I<br/>can have no reasonable problems for they would be as pointless as my<br/>words of comfort to you for having such a name," Kuno answered trying<br/>to look sagely.<p>"Huh?" Ranma-chan looked stunned for a moment then turned to Akane.<br/>"Did you understand that?" she asked hoping that Akane might be able<br/>to tell her if she had been insulted.<p>"Not a word of it, Ranma," Akane said. She looked just as confused<br/>as everyone else.<p>"Never mind, this isn't getting us anywhere," Kuno said firmly. "I<br/>am the raising young star of the Kendo world, the Blue Thunder of<br/>Furinkin High, Tatewaki Kuno age 17." As he said his speech lightning<br/>flashed behind him at the most appropriate moments.<p>Ranma-chan blinked several times then turned to Akane. "Is this guy<br/>for real?" she asked in disbelief.<p>"He's always like this," Akane answered grimly. "He gets worse if<br/>he's trying to go out with you."<p>"Excuse me, my twin beauties, but there is a challenge here and any<br/>more delays would be a slight to my honour," Kuno said calmly.<p>"Fine, if you want to be kicked around that badly," Ranma-chan said<br/>as she got into stance.<p>Kuno suddenly sprinted forward and brought his sword down in a<br/>lightning quick swing, Unfortunely for him Ranma-chan as already<br/>behind him. Ranma-chan spun on one heel as she gave Kuno a kick to<br/>the small of the back. Kuno stumbled a few steps but regained his<br/>balance quickly and turned to face his opponent, "Impressive, you are<br/>truly and tigress in motion."<p>"Whatever," Ranma-chan responded as she stepped into Kuno and gave<br/>him several punches to his chest. She hit every vital point she could<br/>to end the fight quickly.<p>Lightning flashed again.<p>Kuno stood there looking unfazed, but he also didn't move as a light<br/>rain started fall on his head. Ranma-kun on the other hand dashed for<br/>the closest building as fast as he could and hid from the school<br/>population. He heard the school bells as he hunched down next to the<br/>gym mats. This was not a good start to his school year.<p>-<p>"I can't believe we were late, it only took a minute to beat that<br/>wind bag," Ranma-chan in annoyance. She and Akane sat under a nice<br/>shady tree eating their lunch, enjoying a nice sunny afternoon.<p>"If you hadn't changed we could have been on time, but getting you<br/>some hot water took some time," Akane replied to her friend<br/>playfully. Akane didn't mind being late this time, seeing Kuno<br/>getting pounded on was well worth it. "I just hope he doesn't get<br/>fixated on you like he did on me after the first time I beat him,"<br/>she said with concern.<p>"Yeah, I still can't believe he's responsible for those morning<br/>attacks. I can see why you were so mad at me when I first showed up,"<br/>Ranma-chan said. She could understand why Akane hated boys if they<br/>kept attacking her for the prize of dating her. Ranma-chan, herself,<br/>would enjoy that kind of exercise knowing full well they would never<br/>come close to defeating her.<p>"Well, Um, That wasn't the only reason and you know it. We've talked<br/>about it<p>Two girls walked up to Akane, both were smiling but looked unsure of<br/>Ranma-chan. "Hi Akane, who's your new friend?" asked one of the girls<br/>who approached.<p>"Oh hi," Akane said looking up at her old friends. "This is Ranma,<br/>she's. . . ah, staying with my family for a while," Akane said as<br/>Ranma-chan gave the girls a weak smile.<p>"Hi, I'm Sayuri and this is Yuka," Sayuri said cheerfully as she<br/>pointed out her friend. "We've been friends with Akane since we were<br/>real little."<p>"Yeah, and the only girls not mad at me for having most of the<br/>school's male population chasing me." Akane said under her breath in<br/>a depressed tone. She decided not to ruin the introductions so she<br/>looked up with a happy look on her face. No one there were fooled.<p>"So Ranma, you transferred to this school a little late. . ." Yuka<br/>started to ask, trying to change the mood.<p>"Um, yeah, Me and Pop got back from our trip to China a little later<br/>then we expected," Ranma-chan replied. She tried to smile but it was<br/>still weak.<p>"You went to China? Wow how exciting, I never get to go<br/>anywhere,"Sayuri stated looking jealous.<p>"Yeah well, it's a trip I wish I had missed," Ranma-chan said in<br/>depression. "It was a very bad idea from the beginning, and it kept<br/>getting worse."<p>"Why, what happened?" Yuka asked in interest.<p>Akane decided that there had been enough questions and directed her<br/>friends up and away from Ranma-chan, "I'll be right back, Ranma."<br/>When she got far enough away from Ranma-chan's hearing she turned to<br/>her other friends. "Look, Ranma has had it rough the last few months,<br/>could you two please not ask about China for awhile?" Akane asked<br/>almost pleading.<p>"Why? I don't understand. . ." Sayuri started looking confused then<br/>she went wide-eyed and whispered, " wait you don't mean. . ."<p>Akane started waving her hands in front of herself, and a large<br/>sweat bead on her forehead, "No, no. . . nothing like that." Akane<br/>was having problem figuring out how to approach this subject. "Look,<br/>why don't you come over tomorrow night and I'll try to convince Ranma<br/>to explain. . . but you have to promise not to treat her like a<br/>freak, ok?" she asked quickly.<p>"Um, okay Akane, we'll come over, " Sayuri said as Yuka nodded in<br/>agreement. They both took their leave discussing what Akane was<br/>hiding about Ranma-chan that could make them think she was a freak.<p>"So, your friends don't like me do they?" Ranma-chan asked Akane<br/>when she got back.<p>"No, nothing like that," Akane replied quickly. "Look Ranma, they<br/>want to be your friend, but I think they should know about your curse<br/>first."<p>"Oh yeah that would help things," Ranma-chan said sarcastically.<br/>"When they run away screaming don't forget I warned you."<p>"I won't be that bad," Akane scolded her friend. "Look, I was able<br/>to accept you and I know them, they will too."<p>Ranma-chan still didn't like it but she trusted Akane, "So when do<br/>you want to show them?"<p>"Tomorrow night, I invited them to a sleep over," Akane replied as<br/>she continued her meal.<p>"That soon," Ranma-chan said quietly with a cringe.<p>-<p>"Nabiki Tendo, I want you," Kuno said as he stood with his shadow<br/>overlapping the girl in question.<p>"Oh Kuno, I had no idea. . ." Nabiki replied with both hands to the<br/>sides of her face which gave a faux blush. The other girls around her<br/>made giggling sounds.<p>"NOT like that, Nabiki Tendo," Kuno said quickly. "I have no<br/>interest in you."<p>Nabiki stood up giggling, "I know Kuno." She dusted herself off and<br/>straightened her skirt. "Couldn't you wait until tomorrow when we<br/>usually meet?" she ask in annoyance as she didn't have his pictures<br/>on her at the moment. Her last statement evoked the other girls to<br/>start whispering amongst themselves as Nabiki led Kuno away.<p>"I wish information about a beautiful red-haired vixen that I<br/>understand is staying at your house," Kuno said trying to be his most<br/>noble in stance and attitude. Inside he was all in turmoil over this<br/>new girl in his life.<p>"You mean Ranma?" Nabiki asked innocently, she could see yen signs<br/>starting to dance around Kuno's head.<p>"Yes, that was what she said her name was, it's such an odd name for<br/>such a beautiful girl, I. . ." Kuno replied, starting to go into one<br/>of his rants.<p>Nabiki put a stop to it quickly for her own sanity's sake, "What do<br/>you want to know Kuno, and remember it'll cost you."<p>"Add it to what you'll charge me tomorrow. I wish to know as much as<br/>you know," Kuno responded, he knew how Nabiki usually did business. "<br/>I wish to know her likes and dislikes, and all the usual things a man<br/>could use to date such a creature of wonder."<p>"Um, listen Kuno. . . how about we hold off a bit on this, I. . .<br/>um, need time to find out more about her. She only came to our house<br/>last night," Nabiki said stumbling over her words. She just had a<br/>very unusual reaction, she was actually concerned about siccing this<br/>loon on a girl her hardly knew. She suddenly felt protective of Ranma-<br/>chan and she didn't like the feeling.<p>"I am willing to wait, but not long. Gather you information and have<br/>it ready soon, I will pay you handsomely for all you can give me,"<br/>Kuno stated. He had a hard time believing what he was seeing, Nabiki<br/>Tendo, a girl who would sell her own sister, was having a moral<br/>dilemma about a girl she hardly knew. Even he was able to see it on<br/>her face, and he knew he could be more than a little dense<br/>sometimes, he usually hid it with arrogance to fool the peasants.<p>Nabiki got herself under control again, then she decided to find out<br/>if she had lost her regular income from him,"Um, okay. Are you giving<br/>up on my sister?"<p>Kuno stopped for a moment. "Your sister. . ." he said in a small<br/>voice. Images of Akane started to flash into his mind of his first<br/>love, each one pushed him closer and closer to the edge. "NO! Of<br/>course I haven't stopped loving your sister, bring yourself to the<br/>usual meeting place tomorrow," he said in a bold voice as he turned<br/>and walked away.<p>Nabiki watched him leave, she just shook his head and thought,<br/>*IDIOT!* Then she smiled and said in a quiet voice, "But a rich<br/>idiot."<p>-<p>School was just letting out and many students were making their<br/>escape as quickly as humanly possible, one of the students had no<br/>intention of leaving and was standing at the main gates as if a<br/>guardian.<p>Kuno watched the crowd coming out of the buildings, searching for<br/>his target. He moved his eyes over the people and almost missed Akane<br/>as she and an unknown boy were coming out of the main building. Not<br/>seeing his fiery tigress he decided to deal with this cur that had<br/>the gall to walk with his woman.<p>Akane was still giggling as Ranma-kun was resetting his clothes,<br/>they had been coming down the stairs as a bucket of the janitors<br/>mopping water had been knocked over. Luckily no one else was around,<br/>mostly due to the fact both girls had been late getting out.<br/>"You know you wouldn't have been in the right place at the right<br/>time for that one if you hadn't had that argument with the teacher,"<br/>Akane said as she wiped away tears of laughter from her eyes.<p>"But she was wrong on her pronunciation of that word, it was 'hair'<br/>not 'hear'," Ranma-kun said in annoyance. "Besides the water would<br/>have waited for me, it always does."<p>"So, how do you know so much about languages? First you say you know<br/>Chinese, and now I find out you are almost fluent in American<br/>english," Akane said in amazement.<p>"British," Ranma-kun corrected. "Mom sorta demanded I learn other<br/>languages. I learned Chinese cause Pop warned me that we'd be going<br/>to China as soon as he could convince Mom, as for english. . . that<br/>was Mom's idea."<p>"Why?" Akane said in agitation. She hated when Ranma-kun stopped<br/>explaining in the middle of an answer. She was starting to think that<br/>Ranma-kun was doing it for dramatic pause, but it was driving her<br/>nuts.<p>"Mom knew I wasn't gonna be a traditional girl and she figured I'd<br/>probably go into the business world some day, she didn't think I<br/>would bother running a dojo. So she sent me to a tutor to learn<br/>English so I could deal with the business world," Ranma-kun said in<br/>long explanation. "She never had much confidence in Pop being a good<br/>teacher of the Arts, she changed her mind a couple of years ago so<br/>she doesn't bug me about all the time I spend training anymore."<p>"She wanted you to become another Nabiki?" Akane said with a shiver.<br/>"One of her is enough!" Akane still didn't understand one thing,<br/>"Why 'British' and not 'American' english?"<p>"The tutor Mom sent me to was British and she taught me what she<br/>called 'Proper English'," Ranma-kun finished her explanation.<p>"Okay," Akane said with a shrug. "So you wanted to get a snack<br/>before going home?"<p>"YOU THERE CUR! GET YOUR HAND AWAY FROM AKANE TENDO!" came a<br/>bellow from the direction the school gates.<p>Akane hung her head and placed a hand to her forehead in support,<br/>"Kuno."<p>All the students who were leaving turned to look at what Kuno was<br/>yelling at. What they saw was almost as amazing to them as it was<br/>maddening to Kuno. There was a boy with Akane, he was carrying her<br/>bag, and they were holding HANDS!. The rumours started instantly.<p>Kuno came running up to the pair in a rage. "I said Get. Your. Hand.<br/>Away. From. Akane. Tendo!" he punctuated each word as he drew his<br/>bokken and pointed it at the unknown boy.<p>"Calm down Kuno," Ranma-kun said in reply. He shifted the bags off<br/>his shoulders in a smooth motion.<p>"That's Upperclassman Kuno to you!" Kuno said in his usual<br/>arrogance. "And exactly how did you know my name?" Kuno added. Ranma-<br/>kun was about to say something but Kuno cut him off, "No doubt you<br/>had heard of my magifiance. My fame as the raising star of the Kendo<br/>world proceeds me."<p>"You are so full of yourself!" Ranma-kun said fully annoyed. He was<br/>getting angry at the idiot in front of him, wasn't one defeat in a<br/>day enough for this guy? He let go of Akane's hand and gave her the<br/>bags without saying another word, then he got into stance.<p>Kuno couldn't remember where he had seen that form before, but he<br/>had and it was recently. "I have no mercy for those who push<br/>themselves unwantedly on young girls," Kuno said trying to sound<br/>noble.<p>"So you must not like yourself much then?" Ranma-kun said with a<br/>cocky smile. He launched his attack first to throw off the Kendoist's<br/>stride.<p>Kuno saw it coming and parried it with his bokken, then struck out<br/>in a thrust attack. "You jest at the moment of your own demise?"<p>The two continued for many attacks and counter-attacks, mostly it<br/>was Ranma-kun dodging the ever increasing speed of Kuno's bokken.<br/>Ranma-kun moved to the side as one downward swing came in stronger<br/>than the others, it hit the school wall and left a crevice large<br/>enough for several students to walk through. He saw another swing<br/>coming from the side. Ranma-kun dodged the blade with ease, but the<br/>air pressure left him feeling like one of his father's punches had<br/>gotten through his defences. He couldn't believe that Kuno had this<br/>much skill, their earlier fight went way too easy compared to this.<br/>"Ok, no more jokes," Ranma-kun said calmly, all mirth had left him.<br/>He started a new fighting pattern designed to move around a weapon<br/>and to strike his opponent multiple times in vital locations.<p>Kuno blocked many of his opponent's attacks and dodged a few more,<br/>but too many got through and his arms and legs had gone numb. It was<br/>a familiar sensation. He was starting to fall to the ground when his<br/>weight was suddenly supported by the boy, then put gently to the<br/>ground. Who ever the cur was he had a sense of honour that Kuno could<br/>have respected if it wasn't for the boy's advances on Kuno's love,<br/>Akane.<p>"You just lay there for a while, you'll get the feeling back in<br/>about an hour," Ranma-kun informed the Kendoist after placing him on<br/>the ground. He moved back and grabbed Akane's hand then started to<br/>pull her out of the schoolyard, "Come on Akane, let's get out of<br/>here."<p>Akane had been too wrapped up in the fight, seeing again how smooth<br/>and graceful all Ranma-kun's movement's were, that she didn't even<br/>realize the fight was over. She really wanted to be able to fight<br/>like that. Then she was snapped out of it when Ranma-kun grabbed her<br/>hand and started pulling her out the main gates.<p>-<p>The two sat in Dr. Tofu's examination room, waiting for the Doctor<br/>to come back with some hot water. Ranma-kun looked around the room<br/>for a minute or so then turned back to Akane, "Is  a general<br/>practioner?"<p>"Well, he specializes in Chiropractic and herbal medicines but he<br/>also does general medicine for some families," Akane answered as she<br/>watched the door eagerly. "We use to come to him for everything."<p>"Yes, until a couple of years ago I handled all the Tendo's medical<br/>concerns, but the girls grew up a bit and became uncomfortable a man<br/>checking some things,"  offered with a smile as he came into<br/>the room with a kettle.<p>Akane blushed and turned her head away as he mentioned the last<br/>part. Ranma-kun giggled at his friend's shyness, then poured the<br/>water on herself. She came to a decision and looked up at the Doctor,<br/>"I glad to hear you handle all medical concerns. I need a doctor for<br/>womanly check ups, and I would feel more comfortable with you doing<br/>those since you know about the curse. If you are willing to take on a<br/>new patient."<p>Akane looked at her friend a little shocked by how easily Ranma-chan<br/>could discuss such things with a man. She, herself, stopped coming to<br/>out of embrassment of having a man even coming close to<br/>looking there, especially someone she really liked.<p>sat down and took on a professional appearance, "I don't see<br/>why not. It would be interesting to see what your curse has done to<br/>your development, but most girls your age prefer a woman doctor to<br/>deal with those concerns."<p>"I really don't want another doctor knowing about the curse, too<br/>much chance that they'd use me like a test subject. And actually I<br/>would be more embrassed by a woman checking me down there. . . for<br/>personal reasons," Ranma-chan explained with a small blush of her own.<p>Akane coughed into her hand in a knee jerk reaction to the last part<br/>of Ranma-chan's statement.  gave Akane a curious look then<br/>turned back to Ranma-chan, "I'd be honoured. You know Nabiki is the<br/>only Tendo girl who still comes to me for those services,"<p>"That's because you give us a cut family rate and she's more<br/>concerned with money than embrassment," Akane said as if it was the<br/>most obvious thing in the world.<p>"So when would you like to set up an appointment?"  asked in<br/>his professional tone.<p>"Well I haven't had a check up since before going to China, so I<br/>should have one soon cause of the change in my body," Ranma-chan said<br/>calmly trying to make it sound as if the curse no longer bothered<br/>her. "How about Monday after school?<p>"I don't have any major appointment at that time so it should be<br/>fine,"  replied.<p>-<p>Unlike her new friend who fell asleep as soon as her head hit the<br/>pillow, Akane lay in bed unable to sleep, it had been an interesting<br/>day. Her new friend was surprising in so many ways. Ranma-chan could<br/>be very bold one moment, but also very shy the next. Her and her<br/>father were so very skilled yet she didn't make a big deal about it,<br/>as if it was just natural, she even offered to teach Akane some of<br/>the moves she used against Kuno.<p>She looked over at Ranma-chan's sleeping body and sighed, *I hope<br/>Yuka and Sayuri don't get freaked out by her curse, she could use<br/>some more friends.* Akane sudden noticed that Ranma-chan was mumbling<br/>in her sleep, but she couldn't make out what was being said. She gave<br/>Ranma-chan a small kiss on the cheek and said in a quite voice, "see<br/>you in the morning." She then decided to just lay back and try to<br/>finally get some sleep and after a time sleep did catch up with her.<p>-<p>Ranma found himself in the mists again, he didn't see the screen<br/>like last time so he moved on a bit. Finally he found what he was<br/>looking for, and saw Akane give a small kiss to his alternate half.<br/>He smiled for a moment before depression set in, "Akane would never<br/>do that with me."<p>"Not with the way thing are between you two, but this Akane was just<br/>giving a kiss to her friend in comfort," said an unfamiliar voice<br/>behind him.<p>Ranma spun as fast as he could to face the owner of the voice, only<br/>to find a woman standing there. She looked a little like Kasumi, or<br/>even Akane, but older. "Um, who're you? And where's the old man?"<br/>Ranma asked in confusion.<p>"We decided that you should meet some of the others," the woman<br/>replied sweetly. "Don't worry I can answer you questions just as<br/>easily as he could."<p>"Um, okay," Ranma responded, then turned back to the screen. "It was<br/>a busy day wasn't it," he said to himself as he looked at the<br/>sleeping girls.<p>Ranma turned away from the screen after a few moments and looked at<br/>the woman again, "Okay, I guess I should start while I can. Me and<br/>Pop seem to have a better relationship. . . why?"<p>The woman smiled at Ranma, "You and your father weren't on the road<br/>alone as much, and he couldn't bring himself to teach you any<br/>insanely stupid styles. He also tried to make the time you two spent<br/>together very special so you two would be closer."<p>"He didn't teach me any of the insane styles. . . you mean like the<br/>Neko-ken?" Ranma asked in amazement. "Yeah I guess we would have a<br/>better relationship then, that training was when I first started to<br/>realize he cared more about training me than about me."<p>"That was a very impressive realization for a 6 year old to make,"<br/>the woman stated calmly. "He couldn't bring himself to do that to a<br/>little girl, and he was also worried what your mother would do to him<br/>if she found out," she continued looking annoyed about something.<p>"I can understand that. I'm more shocked he actually was working,<br/>even if it was as a Phys. Ed. Instructor. . . doesn't that require a<br/>college degree?" Ranma asked as he realized some things didn't add up.<p>"Your mother pushed him into getting a degree saying if he was ever<br/>going to be taken seriously as a dojo master he was going to have one<br/>to prove he had the skills to teach," she said proudly then added<br/>with a hint of sadness, "I wish someone else could have seen things<br/>that way, but some people are more stubborn then others."<p>"You don't need a piece of paper to prove you can teach, " Ranma<br/>said in annoyance.<p>"You do if you want to get a loan to start a dojo, " the woman<br/>responded. "But he didn't really want a dojo, he just wanted to make<br/>your mother happy. She's the one who convinced him to take a teaching<br/>job."<p>"Trying to make mom happy? That doesn't sound like the Pop I know,<br/>but I guess having to spend so much time with her changed him too,"<br/>Ranma said with a smile. "Not that I'm complaining," he added quickly.<p>"Okay, it seems like I'm going to have the same problems with Kuno,<br/>but I guess I should have expected that," Ranma said to himself.<br/>"Akane has always been happy to hide my curse from other people,<br/>mostly out of embrassment about being engaged to a freak, why is she<br/>trying to tell her best friends about it here?" he asked in<br/>confusement.<p>"She isn't so much embrassed about it as she's embrassed about how<br/>she feels about it. Here she wants you to have as many friends as you<br/>can so you don't feel like such a outsider like you described your<br/>life was like before," the woman said with pride in her voice. She<br/>looked at the screen with a expression of longing that almost ripped<br/>Ranma's heart out in concern. "She does love you, you know."<p>"I wish I could be sure of that back home, but I guess I'll never<br/>find out," Ranma said, depressed by the thought of never seeing his<br/>Akane again. "I guess I have to make do with this version if I can."<p>"As you've been told she is the same Akane in everyway as the one<br/>you already know, she's just reacting differently to different<br/>situations put before her," the woman reminded him of prior<br/>conversations.<p>"I have a weird question. . . what womanly concerns? I mean the ones<br/>mentioned at 's office," Ranma asked not sure if he really<br/>wanted an answer or not.<p>The woman chuckled slightly, "I surprised you don't know already,<br/>but I'm sure you'll find out soon enough."<p>"Um, sure," Ranma replied. He figured he wouldn't get a straight<br/>answer about that, but he had to ask. He turned back to the screen<br/>and looked at the two girls sleeping then asked, "Am I going to be<br/>doing this every night?"<p>The woman moved up to stand beside him and also watched the screen,<br/>the look of longing was on her face again. "No, only when important<br/>things happen in your life which you need some answers about. The<br/>first little while this will happen more often as you are just<br/>beginning your new adventure, but as time goes on you'll come here<br/>less and less," the woman explained.<p>Ranma looked over the woman and saw the happiness and the pain that<br/>she had on her face as she looked at the screen. "You're her mother,<br/>Kimiko, aren't you?" He asked as it dawned on him why she looked<br/>familiar.<p>"Yes," Kimiko replied not taking her eyes off of the screen. "I'm<br/>sorry, I haven't seen my little one for some time and I was<br/>distracted," she said shaking her self out of the trance seeing Akane<br/>again had put her in. She looked at Ranma again and sighed, "I am<br/>supposed to be here to answer your questions and concerns."<p>"Don't worry, I don't have any pressing concerns right now, why<br/>don't you enjoy your time and I try to stay asleep as long as<br/>possible," Ranma said in a comforting tone.<p>"Thank you," Kimiko replied back as she turned back to the screen.<br/>"I can see why, even with all the other problems you brought with<br/>you, that she fell in love with you," she added as she watched her<br/>daughter sleeping.<p>The two just stood there for a long time watching the screen until<br/>finally the world started to fade again, and Ranma felt the pull that<br/>he had experienced before. "I guess our time is up, I hope I can do<br/>this for you again," Ranma said as the misty void disappeared.<p>
