</div> <b><u><p style="text-align:center;">Ranma and Akane Wake Up</p></u></b><i><p>Fit in the second: The Morning After</p><p>A Ranma crossover fanfic by </p></i><b>Z<i>o</i></b><u>r<b><i>k</i></b>n</u><b><i>o</i>t<p>Disclaimer:</p></b> Rumiko Takahashi owns Ranma. I'm taking quite a bit from Douglas Adams's <i>Hithhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>. I'm taking a little from Love Hina, a little from an obscure children's story I read ages ago, and far too much from Sailor Moon. Apologies to all I've offended. Now get over it.<b><p>Previously on RAWU:</p></b> Ranma and Akane suddenly woke up and figured out how to solve all their problems. They got married, ditched all of Ranma's fiancees and celebrated by going to a five star restaurant with a credit card. Unfortunately the five star restaurant was Milliways the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Hilarity ensues.<p>(further notes to follow fic)</p><p>Thank you for reading, share and enjoy,</p><p>~~~~~[START]~~~~~</p><p>If you have never been to Earth, consider yourself extremely lucky. It's not a particularly <i>bad</i> planet; in fact, some parts of it are quite nice. The problem is that it is populated by a race of absolute blithering idiots. These idiots are the bipedal, ape-descendents known to themselves as "humans."</p><p>It's estimated that almost half of the habitable worlds in the galaxy are, in fact, versions of the same blue-green planet with the dull name. The overwhelming number of Earths and, consequently, humans, is now widely theorized to be the reason why so many of the beings that populate the galaxy have two legs, two arms, one head, and speak in British accents. This new theory has made quite a lot of people upset, and quite a lot of people have been blamed, but most point to three races in particular as culprits to this completely unhoopy predicament.</p><p>The first is the humans themselves, for merely existing. There have been one or two individuals who have suggested deporting the humans to the Earths they came from or perhaps feeding them all to the Bugblatter Beast of Traal. However, humans do not take kindly to deportation attempts and the beings that acted on the latter suggestion were all eventually fed... to the Bugblatter Beast of Traal. Most non-human beings continue to do what they have done in the past, which is stay as far away from humans as possible and laugh whenever they do something stupid. There are quite a few, however, which are not as nice.</p><p>Vogons are one of these races. While it is true that they aren't especially nice to <i>any</i> race, they have a special hatred for Humans, as Vogons are the second race blamed for the plethora of Earths. In particular one Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz. He had sought to destroy the Earth in order to make way for a hyperspace bypass, but Earths kept reappearing in various locations in space-time for each one that was destroyed. So by the time Prostetnic had managed to destroy the nine or so Earths that were blocking the way of the bypass, thirty-three more were created which blocked <i>other</i> bypasses The problem had caused a resurgence of the Vogon version of science (which consisted of kidnapping groups of highly intelligent beings and ripping off body parts periodically until they figured out something) and consequently made their poetry the second worst in the galaxy, beating out the Azgoths by their in-depth descriptions of the anatomies of their audiences. It was Prostetnic's daughter, Shabon Vogon Spray, who finally found out what was going on. Shabon was a <i>particularly</i> enthusiastic poet and she had managed to incapacitate a good number of a certain race of hyper-intelligent Pan-dimensional beings, until finally, they revealed what they knew.</p><p>These beings, the Mice, are, of course, the third race blamed for Earth. After the first Earth was destroyed five minutes before it could come up with the question of Life the Universe and Everything, to which the answer is 42, they had decided to make a second. Being hyper-intelligent and pan-dimensional beings, they decided that this time they wouldn't just give Earth a mere four dimensions, this time they would give Earth <i>all</i> of them. Just as the small furry creatures with whiskers, large teeth and cheese fixations are the protrusion into our four dimensions of space-time of a race of humanoid pan-dimensional beings, so the Earths are merely the four dimensional analogs of a single pan-dimensional Earth. Each time a four-dimensional analog is destroyed the Earth warps, allowing more versions of it to appear in space-time, and thus we have the proliferation of Earths in the Galaxy.</p><p>The sale of pan-dimensional mousetraps has gone up considerably in the years since this was discovered. Of course these don't work at all, but they serve to send a message.</p><p>As the vastness of space makes all-out war a tricky business at best, the end result of all this knowledge is an increased level of antagonism in general, an increased awareness in the existence of other dimensions, and an increase in towels, which have served to balance the other two out.</p><p>Truly, if it weren't for towels, things would be pretty nasty indeed.</p><p>By a staggering coincidence one of the Earths that appeared as a result of Prostetnic's shenanigans was in fact better known as the legendary planet Mmagrathea ("Gamma Earth" if you take the trouble to unscramble the letters). Magrathea, spelled with only one 'm' by non-pedants, was in the business of large-scale custom planet building and is the birthplace of both the original Earth and the second. Which means that the Earth, in effect, created itself.</p><p>This is, of course, impossible.</p><p>What this also means is that the popular restaurant Milliways, located for all time on Magrathea, can exist and thrive due to the tear in the fabric of the space-time continuum caused by the time paradox. Using this tear it can exist at any place and any time it sees fit allowing its patrons to witness the very end of the universe as they dine.</p><p>This is, of course, impossible.</p><p>Finally, what this means is that Earthlings, particularly those sensitive to psychic phenomena, often come across Milliways, mistake it for a normal restaurant and enter. Consequently they are often neither seen nor heard from again. And so it is that Ranma, a seventeen-year-old male martial artist who has defeated a god and turns into a girl when splashed with cold water, and his wife, a seventeen-year-old female martial artist who can call large mallets into existence at will and has been turned into a small doll and back again at least twice, are now sitting at a table in Milliways having an argument over a glass of Nannichuan and non-yak urinated apple juice with a space cow on whether or not they should eat it.</p><p>This is, of course, impossible.</p><p>"It's quite simple," the space cow tried to explain, "Everyone was tired of the controversy of whether on not it was morally right to slaughter innocent creatures against their will. So they created me. I'm animal that WANTS to be eaten!" The creature stuffed a wad of lettuce into its mouth, gulped it down and smiled.</p><p>"But...but..." protested Akane, "you're smarter than an animal...you can talk!"</p><p>"Well of course I can talk!" the creature chortled through his lettuce, "How else could I let people know that it was okay to eat me?"</p><p>"It just ain't right!" Ranma declared, "Having somethin' come up ta ya and TELL ya ta eat it? That's just sick..."</p><p>The gluttonous space cow gave Ranma a baleful look through the folds of fat on his face. "You would rather kill a creature that DIDN'T want to be eaten?"</p><p>"That ain't the point!" Ranma argued.</p><p>The space cow grunted.</p><p>"Okay...maybe it IS the point. I don't care." Ranma crossed his arms and contemplated his apple juice. He was wondering idly through the confusion if there was some way to be sure that there was in fact no urine in the beverage.</p><p>Akane gave her own "drink" a cursory glance before asking, "Honestly, don't you want to keep living to experience all life has to offer?"</p><p>The creature snorted "Madam, I've had a good life, better than yours I imagine. Do you know why I bother to wake up every morning? I think to myself, one of these days, some one is going to eat me, and when they do I want them to say 'My what a good tasting meat!' and not be concerned that they consumed something that hadn't died of its own free will." The animal let out a somewhat frustrated noise that sounded like a cow doing a sheep impersonation. " I have learned to speak, listened to classical music, got a degree in Xenobiology and Xenopsychology, invented a new kind of plum sauce...all to make sure that I was that much more palatable to the beings that would eat me. And now you would deny me the pleasure of knowing that my life's work has not been in vain?"</p><p>Akane tilted her head in revelation. "You really want to be eaten don't you?"</p><p>The space cow nodded as he stuffed some more vegetables in his face.</p><p>Ranma put his glass up to his nose and sniffed. His eyebrows furrowed as he tried to detect the urine that might or might not be there. He set the glass down and looked at the Nannichuan water in front of Akane. "Are you going to drink that?" He was wondering what it would do if someone drank it. Did it matter?</p><p>"Perhaps sir or madam would like to order now?" the elderly waiter prodded. He had been standing patiently at Ranma and Akane's table all this time and was beginning to understand why that metal gentleman who worked in the car park was so depressed.</p><p>"I'll just have a salad thanks," Ranma replied.</p><p>"I know quite a few vegetables that would object to your choice sir," the dish of the day admonished.</p><p>"Oh yeah, well how come <i>you're</i> eatin them then?" Ranma countered.</p><p>"I assure you I eat only the most fatalistic and suicidal vegetables, Sir. Besides I hate the bastards. Don't have any class- whining about having too little sunlight, not enough water, fluctuating gravity levels... They just wait around for other people to do things to them. They never fully enjoy what life has to offer or try something different." The space cow put a pudgy hand/hoof on Ranma's shoulder: "They probably wouldn't be interested in a luscious, juicy, steak dinner in the least."</p><p>"Hey wait a minute!" Ranma got up off his chair, "Watch what yer sayin or I'll..."</p><p>"Kill me? Or perhaps you'd like to tenderize me a little?" The space cow grunted, "That's all been taken care already, Sir. Perhaps you'd enjoy a nice rump roast, I've been feeding myself lots of grain, that area should be tender and juicy by now..."</p><p>Akane looked up at the tired-looking waiter and handed him her menu: "We'll have two steak dinners, please."</p><p>"Very good, Madam," the waiter nodded respectfully to Akane as he took her menu.</p><p>"Akane!" Ranma's head whipped to his wife.</p><p>"What? I'm hungry." Akane giggled, "If we don't eat soon <i>you'll</i> start to look good."</p><p>Ranma sat back down. "That...ain't funny."</p><p>"Sir?" The waiter was waiting for Ranma to give him the menu.</p><p>"Yeah sure. What she said." Ranma handed his menu to the waiter, a blank expression on his face.</p><p>"Thank you both so very much for allowing me to be your meal. Do you plan on eating any brains this evening?</p><p>"NO!" Akane and Ranma yelled.</p><p>"Good. I won't have to worry about shooting me self in the head then. I'm told laser pulse bursts can ruin an otherwise delectable dish." And with that, the waiter wheeled the space cow off.</p><p>For a while both Akane and Ranma were silent. Every now and then one of them would fondle their glass. Ranma occasionally stared at the knife on the side of his plate. Finally Akane broke the silence with a percussive nervous laugh. "Honestly, Ranma you said yourself we're not in Nerima anymore. Well wherever we are, apparently the food talks to you."</p><p>Ranma pointed to Akane's glass. "You decided what ta do about that yet?"</p><p>Akane's eyes stayed on Ranma for a while then drifted down to the glass in front of her. "I think..." Her eye flicked back to Ranma, "I think I'm going to pour it on my head. It's just..." She looked off to the side...at a fat, pink, tentacled alien in a Hawaiian shirt swaying rhythmically to the music of the blue-skinned brass band... "I don't know if now is a good time or not."</p><p>"Yeah, I know what ya mean..." Ranma brushed a piece of lettuce off his shoulder. "Hey! I just remembered! When you turn into a guy, you're gonna get bigger'n stuff. It ain't gonna be to comfortable in that school uniform."</p><p>"That's right! But what can I do? I didn't bring a change of clothes, you know."</p><p>Ranma looked at his apple juice. He shrugged. Then he picked it up and splashed it in his face.</p><p>"Ranma! What are you doing?"</p><p>Ranma wiped her face with the dinner napkin and got up. She walked behind Akane and placed a thin graceful hand on her side, just above the waist. Akane felt Ranma's hand glide all the way down her uniform past her waist, down her thigh, stopping at her knee. Ranma could see the hairs on the back of Akane's neck rise in goose pimples. Ranma smiled. "That's a nice dress, can I talk you out of it?"</p><p>Milliways is a restaurant that serves (or to be perfectly accurate, served, serves and will serve) all manner of being. Many of these beings are leaders of super powerful star systems harboring great flotillas of warships and big, nasty weapons. It is thus integral, not only to the future (or rather, the proliferation <i>in</i> the future) of Milliways but the very Universe itself that the bathrooms are accommodating to <i>all</i> forms of life. Even stupid ones.</p><p>It is for this reason that the sign indicating the location of the restrooms consists of a fairly realistic picture of a steaming pile of dung. The area around the sign, in case a being does not have eyes, is fragrant with the smells of every known type of excrement. For those beings of a tactile persuasion the doors to each restroom have knobs that mimic the precise consistency and temperature of the feces to be found therein. If a being were to be of a mind to lick the door... that being would no doubt regret it. Smaller signs with sensory stimuli attuned to the brainwave patterns of beings in need of relief are placed along the walls to lead these beings to the correct area. All of this is done to make absolutely certain that it is as easy as possible for any being to find the appropriate restroom...at the appropriate time.</p><p>"So where is the bathroom?" Akane asked.</p><p>Ranma pointed to a doorway with a considerable amount of space around it. "I think that's it."</p><p>"Hmm? What makes you say that?"</p><p>"Uh, well...the sign kinda gave me a clue..." It hovered above the area in steaming, holographic realism.</p><p>"Oh I didn't even see that!"</p><p>"Jeez, Akane. Ya gotta be more obstinate."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Ya gotta be more obstinate." Akane gave Ranma a confused look. Ranma rephrased, "Ya gotta pay attention to things."</p><p>"Oh! You mean <i>observant</i>."</p><p>"Uh, yeah. Whatever." Ranma kissed Akane on the cheek. "Let's go. Bring your man juice."</p><p>Akane nodded and got to her feet with the Nannichuan. Together she and Ranma went onward, through the tables of dangerously jovial creatures, to the doors underneath the gigantic, glowing, revolving, and steaming pile of shit.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in Nerima, a two days had passed, and Nabiki was beginning to worry.</p><p>"I'm beginning to worry." She told Kasumi.</p><p>"Why's that, Nabiki-chan?" Kasumi asked.</p><p>"Well that whole business with Ranma and Akane...It all happened rather fast didn't it?"</p><p>"What makes you say that?" Kasumi was rifling through her closet as Nabiki sat on her bed. She was even more distracted than usual...which was saying something.</p><p>"A month ago, none of the stuff Ranma tried would have worked. I mean, every plan of his is lame brained to the extreme, but I suppose one of them would have had to work simply out of probability...but... all of them in one <i>day</i>" Nabiki picked up a book that was sitting on Kasumi's nightstand. <i>Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are</i> was the title. Nabiki looked at it a moment and then put it back down. "The Kodachi plan sure...I had a part in that, but why did that nonsense with Kuno work? The guy's an idiot with an obsession. They should never have been able to stop him!"</p><p>Kasumi pulled out a dress and smiled. "I'm happy for them."</p><p>"Well, sure. I am too...Ranma is <i>so</i> fun to tease, but he's okay. He's good for Akane...but that's just it!"</p><p>Kasumi undid her robe and put a blouse on over her bra, "What's just it, Nabiki-chan?" she asked as she was about to put on the skirt.</p><p>"They should be at each others throats! They should be tearing the walls down! They should be giving each other hell! And instead, before they left, they were kissing...and hugging...and laughing for no reason."</p><p>Kasumi finished dressing and started brushing her hair. "I don't see what the problem is yet."</p><p>"Kasumi, the last I saw them they were going to a five star restaurant...with a credit card. I can't remember why I gave them that credit card, but I did. It's been two days and they haven't come back yet."</p><p>Kasumi tied her hair and a bow, sat down at her vanity and started putting on her make up. "Oh you're just worried about them!" She said with a patented Kasumi smile.</p><p>"Maybe...But that makes me even <i>more</i> worried...about this other thing." Nabiki watched for a while as Kasumi carefully applied blush and eyeliner. Suddenly Nabiki realized that this was a little odd. "Kasumi? Are you going out?"</p><p>Kasumi took a moment to put the finishing touches on her make up and then stood up turning toward Nabiki. "Yes! How do I look?" She put her hands up to show herself. The dress was much more conservative than the current fashions but it was still striking. And of course there was Kasumi's smile.</p><p>"You look...good, 'neechan. Great even. Who's the lucky guy?"</p><p>"Why Tofu! He's back from his sabbatical in Okinawa and he wanted to see me!"</p><p>"Wow...that's great...great."</p><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><p>"Hmm? Oh no. Nothing's wrong. Nothing at all..." Now Nabiki was the distracted one.</p><p>Kasumi stood for a moment, waiting for Nabiki to say something else. When she didn't, Kasumi look of concern turned once more to a happy smile, "Well I'd better get going- Ono-kun will be here any minute." Kasumi opened the door to leave her room then she turned back toward Nabiki "Are you sure there's nothing wrong?"</p><p>"Yes..." Kasumi started to leave, "it's just..."</p><p>Kasumi stopped, "Yes?"</p><p>"It's just everything today, and even the past few weeks just seems so..."</p><p>There's a sound from downstairs. "Oh! That's Ono-kun! I have to go, Nabiki. You'll tell me about it later won't you?" Kasumi leaves and closes the door behind her.</p><p>Staring at the closed door, Nabiki heard Kasumi and Tofu exchange nervous pleasantries with each other, and then leave. There was no evidence of madness from the good doctor. After a few moments of silence Nabiki laid on her sister's bed and stared at the ceiling. "It's just...everything seems so damned...<i>waffy</i>."</p><p>"Aw Akane! What'dya do THAT for!"</p><p>"Baka! I couldn't help it! The smell..."</p><p>"Yeah, I know but did'ya have to puke all over ME?"</p><p>"It didn't get all <i>over</i> you it just got on your shoe," Akane pointed out. As she spoke, several cat-sized robots were busy vacuuming up the vomit. They seemed to be whistling an odd variation of the Star Spangled Banner. "You're SURE this is the restroom?" Akane asked for the third time.</p><p>The robots were giving Ranma bad vibes. She didn't want to stay out here any longer than she had to; so she held her breath and grabbed the doorknob. There was an audible <i>squish</i>. "Yeah, Akane..." she said as she let the air out of her mouth. "I'm sure this is the bathroom." After a moment of deliberation, Ranma turned the knob, which passed gas loudly in protest, and opened the door.</p><p>When going to a bathroom on an unfamiliar planet, spaceship, or five star restaurant, cleanliness is usually, but not always, the chief concern. For instance on the planet Regfue the bathrooms are absolutely crawling with dirt, slime and scum from beings coming from all parts of the universe. Regfue is the home of the filthiest bathrooms in the galaxy. Which isn't surprising, as the planet is also well known for it's Feng Shui Defragmentation Beans with Five Flavor Cheese sauce, so named because eating them is like having your entire digestive tract explode, and then having it put back together by a team of eclectic home decorators. However, due to the use of holographic projectors, scent negation machines, and hypnotic sound producers, the bathrooms appear to most to be sparkly clean, winter fresh, and almost absurdly comfortable. The fact that many leave the lavatory with several debilitating diseases is unimportant for those seeking a truly enjoyable defecation. Many beings have died in Regfue bathrooms, but they died happy, and no one else even notices they're there.</p><p>Conversely, the bathrooms at Milliways are impeccably clean and have no need of any such gadgets. This is because no one ever goes to them.</p><p>"Wow!" Ranma said after closing the door and wiping his hand on his pants, "Check out this bathroom!"</p><p>"I know! It looks bigger than the house!"</p><p>"I never seen a cha- sandr- one of those big light thingies in a bathroom before!"</p><p>"It's a chandelier, Ranma."</p><p>"Yeah, whatever." Ranma looked around the large, well-lit room for a bit. It was not so much a room as a long hallway. All along the left and right walls there were large multicolored trees with low hanging leaves. Closer to the entrance there were two large fountains with eight shell-like basins aranged in a radial pattern around their bases. On the wall to either side of the entrance there were mirrors, only the image wasn't reversed and when Ranma saw herself move, she had the eerie sensation that she was watching someone else. Looking at the trees again, Ranma noticed there were also strange brown sculptures next to each one. They appeared to be of a man with two heads and three arms. Ranma shook her head and turned to her wife "So...where are we goin ta do this?"</p><p>"I don't know, I don't see any stalls, do you?"</p><p>"Nope. And I hope we find some, cause I got a few calls o' nature comin in here and I'm thinkin it might be somethin important."</p><p>"Oh, well I <i>told</i> you this wasn't a bathroom...can you hold it?"</p><p>"Yeah...for now, anyway. I don't see any people here...let's just go change over by that tree."</p><p>"The one with the green trunk and purple leaves?"</p><p>"Nah, I was thinking more like the one with the red trunk and black leaves," Ranma said, and she and Akane walked over to the big tree with its strings of black leaves like garlands hanging from the branches. "Well," Ranma said with a smirk, "you wanna strip first? Or should I?"</p><p>Akane smiled. "Let's do it together." She put her glass of Nannichuan down on the white and black checkerboard tile and started to undress. Ranma followed suit. Soon they were helping each other needlessly with their garments, caressing each other, fondling sensitive areas of their anatomies, and generally having a good time. The light shining through the black undulating leaves of the "tree" made for an extremely romantic atmosphere and if anyone had bothered to tape Ranma and Akane in action, that being would be able to make a fortune in the lesbian space porn market. Except they would have had to have cut out the ending. Because when both of them were naked...</p><p>Ranma separated from Akane after they had both managed to take each others underpants off at the same time while keeping their lips locked in a kiss. She stood in front of Akane with a nostalgic look in her eye."This brings back memories, don't it?" Ranma laughed. A black tendril of leaves stirred behind her.</p><p>"Yes it sure does." Akane giggled.</p><p>Ranma put her hands in a mock warding gesture as several strings of leaves twitched suspiciously toward her. "Ya ain't gonna slap me or nothin are ya?"</p><p>"Not unless you want me..." Akane began.</p><p>"URK!" Ranma shouted as black leaves attached themselves to Ranma's private parts with a disturbing sucking noise.</p><p>"...to." Akane finished, her eyes wide...but not as wide as Ranma's.</p><p>Ranma's eyes were straight out of Stephen King. If she started to move things with her mind it wouldn't have been that surprising. Instead she started pulling at the leaves and yelling something along the lines of "AAAAAAAH WHAA? GET OFFA ME! HOW DO YA GET THIS THING TA STOP! AAAARRRRRGGHH!" The last bit was more of high-pitched scream than a yell, but then almost anyone in Ranma's unique position would do the same.</p><p>This brings up an interesting question. Are we merely the product of our environments? Granted memory and genetics are a factor but if anyone <i>with</i> the same memories and genetics were to be in the same situation would they not, in effect, be in the same environment? Is it merely the amount of similarity of the total environment that determines the similarity of the response? Grunthos the Flatulent addresses this issue in his ten book series entitled <i>Zen and the Art of Going to the Lavatory</i>. "Every being eats," he writes, "Every being excretes. How many ways can this be done? Count the different kinds of bellybutton lint. You'll have the same answer. In the lavatory, we're all many, and we're all one."</p><p>These were the last words written by Grunthos before his lower intestine became sentient and throttled his brain. Most would no doubt agree with the lower intestine's assessment of Grunthos' talent, but he would perhaps be pleased to know that a mere thirty seconds after Ranma started yelling, thrashing about and screaming...Akane did <i>exactly</i> the same thing.</p><p>After all the commotion, Ranma and Akane took a moment to collect themselves. They were both sitting sprawled on the cold checkerboard floor feeling mistreated, violated, and somehow strangely refreshed.</p><p>Ranma was the first to get up. She ran toward the fountains and when she approached the one that said "oyu" in Hiragana, water streamed out of it. She cupped the water in her hands and splashed it on her face.</p><p>Akane stared at her naked spouse.</p><p>Ranma felt Akane's eyes. "What is it Akane?"</p><p>"Its...your curse..."</p><p>Ranma starting to get worried, looked straight into Akane's eyes, afraid to look down. "W-what about my curse?"</p><p>"I never saw it this up close and...personal before."</p><p>Ranma checked himself quickly and almost fell over in relief. He was male,"Jeez Akane! You had me worried for a second there!"</p><p>Akane stood up "Honestly, Ranma, you really can't tell what sex you are?"</p><p>"Why is that so hard for you ta understand?" Ranma shakes his head, "No, I can't. It's weird... it's like it's completely normal, like nothing's changed...and then I realize Hey! I've got breasts! Hey! I'm shorter for some reason! Hey! My voice is higher! It's so damned normal...sometimes it pisses me off." Ranma gave the "tree" a nasty look, "Like now."</p><p>"The Nannichuan is still over there by the...tree... You could splash it on yourself, you'd be cured..."</p><p>"Yeah, that's funny ain't it?" Ranma sat down on the floor, looking at the glass standing stoically admidst the rumpled mounds of clothing. "After all this time...I could almost do it now...But I ain't gonna."</p><p>"Why not?"Akane asked as she sat down next to him.</p><p>"The truth?" Ranma looked into Akane's eyes as if hoping she'd say she'd rather hear a lie. When no such response came from her he sighed, and continued. "The truth is I'm scared. There are things that I did as girl, memories I got, lessons I learned...If I get myself cured now...I'm afraid all o' that'll just slip away, and it'll be like none of it ever happened."</p><p>"Ranma, that's silly!" But the hand that caressed Ranma's cheek said that somehow, she understood.</p><p>Ranma's own hand fell onto Akane's and he gently pulled it off his face."I know, Akane, but that's the way it is. I don't wanna get cured anymore." Ranma held Akane's hand now between both of his, and, like a priest at a benediction he kissed the tip of Akanes hand and then released her. "I think someone would have ta force me." Ranma said staring into his reflection in the glossy floor. "They'd have to hold me down, keep me from movin. That's the only way I'd take that Nannichuan now...Unless..."</p><p>"Unless?"</p><p>Ranma's eyes locked onto Akane's "Unless you asked me to."</p><p>Akane embraced Ranma tightly, her head on his shoulder. "What did I do, Ranma? What did I do to deserve you?" She was crying.</p><p>Ranma put his arms around her "You were yourself. You were Akane."</p><p>They separated for a brief moment, their eyes looking into each other, then they rejoined in a long, passionate kiss.</p><p>They then proceeded in having wild, sloppy, unprotected sex on the bathroom floor.</p><p>"Ranma?" Akane said after they were done.</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>"We were both just manhandled by a tree a little while ago, weren't we?"</p><p>"Yeah, so?"</p><p>"Well...I mean it was essentially rape..."</p><p>"Whoa..." Ranma sat up "Look Akane, that wasn't rape okay? It was probably just how the toilets work around here."</p><p>"But it was against our will..."</p><p>"Hey we were standin under the thing...we were askin for it."</p><p>"No, Ranma. It wasn't our fault. You have to believe that it wasn't our fault!" Akane was sitting up now.</p><p>"Akane, of COURSE it was our fault! The thing's probably on some kinda mecha whatsit that can tell when somethin that's naked and wants ta take a crap or a piss or whatever is there and just sucks it out of them. If we just let it do its thing we'd a probably been fine."</p><p>"Ranma, do you realize what you're saying? 'If we just let it do its thing?' Ranma that...thing violated us!"</p><p>"But Akane! Its SUPPOSED ta do that! It can't help itself! It can't read minds or nothin! It can't say 'ooh I guess I'll stay away from this one, she looks like she'd like to carry her shit around with her a little longer.'"</p><p>"Is that supposed to make it okay? Oh sure...It's in its nature, 'it can't help it'...sounds like an excuse to me." Akane got to her feet her fists were clenched. "Doesn't it make you angry? That PARASITE took something from us and we'll never get it back..."</p><p>"What, Akane? What did it take? Our feces? Really, Akane, you're makin more out of this than it is."</p><p>"No I'm NOT! It RAPED us Ranma, pure and simple."</p><p>"I'm tellin ya Akane it wasn't rape!" Ranma stood up himself.</p><p>"Oh and why not?"</p><p>"Cause I'm Ranma Saotome and Ranma Saotome don't get raped!" Ranma smiled after saying this. It was supposed to make Akane laugh and make her forget the whole uncomfortable business. It didn't work.</p><p>Akane's mallet materialized in her hand, "RANMA NO..." She stopped the mallet just at the top of its arc. She looked at Ranma with anger and frustration. Then she stomped off toward the tree and the glass of Nannichuan.</p><p>"Where are you goin?"</p><p>"You changed into a guy after it happened. I know why. It's my turn now." Akane got to the glass and gripped it tightly barely managing not to spill half of it on the floor.</p><p>"Akane you ain't thinkin! If ya do somethin like this when you're all upset you're gonna wonder about it the rest of your life!"</p><p>"I don't care. I'm really angry about this. I'm going to become a man. That will fix it."</p><p>"But Akane! That's stupid!"</p><p>"Yes, dear, it is." And Akane poured the water over her head.</p><p>When the change was over Akane was a good two inches taller than Ranma. The jaw was more squared, the face longer, but the most striking change to the face was the eyebrows. Instead of thin lines above the eyes they were now deep, jet-black marks and they were furrowed in anger. The haircut, which looked cute on a girl, looked a little weird now, but was an acceptable style for a boy. The neck was a powerful thing, its tendons clearly visible as Akane's jaw was clenched tight. The muscles in Akane's arms, tightened on the glass and on the mallet still in the right hand, were no longer strangely out of place bulges in lily white skin... now they were impressively veined things of power. In short, Akane looked like a minor deity...and Ranma couldn't help but feel just a tiny bit inadequate.</p><p>"N...n...now then," Akane said. The voice was a high baritone, lower than Ranma's but a good bit higher than Genma's resonant boom. "That didn't make things better at all."</p><p>Ranma didn't say anything. His mind was busy catching up on current events.</p><p>"My voice...sounds weird...I'm taller...but you're right...I hardly noticed it...And it doesn't change anything. Time to try something else..." Akane gripped his mallet.</p><p>"You're goin ta beat the tree...with your mallet?"</p><p>"No, silly," Akane said, and the mallet disappeared. In its place was a giant axe.</p><p>"Hey! I didn't know you could do that!" Ranma exclaimed.</p><p>"Neither did I," said Akane as she advanced toward the tree. She wasn't one to look a gift axe in the blade.</p><p>At that moment Ranma took a mental snap shot of Akane. Akane wielding a giant axe in an incredibly dramatic battle stance in the middle of an alien bathroom about to do away with a glorified toilet. He took this mental snapshot, blew it up to twice normal size and plastered it on a wall in his mind so he could always look at it and say to himself, "There's Akane, the one I love." The fact that Akane was a guy at the time never even crossed his mind until much later.</p><p>Out loud Ranma laughed and said, "Okay, Akane. I'm with you. Let's pulverize this piss plant!" And so they did. Akane slicing it with his axe, and Ranma separating it into tinier bits with his Amaguriken. After they made short work of the first tree, they took down a few more. Ranma would have blasted them with a few Takabisha blasts for good measure, except he wasn't feeling all that confident. What he said to Akane kept echoing through his mind...only the words were twisted around. <i>Ranma Saotome got raped</i>! The words said as he ripped a piece of shit tree with his fingernails. <i>Ranma Saotome got raped!</i> It's a good thing he knew that it wasn't true. Something like that could ruin a guy's self esteem.</p><p>Akane for his part was too busy riding the acidic waves of righteous retribution to wonder about the whys and wherefores of the situation. In his mind he was still a woman, and she wasn't fighting a tree, she was fighting every time Kuno or Happosai copped a feel, Every time she found her undergarments missing, every time a boy accosted her on the street, expecting her to fall in love with them if they managed to beat her up. In the back of Akane's mind he knew that 'pulverizing the piss plant' wasn't going to make things any better, that it was just as bad...maybe even worse than Ranma changing sexes to run away from it all. But just at the moment, it felt good. So there.</p><p>After it was all over, they stood breathing heavily over the twisted mush that was once a line of toilet trees and surveyed their work. The trees were dead, their limbs already beginning to decompose and fall apart. Every now and then the remains would twitch sporadically. The pieces of herbaceous flesh oozed slimy guts everywhere and over everything. They also stank a great deal.</p><p>Akane's axe dissipated.</p><p>Ranma, standing naked over the carnage walked over to the tree that had attacked them and kicked a flopping piece of tentacle off Akane's bra. "We probably shoulda moved our clothes first, huh?" Ranma observed.</p><p>Akane slapped his forehead into his hand.</p><p>Nerima, one week since Ranma and Akane left...</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Nabiki had feelings. She just dealt with them a little differently than most. When she was happy she went to the bank to check her account and maybe buy or sell some stock. When she was angry she grabbed her camera and started taking pictures. When she was bored she'd do yoga stretches. When she was scared, she thought of math equations. When she was depressed, she did something unhealthy, like eat junk food or watch TV. Right now Nabiki was in a lotus position at the low dinner table watching TV while thinking of math equations and smoking one of her father's cigarettes. There was some stupid game show on, the contestants had to perform dangerous stunts for prizes...same old same old.</p><i><p>Multiply the initial investment let's say 30,000,000 yen by e to the power of the rate of interest, I'm not really interested but I've got nothing else to do so let's say 0.04, times the number of years...18...leaving for college soon...</p></i><p>Nabiki contemplated her father's cigarette. She exhaled and blue-white smoke writhed and curled from her lips as if she were some occidental dragon guarding her treasure from hapless adventurers and at any moment she would breath flames of death on them all.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><i><p>Point oh four</p></i> <i>times eighteen ... is the same thing as eighteen times one over twenty-five, so I'm looking for e to the power of eighteen twenty-fifths...and what does this power get me?</i><p>Nabiki was thinking of math equations because she didn't want to think of why it was that she was smoking for the second time in her life. Daddy was with Uncle Saotome and Happosai. They were no doubt on their third round of sake already and it was only just now getting dark. Kasumi and Doctor Tofu were on another date ("Ono-kun" was going to pop the question any time now), and Ranma and Akane...</p><p>Nabiki coughed. Smoking was really such a nasty habit- she didn't see why anyone would start it up.</p><p>She took a long pull off the cigarette and exhaled. Beware the green dragon. Beware.</p><i><p>I need to take the twenty fifth root of e to eighteenth power. Now, e is two point one eight...we'll say it's two. Two to the eighteenth power is like the square of two to the ninth power. Two to the ninth power is...8,16,32,64,128...256. If I died right now... how long would it take someone to notice?</p></i><p>Nabiki sucked on the cigarette. She did some yoga breathing exercises. In with the toxins and carcinogens. Out with the sweet smelling smoke and good feelings...</p><i><p>Two fifty six squared is...40,000 plus 10,000 plus 1,2000...51,200 plus 10,000...61,2000 plus 2,500...63,700 plus 300...64,000 plus 1,200...65,200 plus 300...65,500 plus 36...65,536 Now then to find the twenty fifth root of 65,536... Dammit where the hell are they?</p></i><p>Having reached an impressive snag in her calculations, Nabiki's attention drifted to other things. On the television a man was trying to find an orange flag in a tank of pit vipers.</p><p>Nabiki didn't care. She took a pull off her father's cigarette and blew smoke at the screen. Her hand found the remote. She switched to a nature show. The mating habits of the Asian Elephant. Click. A soap opera "Do you take this man to be your lawfully..." click. An anime. "...can't come with me. You must stay here" "But why?" "Because...because I lo-" Click. A talk show. "Today twenty-one happy couples are going to get married on the air!" Click. The gameshow was apparently the only thing on. The man now had a pit viper dangling from his nose, but he was ecstatic. "Yatta! I got the flag! I got the flag!" The announcer stepped in front of him with a microphone."You won the prize! You get 30,000,000 yen and a trip to Hawaii! What do you have to say?"The announcer shoved the microphone under the man's nose. "Well I was going to wait till after the show, but I can't think of a better time...Sayuri, will you ma-" Click CHUNK. Strike that. There was nothing on. The picture squashed into a horizontal line and then vanished.</p><p>Nabiki stubbed the cigarette into the ashtray. "This is stupid," she said out loud, "My life doesn't revolve around them." She got up to her feet but she didn't go anywhere, she just stared at her ghostly reflection in the black of the TV screen. Because for the last year and a half...her life <i>had</i> revolved around Akane and Ranma. And now they were both beyond her. The game was over. They got their prize and Nabiki... she was left with the vipers.</p><p>After Ranma and Akane left, Nabiki's vast empire of information was quickly dwindling to the occasional question of when they were going to come back. Nabiki, of course had no idea, so she did what she always did when she didn't know something. She set up a betting pool. Nabiki set the odds that Akane and Ranma would return in a month. She felt she was being foolishly optimistic. She didn't think they would be back at all.</p><p>Nabiki had less than a year in Nerima before she would be headed for college. Right now the prospect of going out into the world without Ranma and Akane seemed more and more bleak. They were special to Nabiki. She loved them more than anyone else, even more than Kasumi and Daddy... Of course no one knew this. She showed her love for people by exploiting them.</p><p>Nabiki climbed up the stairs to Akane's room. This was where Ranma and Akane had slept. This was where Nabiki was most likely to find a semblance of the answer to the question that had burning at her since the marriage...Why? This wasn't the first time she'd come up here, but maybe this time would be different.</p><p>Nabiki opened the door. The room was impeccably clean. Kasumi had made the bed that once had appeared hopelessly rumpled, picked up the clothes that had once languished on the floor, intimately intertwined, and put all the nicknacks that had fallen, back onto the nightstand. Nabiki could easily rent the room out now, and no one would ever know that it was once ground zero for a sexual explosion.</p><p>Nabiki approached the bed. She wondered idly if Kasumi had left any trace of the Akane-Ranma encounter under the bed. Nabiki started to crouch down to look but then she stopped...<i>did something move?</i> She froze for a second. <i>It's probably just the draft from the air conditioning...</i> She went the rest of the way down to the floor and bent her head to see. Oddly enough, instead of a cool rush of wind she felt warmth wash over her face. There was a sugary smell...something between freshly baked cookies and cotton candy. It was hard to tell in the dark, but there seemed to be mounds of brightly colored, fuzzy...things. "Okay now this is odd..." Nabiki said... and then the fuzzy things attacked.</p><p>Akane finished draping the rinsed out clothes on the statues of the man with two heads and three arms. She turned to see Ranma poking something with his finger.</p><p>"Please stop doing that, sir madam or thing," The thing said, "If you do not have the proper credits I'm afraid I cannot serve you."</p><p>"Ranma," what are you doing?" Akane was still a man, but he had his hands at his waist and his head was tilted in a ridiculously feminine stance of incredulity.</p><p>"Well it's gonna take a while for the clothes to dry...I thought I might as well check out what this thing is." Ranma was at a rectangular protrusion in the wall. It had several large buttons on it. Three were glowing red, the rest were out. Ranma glanced at Akane and chuckled "Um Akane, I really hate ta say this...but if we ever get back ta Earth you're gonna have to learn to act more like a man."</p><p>"What? This from the one who called me a tomboy every chance he got?"</p><p>"Well," Ranma turned completely around in front of the rectangle thingy and interlaced his fingers behind his head lazily, "you're still a tomboy when you're a girl. But yer a bit of a pansy when you're a guy is all."</p><p>"A pansy? I'll show you how much of a pansy I am!" Akane ran into a flying sidekick aimed for Ranma's head...which Ranma easily dodged. Akane's foot hit the rectangular thing with full force.</p><p>"OUCH Owie owie owie!" The rectangular thing said, " SHARE and ENJOY! SHARE AND ENJOY! SHARE AND-" there was a surge of electrical energy and the mechanical voice distorted and died away, "Doi." Shortly after this, gray rectangular cases with multicolored tops fell to the ground out of the machine along with towels wrapped tightly in plastic.</p><p>"Thanks, Akane!" Ranma patted Akane on the back as Akane got up.</p><p>Akane, for his part wasn't interested in why Ranma was thanking him. He was only interested in maybe finally getting a hit in now that he was a boy. He came in with a punch.</p><p>"Hey..." Ranma exclaimed picking up one of the gray cases, Akane's punch consequently flying over his head. "What's this thing?" Ranma stood back up as he studied the case.</p><p>Akane followed with a simple roundhouse kick aimed at Ranma's exposed sternum.</p><p>Ranma jumped backwards onto the wall and then pushed off the wall, did a summersault in the air over Akane and landed on his feet. "Huh? 'Don't panic'?" Ranma read. The words were inscribed in large friendly hiragana on the case's surface. "Well, I guess that's pretty good advice..."</p><p>"Arrghh!" Akane yelled and lounged at Ranma with a sidekick, and when Ranma jumped to the side, Akane followed through with a roundhouse with the other leg- which Ranma jumped over. Using his momentum from the missed kick, Akane spun into a hook kick that should have nailed Ranma in the temple but instead passed through empty space as Ranma sat down on the floor.</p><p>Ranma pulled at the green top of the case. "Hey it comes open!" He took out something that looked a little like one of Nabiki's graphing calculators only larger with much more buttons and a bigger screen. He poked at a few buttons as he rolled away from Akane's axe kick, which would have broken his collarbone if he had stayed where he was. After his roll he sat on his haunches reading the display on the screen, "'Space is big, really big. You just won't believe how mind-bog'... ba-gu-ri-n-gu-ri...baguringuri?" Ranma jumped over Akane's leg sweep that would have taken his head off and continued, "'...big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way-'" Ranma leaned his head to the side barely avoiding Akane's punch. "'-off to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen...'" Ranma bent backwards as if doing the limbo to avoid Akane's roundhouse kick. He poked a few more buttons on the gadget and then proclaimed "Aw it's just a stupid electronic book." and tossed it onto the ground.</p><p>Akane was just about to "get serious" when what Ranma said suddenly struck him as interesting. "What did you say Ranma?"</p><p>"Huh? Oh nothin just a stupid electronic book. I thought it was a game or somethin. You can go back ta tryin ta hit me if ya want."</p><p>"An electronic book? I've got to see this!" Akane snatched the book off the ground.</p><p>"Really, though, Akane, ya probably oughta get serious about trainin and stop goofin around. Now that you're a guy people are gonna wanna fight ya more... and I don't want ya ta get hurt."</p><p>Akane read the title, "'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.' Ranma do you know what this means?"</p><p>"Yeah. Ya gotta stop goofin around and start doing some real trainin like standin under a waterfall ta increase your ki, or maybe walkin on a fence to improve your balance..."</p><p>Akane's impressive eyebrows furrowed in confusion. "What are you talking about?"</p><p>"Trainin. Ya gotta get serious. I mean sparrin is fun and all but ya ain't goin ta improve nearly enough. Ya gotta go beyond fightin inta life itself...otherwise the Art ain't nothin but a hobby. Why? What are <i>you</i> talkin about?"</p><p>Akane did one of his tilting head revelation things. "Ranma... I think that's the most profound thing I've heard you say." He shook his head. "What I was talking about is this book. Do you realize if we had something like this we might not have had to go through all that with the tree?"</p><p>"Look I know you got it in your head that that thing raped us or somethin but it was nothin. I guess it pissed you off pretty good so it deserved it, but I ain't worried about it."</p><p>"Well <i>I</i> certainly wish it hadn't happened. Look," Akane moved so that Ranma could see what he was doing. "I press the buttons o, te, a, ra, i for bathroom and mi, ri, wa, i, su for Milliways and look what I get..." Pictures appeared on the screen as the words scrolled to the left. After a bit, Ranma pressed a button and the book started talking.</p><p>-The bathrooms at Milliways are the easiest to find in the galaxy. Regardless of any handicap you may have due to species, accident, or too much to drink you will always be able to find them by the small signs along the walls of the restaurant and the large holographic pile of dung above the restrooms themselves...</p><p>"Oh so THAT'S how you knew this was the bathroom!" Akane exclaimed in revelation.</p><p>Ranma buried his forehead in his hand.</p><p>-This makes it possible to go directly to the lavatory without the embarrassment of having to ask a waiter where it is. However, before going there, there are a few things you should know.</p><p>-It is so easy to find the loo, as it were, that even mindless herbaceous creatures can find their way there, most notably the Aragolian Suckstool. These plants, carelessly dropped as seeds by tourists, inevitably find their way to the lavatory, where they feed off the waste products of carbon-based life forms...often without their permission. Many complaints have been lodged against Milliways for the actions of these... enthusiastic creatures, however nothing much is ever accomplished as the restaurant can simply move forward in time to a point where no one remembers what happened.</p><p>-One Krokarn the Well Endowed of Entleberry 7 did manage to confront Milliways on the issue by making his twenty-seven children memorize the events of his assault. They were charged with telling the story to subsequent generations, and so it was that some two thousand years later, when a descendant of Krokarn, Oodleburt the Fairly Well Off, found himself in Milliways, he crouched on one knee, bowed his head in reverence and swore that he would have vengeance on the terrible be-tentacled witches of Milliways that did assault the tower of his ancestor, smiting off his manhood and stealing his riches. Oodleburt, whose people were fond of retelling old legends with the occasional poetic embellishment, would have made good on his oath too... if the head waiter had been able to find his name on his list. While it is true that this usually isn't a problem as you can book reservations retrospectively in advance by simply calling Milliways when you go back to your own time, it was a problem for Oodleburt, as after he was thrown out of the restaurant he was unable to find his spaceship, which had been 'misplaced' by the valet. Consequently, he died from the severe radiation of the destruction of the universe and was therefore unable to book a reservation.</p><p>-In short, a meeting with an Alagorian Suckstool is not a pleasant experience. Only one being in the universe has been known to enjoy it, and this is most likely because the plants regard him as a god, building intricate statues of him out of hardened, reprocessed excrement. This being is Zaphod Beeblebrox.</p><p>-Unless you are Zaphod Beeblebrox, it is best you stay away from the Suckstools and the lavatory of Milliways altogether. Firstly because the experience of having your bowels and bladder cleaned out by a tree is most often an extremely uncomfortable one, secondly because the Suckstool, having little in the way of sensory apparata, is often unable to distinguish between fecal matter and living tissue, and finally because the Suckstools only exist naturally in a hundred year period on Aragol called "The Age of Tree Proctology." They are thus an endangered species and any damage done to them is punishable by death.</p><p>"Shit!" Exclaimed Ranma after the Guide was finished.</p><p>Akane's eyes slowly left the book and found Ranma's. Then they flicked over to their clothes, drying on the statues of Zaphod Beeblebrox. They found Ranma's eyes again and Akane said, "Exactly."</p><p>"The mosquito whines in the ear of those who would slumber. The fly flits about those who would repast. So does this mercenary find me on this night when I would be alone with this facsimile of my new-found love...Matoko!" Kuno crouched and gestured at a double-sized poster of the girl with the bokken Kuno had met earlier. Kuno contemplated the image for a moment, and then stood and faced Nabiki. "Tell me, foul creature, what business have you with me?"</p><p>Nabiki didn't know. She looked around. She was in the Kuno mansion. How did she get here? And why? She had wanted desperately to see Kuno for some reason...what was it? Nabiki kept her face emotionless as she thought these things. She had trained herself not to show confusion. The best trick she had was to reveal what she <i>did</i> know. This made her look like she knew what she was doing and had the added bonus of helping her figure out whatever was bothering her. "The girl," Nabiki pointed at the poster, "Is called Motoko. Not 'Matoko'"</p><p>"How is this so? For I did ask for her name and 'Aoya Matoko' did escape her lips!"</p><p>"You caught her off guard. Her name is Aoyama Motoko. I could give you more information...for a price." Something fell screaming from Nabiki's shoulder. It was bright yellow...and fuzzy. Nabiki noted its position and returned her gaze to Kuno.<i> Stick to what you know,</i> Nabiki told herself.</p><p>"Name it! If I could find out where my love lays her head, I could serenade her with a sonnet, or perhaps show off my prowess with the blade!"</p><p>"Fifty-thousand yen." Nabiki was tempted to call Kuno's bluff, but Kuno was a valuable client and she had to be sure her prices were lower than those of the private investigators around Nerima.</p><p>With a speed that defied logic, Kuno took out his wallet, retrieved fifty thousand yen and slapped into Nabiki's open hand. "Done!"</p><p>"She lives in a all-female dormitory named the Hinatosou in Hinata city. If you want the exact address it will be extra."</p><p>"So far away! And yet only a week ago she traveled as far to reach me. So must I journey the long road to her home, for the fates surely have set this task before me!"</p><p>"Actually, she didn't come here for your sake."</p><p>"Is that so? Then tell me, oh nefarious oracle, what divine wind pushed her delicate sail in my direction?"</p><p>"One hundred thousand yen." Nabiki demanded.</p><p>"You foul usurer of knowledge! Very well..." Kuno handed Nabiki the money.</p><p>"She was chasing a boy named Keitaro. He is the kanrinrin of the Hinatosou and he and another girl living there, a Narusagawa Naru left town after they took their entrance exams for Tokyo University. Motoko thought they might still be around and was convinced that Keitaro was taking advantage of the girl."</p><p>"Ah... A noble beauty indeed. This Keitaro must be punished! You say he's the kanrinrin at this Hinatosou? He no doubt seeks to enslave every woman in that establishment to his evil whims!"</p><p>"No doubt." Nabiki repeated to humor Kuno. She wondered if she was making a mistake. Kitsune, the girl she found nearby when Motoko met Kuno, had told her all of this information and asked only that she not be mentioned if Nabiki told anyone else. Nabiki somehow felt she and Kitsune were similar spirits, that they had something in common. Clients, even ones as good as Kuno, were fairly easy to come by, but proper informants were precious. Nabiki hoped Kuno didn't mess things up too badly. "I guess you're not going after Akane and the pig-tailed girl anymore are you?"</p><p>"Don't speak of such things! Everyone must have been laughing at me! Pointing and saying 'there goeth Kuno the fool! See how he doth lust after one that is taken, and one that is truly a man!' No more! If someone had just explained the matter to me in plain speech I would have understood! But nay, you did seek to twist words around. 'Their mind and soul are one' you spoke, and I believed this to mean they were lovers! I even felt that foul Saotome change and considered it a trick of evil magics. Was I not right? Was it not a curse that I did sense? But I had thought it was Ranma spiriting his concubine away, as I have heard of such things. Never had I suspected that both forms contained the same soul in truth. Who has heard of such nonsense? My sister is in an asylum now, and only yesterday I would have thought she'd be joined by any that believed that a woman and a man could be the same person, and yet I find that I have been the one in the wrong. My honor is hopelessly sullied, the respect I once garnered inhumed and blown to the winds. I have been brought down low and all because no one sought to inform me properly of the truth. Not my servants, not my fellow classmates, and not you."</p><p>Nabiki was impressed, Kuno almost had <i>her</i> going, but she knew that it was always Kuno who jumped to conclusions, and Kuno who refused to listen to reason. And now he was blaming all his problems on <i>her</i>. Nabiki's fingers itched for a camera. Suddenly they found one. Akane could materialize hammers, Daddy could make his head into a gigantic demon, and Kasumi could produce fully cooked meals out of thin air. The only way Nabiki could tell Kasumi was angry was when she did that. Nabiki's thing was cameras. She was never quite sure why...it just was. This one was a Polaroid. She looked through the eyehole at Kuno's somewhat startled expression and pressed the button. Click FLASH! And the picture came out at the bottom. Nabiki ripped it out and shoved it into the pocket of her shorts. She could have killed Kuno just as easily. He was just a means to an end. But though she thought this it didn't make things any better. She was still angry for some reason. Pissed even.</p><p>This hadn't happened in so long she had forgotten what it felt like, or what to do. Normally after she used her camera she would walk away, or...if someone asked about the camera she'd say, "Oh nothing, a girl's got to have a hobby" or something equally light and cheery all the while imagining that she just killed the subject of her photography and wondering what would be done to the body. Many times the people she "killed" would come back from the grave and sometimes she'd have to "kill" them again, but just as often they'd disappear from her life entirely, or would come back as completely different people. And whenever she got a new photo she'd put it in with the old ones in an album and she'd look through the album with a mischievous fondness. But it wasn't working now. Kuno wouldn't die.</p><p>"What do you seek to accomplish by taking my picture, woman?" Kuno asked.</p><p>And before Nabiki could stop herself she replied, " Nothing, I just wanted you to see what a complete <i>moron</i> you are! Listen to yourself! You're going on about how no one told you the truth. EVERYONE told you the truth! You just didn't want to hear it! You were content in your own little world where you were the hero and everyone else was against you. Well maybe they were, and then maybe you just wouldn't let them near you. I bet you knew. You know that? I bet you knew long before Ranma and Akane did their little performance, and you were looking for a way out of the little rut you put yourself in. Ranma wasn't giving you the time of day was he? Akane was just ignoring you wasn't she? They were your closest friends and the only way you knew of talking to them or getting them to notice you was by acting like an idiot. But they've left now. Maybe they'll be back, but even if they return they aren't going to tolerate you anymore. And they're leaving you with no one. No one! And now you want to blame someone for all your problems because it doesn't fit into your little fantasy that you could be the one that's wrong, that you could be the loser. I tried to tell you. I warned you even but you didn't listen. You just wanted more pictures, so I gave them to you. And I gave up."</p><p>"When was this? I do not remember any warnings"</p><p>"I said you were two-timing Akane. That is not anywhere near what an honorable person should be doing. Do you know what you said Mr. Shakespeare? Do you know what came out of the mouth of the human vocabulary vault? 'Oh,' you said, 'So <i>that's</i> two-timing.' And you kept on doing it. And now you want information about this Motoko girl. You want information? How about this: If you go after her like you've gone after all your other 'conquests' you're going to screw things up just like you screw up everything else. She, and everyone at that place will hate you and then gradually as you fail to get a clue, they will start to ignore you. This Keitaro may indeed be a perverted bastard, I never met him, but the one thing I'm almost certain he is not is an evil sorcerer. This is not one your fantasies Kuno. This as real as things here can get. But as much as you enjoy pretending you are some samurai hero, you never learned the most important thing that they teach...Humility. You have been defeated, Kuno. Countless times. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You are a loser. You lost your reputation long ago. You lost Ranma and Akane last week and now..." Nabiki turned to leave she snatched up the yellow ball of fur that had fallen to the ground and turned around. "For what it's worth I think you might have a chance with Motoko. But that's all it is. A chance." She turned and walked to the door. Her back still toward Kuno, Nabiki said, "Good luck with the rest of your life," walked out of the room, and slammed the door.</p><p>Kuno was finally dead. His servants would find him in his room. They would call the paramedics, but they would just shake their heads. He died so young. So young and alone. They would put him in a plot of land close to the city. Only a few people would go to her funeral. Maybe Akane or Ranma would throw dirt on the casket as it went down. And they'd put on the headstone "Here lies Nabiki Tendo."</p><p>Nabiki shook her head. When had she become Kuno?</p><p>Nabiki walked briskly out of the mansion. Most of the traps were disabled, and the ones that weren't were easy to spot. When she got to the genkan, she paused before putting her shoes on and leaving the building. She took out the Polaroid of Kuno. His eyes were slightly wider in the picture, but his features still held a smug, aristocratic and naive handsomeness. Nabiki put a finger to Kuno's face...then she threw the picture in the trashcan beside the door. "Now you've lost me too." She murmured and then left the Kuno mansion behind.</p><p>The world was falling apart. Everyone was separating in twos and leading happy lives. And now Nabiki knew why</p><p>It was the yellow fuzzy thing. The same thing that was now dead and growing cold in Nabiki's hand. It had force fed her emotions she had suppressed for ages. She remembered now why she was going to see Kuno. She was going to go on a date with him. Then she was going to kiss him. Then they would get married and have lots and lots of precious little babies. Thank the gods Kuno had already started his Motoko worship or who knows what might have happened!</p><p>Nabiki had a thing for Kuno, she always had. It was something that wouldn't go away no matter how stupid he acted or how many times he went after other girls. There was a time when she was a little angry with Akane because Kuno was after her and not Nabiki. Then she was angry with Ranma for not being a more intelligent and available version of Kuno and then later for the same reason as Akane. But she took a lot of pictures, "killing" them both a thousand times, and eventually, she grew out of it. She always figured if she really wanted Kuno she could have him, but that there were so many better men out there, and that it really wouldn't fit her lifestyle to get romantically involved with anyone at her age. And that was usually enough for her. But then the warm fuzzy things attacked her and all those suppressed feelings came out again.</p><p>The things had to be stopped...but how?</p><p>They had to have been put under Ranma and Akane's bed by somebody. Happosai would be the most likely candidate, but he was still recovering from Kodachi's wedding present when Akane and Ranma had their change of heart. Besides that sort of thing didn't seem like Happosai's bag. There was Cologne, but why would she want Ranma and Akane to get together? It had to be Soun, Genma, or Nodoka. They were the only ones who definitely wanted Ranma and Akane married. Daddy wasn't that desperate and Genma wasn't intelligent enough...That left Nodoka. She was a wild card. Nabiki knew next to nothing about her, and where was she now? Staying at a friend's house in Juuban. Pretty convenient.</p><p>Yes, it was probably Nodoka, but if Nodoka had that big a secret, what other secrets did she possess? Nabiki didn't want to take any chances on confronting Nodoka without knowing what those chances were. She needed information, and the person most ready and willing to supply that information was Cologne.</p><p>Determined now to end the madness, Nabiki headed for the Nekohanten...</p><p>Kuno watched Nabiki leave from a second story window. His thoughts were a jumbled mess but the overall theme was pretty clear just looking at his eyes. <i>How did she know?</i> Ranma and Akane were gone and Kuno would have to move on but there was Motoko now and...<i> How could she have known?</i></p><p>A young man in a red Chinese shirt and black pants left the restrooms at Milliways, followed by a young woman in a high school uniform. The man was Akane Tendo, the woman Ranma Saotome. They both carried what looked like large cigar boxes in make shift slings made from tying the ends of a towel together over the shoulder. The cigar boxes were, in fact, copies of the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</p><p>"Are ya sure they ain't gonna try ta shoot us or nothin?" Ranma asked, glancing suspiciously around.</p><p>"No, Ranma, I'm telling you, there's no way we can die until we make our reservation. Didn't you hear what the Guide said?" They walked back to their table as Akane explained, "Oodleburt died before he was able to book a reservation! We had our names on the list so we must have called...WILL call this Milliways place...and we HAVEN'T yet...or rather we have...but not yet...I want that book on time travel grammar the guide mentions. Anyway, until we call Milliways we can't die."</p><p>"Hey look!" Ranma exclaimed as she uncrossed her eyes from Akane's explanation, "Isn't that that Zippo bee's wax guy?" She pointed to where a motley crew of four individuals were getting up out of a fairly impressive puff of smoke. One of them was wearing a bath robe saying something along the lines of "It's not so much an afterlife, more a sort of ahutaaraihu." The one Ranma was pointing to had a surplus in arms and heads.</p><p>"You're right!" Akane said. "That's Biibaruburakusu Zeihado-san! Think we should say hello?"</p><p>"Um...Akane? He actually liked what those things did to him remember?"</p><p>"So? Maybe he knows a way to keep them from being so rough. The Suckstools are only innocent plants after all. I almost feel sorry for them..." But he continued to walk to the table and Ranma followed.</p><p>"Akane? Ain't you the one that said they raped us?"</p><p>"That was before we found out what they were. They're endangered species, Ranma! If I knew that I wouldn't have killed so many of them."</p><p>Ranma adjusted the too-tight blouse and put her hands awkwardly at her hips to keep the alarmingly loose panties from slipping. "I'll never understand girls," she said with only a small amount of irony.</p><p>When they got to the table a younger waiter was busily putting out their plates and new glasses of Nannichuan and non-yak urinated apple juice. The plates consisted not only of a steaming hot slab of meat, but also several multicolored side dishes, which were presumably edible.</p><p>"That's right! I was so busy fighting that Suckstool that I forgot how hungry I was!" Ranma and Akane sat in front of their meals quickly and cut into the meat with gusto.</p><p>"Hey this is tender!" Ranma was amazed at how easy it was to cut. "And juicy!"</p><p>Akane and Ranma, both a little awkward with the knife and fork actually put the first piece of meat into their lips at the same time. In one unified motion, they both spat it back onto their plates. "It's also revolting." Akane observed.</p><p>Ranma nodded, "Yeah," she smacked her tongue a couple of times on the roof of her mouth as she wrinkled her nose, "I think it's the plum sauce." Looking up from her plate as she put one of the side items in her mouth so she wouldn't have to see it, Ranma noticed the ceiling. "Hey, I can't see the stars any more!"</p><p>The older waiter happened by at that particular moment. "Madam needn't be worried. We have simply covered the restaurant with a protective shield while this planet's sun goes supernova. Once the radiation is back to acceptable levels we will pull the shield back and you can see the rest of the Apocalypse at your leisure."</p><p>"Okay...Hey Akane, did you get that?"</p><p>"I think so, Ranma." Akane turned to the waiter, "Excuse me my...wife and I were wondering if we could maybe get another steak, without the plum sauce...and maybe cut up a bit more...on rice...with chopsticks."</p><p>The waiter nodded slowly. "I'll fetch the chef for you immediately, Sir," and the waiter left.</p><p>"Did you hear that?" Akane smiled at Ranma, "He called me 'Sir!'"</p><p>"You're gettin a kick outta this, ain't ya?" Ranma smirked. For her own part, she didn't mind being called Akane's wife nearly as much as she would have thought. "So what was he sayin about the shield?"</p><p>"Oh. You see the sun is blowing up right now, and while that's going on they need to make sure nothing gets damaged."</p><p>"That's what I thought, but what was that bit about the Alpo calypso?"</p><p>"The Apakaripusu?"</p><p>"Yeah. That thing."</p><p>"The Apocalypse is from Christianity. You see the Christians believe that at end of the world, Heaven and Hell will engage in a terrible war on Earth."</p><p>"Why the Earth?"</p><p>"Well, that's where the people are. You see Heaven and Hell would be battling over people's souls. And at the time they wrote the Bible they didn't know there were people on other worlds. I guess you could say by 'Earth' they just mean everywhere where there are people."</p><p>"Why can't Heaven and Hell just get along? I mean, I thought the Christians had a pretty neat system, good guys go ta Heaven, bad guys go ta hell. What's the problem?"</p><p>"Oh there's no problem. That will still happen. You see there's something called the Rapture, where all the good people will be taken into heaven before all the fighting starts."</p><p>Ranma crinkled her brow. "Okay let me get this straight...There's gonna be a big fight over who gets the souls on Earth, right? But all the good people are still gonna go ta Heaven and all the bad ones are still gonna go ta Hell?"</p><p>"I don't know that much about it. You could ask Kasumi maybe if we ever get back."</p><p>"It sounds a little stupid ta me. I mean who ever heard of a fight where no one ever wins anythin?" There was a pause as Ranma thought of all the fights she ever had...fights with Pops, fights with Ryoga, fights with Akane...she thought about how many of them she could honestly say she won... "Okay maybe it ain't that stupid. Ya think it could be true?"</p><p>"I don't know, Ranma. I like to think that I and the people I love are good enough people that we won't have to worry about it. But who knows?"</p><p>"Yeah," Ranma said as she looked at the shield ceiling, "I think we're good enough."</p><p>"You're BASTARDS!" exclaimed what appeared to be a giant, pink octopus with a white chef's hat and a mustache. "You're both evil, sadistic and deranged BASTARDS!" The creature was wielding a long curved and dangerous looking meat cleaver in on of its tentacles. "That space cow waited thirty long years for this night. He gave his very life so that you INGRATES could enjoy the meat off his bones! And what do you heartless worms say after you taste the meal so much time and effort was sacrificed on?" He did a whiny voice " 'Ew! THIS has got too much PLUM sauce I can't eat THIS!' What the hell is wrong with you people?"</p><p>"Hey look, I didn't even wanna eat him! He practically threw himself at us!" Ranma defended. "All we want is to have a steak without all the plum sauce. Just slice another piece off and be done with it already!"</p><p>"'Just slice another piece off,' she says. 'Just slice another piece off.' Have you no moral compass? Do you wake up in the morning and wonder where the nursery in the hospital is so you can go throttle some newborns? Or perhaps you bite the heads off puppies so you can see how far you can spit them? You're talking about a thinking, caring creature, not some inanimate piece of furniture!"</p><p>"He's dead now ain't he? Besides, you're the one that killed him."</p><p>"He killed himself. He made the ultimate sacrifice for his art. And you people treat it like he was clipping his toe nails!"</p><p>A creature that looked like a black straw with string arms and the head of a desk troll came up to the table. "Hello Sir, Madam, what seems to be the trouble?"</p><p>"This Jerk is sayin that we're responsible for some space cow's death. I just wanna have my steak without plum sauce."</p><p>The straw man bowed slightly, making Ranma and Akane wonder if his head would come off. "I'm the manager here. I'm very sorry about this. You see, your space cow was a very special space cow. He was dear to all of us. Especially Edrag here," the straw man gestured toward the pink octopus. "We were sad to see him go... They're like children you know. Edrag gets all misty every time he has to cut their heads off."</p><p>Edrag nodded and sniffed.</p><p>"If you'll just be patient. I'll be sure to raise another one of the space cows from infancy, tell him stories, play games with him...teach him to set the dials on the transdimensional flux capacitor..." The manager broke down into sobs leaning on Edrag's shoulder...s.</p><p>"You see what you've done!" Edrag quivered with rage, "You've brought this good man down! He worked his fingers to the bone so that this place would be the best restaurant in the galaxy. But that's not good enough for you is it? You want more, don't you? You want meat WITHOUT PLUM SAUCE!"</p><p>Ranma discovered to her surprise that she had somehow found a bag of potato chips and was crunching them in her mouth as she listened to Edrag's rant, no longer caring. Looking to Akane she found that he was already on his second bag.</p><p>"It just makes me so mad," Edrag continued. "IT MAKES ME SOOOOO MAD!" and with an inhuman scream of rage, Edrag raised his cleaver high in the air.</p><p>"No, Edrag!" warned the manager, "Your war wound!"</p><p>But Edrag was already bringing the cleaver crashing onto the table. Soon afterward Edrag followed, falling on the table and on top of the manager, unconscious. The manager squirmed around for a bit and then gave up and passed out as well.</p><p>AND NOW, THE PUNCH LINE</p><p>Akane finished his second bag of potato chips, wiped his face with a napkin and said, "Good thing I didn't tell them about the dirty knife."</p><p>Shortly afterward a very thin looking person got up on stage, introduced himself and told some very bad jokes after which the shield rolled back, revealing the universe in a less stellar position. Right after the bad joke guy left, a team of about five gunmetal gray stay-puft marshmallow men with laundry machines attached to their chests burst onto the floor. "We have come for the disgracers! Those heretics that dare harm the holy Suckstools of Aragol shall taste our laser cannons!"</p><p>"Oh yeah?" said Ranma standing up, "Well you can't kill us! We haven't made our reservations yet! How dya like THAT."</p><p>"Er, Ranma?" Akane grabbed Ranma's arm looking a little worried. "I just thought of something."</p><p>"What is, Akane?"</p><p>"What if...Nabiki...reserved a table for us?"</p><p>Ranma slowly turned back to the militant team of natural life preservers and smiled weakly. "Any of you guys know martial arts?"</p><p>The one that first spoke fired a large burst of plasma from the laundry machine in his chest. Ranma jumped over the blast flipped over Akane and landed on her feet on the other side of the table, next to Akane. "I guess that's a 'no.' C'mon Akane, lets get outta here!" And they both started to run. Akane doing all he can to keep up with Ranma. Ranma doing all she can to simply keep Akane's panties up.</p><p>~~~~~[END]~~~~~</p><b><p>Notes for pedants</p></b>: I completely and utterly realize that I have done things that should be illegal to the great work that is the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I've tried as much as possible to create scenarios that <i>could</i> happen, but I realize I have probably messed up in a few places. Please let me know where and I'll be sure to note it when I get around to doing a revision. Note however, that I am going mostly by the TV series and Radio show and that in these media, Milliways is, in fact, on Magrathea. For any Ranma or Love Hina pedants the same applies.<b><p>General Notes</p></b>: I do plan on doing a revision on the first chapter, but don't hold your breath. There are a lot of holes in that sucker and I have muster up a lot of gusto to fill them. Thanks to everyone who gave C&amp;C. I have your reviews on file and I plan to use them. In the mean time, I've tried to fix some of the problems of chapter one in this chapter. In that respect I owe particular thanks to Thermopyle and .<p>I doubt if Arthur and the gang will ever have a speaking role in the fic. I'd like to get Marvin in there but no promises, also things are going to move in different directions soon.</p><p>Thanks again for reading and as always, C&amp;C is welcome.</p>
