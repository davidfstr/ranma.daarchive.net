</div>Chapter Three: A new life<p>Akane stared out the window as the rain splattered against the windowpane. She let out a sigh and brushed her hair, which came down to just her shoulders, out of her eyes. She fingered her hair. She had always had it cut shorter then most of her friends. It had just been a preference ever since she was born. She turned around and sat down on her bed and lied down.<p>'Looks like I won't be able to see the sunset tonight,' she thought silently.<p>Akane just stared at the ceiling. She hated missing the sunset. She thought back to when she had seen her first one. It had been with her entire family, she had been maybe 3 or 4, she didn't remember anymore. She just remembered the incredible feeling inside herself. A warm feeling had swept over her body and to this day every time she had watched a sunset, whether with people or by herself, she felt the same warmth and comfort. It was as if she was being protected. Akane sighed again. She really hated missing the sunset.<p>*****<p>Ranma opened his eyes slowly. He waited for his eyes to adjust to the minimal light and looked around. He slowly sat up. He winced slightly but fond that it didn't hurt nearly as much as it had before. He sat upright against the wall and breathed out slowly. He sat in the silence and contemplated his current situation.<p>'Ok, lets see. I'm in a new world and I don't exist in it. No one knows me or has ever heard of me because I don't exist. I'll have to see how my body works here. Hope I can do everything still. What else? Hmm. oh yeah. I'm back to the point in time where I first met Akane back in my world. Guess that means it's nighttime right now,' Ranma thought silently patting his midsection. 'Tofu did one hell of a job. Better then a Kami!'<p>Ranma laughed silently at his private joke then sobered up immediately. He sighed again.<p>'So what's my next move. God, what the hell am I supposed to do? Just start over? Well, maybe Akane will still like me.' Ranma thought hopefully. 'And if I want to meet her on a constant basis I guess I'll have to enter school again. Maybe I'll learn something this time around. Wonder if anything will be the same. Wait, that means I have to deal with Kuno again! Oh well, its worth it just be with her.' Ranma's thoughts drifted off.<p>Moments later he slowly got up and tried to walk around a little. In two hours time he was stretching and doing a few warm up katas. This was what Dr. Tofu walked into.<p>"What are you doing? You should be in bed!" Tofu yelled, surprised that his patient could even move.<p>"Huh? I'm fine. See," Ranma said while finishing up his latest kata, which concluded with a reverse back kick that he kicked up at the last second converting it into an axe kick upwards, flipping his entire body to land upright in a back stance. Dr. Tofu just stared.<p>"But, that wound! It was massive!" Tofu yelled, trying to make sense of the incredible recovery.<p>"Uh, it couldn't have been that bad." Ranma started.<p>"Yes it was. I was hoping all night that you wouldn't die on me, then I find you doing some highly advanced katas that I haven't seen in ages!" Tofu continued to say, not sure of whether to be impressed or shocked.<p>"Really? I'm a fast healer." Ranma said, not too sure have himself either now.<p>'Guess that Kami did more then I thought.' Ranma thought silently.<p>"Well since you seem fine I'd like to talk about a few things, namely who you are and how you got that hideous wound," Tofu said getting to the point.<p>"Err, well my name's Ranma Saotome of the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts," he said proudly. "I got that wound from a fight I got into a bit a away from here. Um, you don't have to worry about it. It happens all the time," Ranma said plainly.<p>Tofu raised his eyebrows but listened intently.<p>"Anything else you want to know?" Ranma asked.<p>"Well, not really except do you have a place to stay? And shouldn't you be going to school instead of getting into those kind of dangerous situations?" Tofu asked.<p>"I don't really have a place to stay anymore, and if it's possible, could you get me enrolled into the nearest high school? I haven't gone to school in a while, training and all." Ranma said slowly, hoping Tofu would believe him.<p>"Well if you want to I can set you up with a room upstairs. I haven't had a training partner in ages and you seem quite adept in the arts. School will be easy for me to set up. I can get you enrolled and into class by tomorrow," Tofu said gladly.<p>"Thank you so much! I don't know how to repay you," Ranma said, not wanting to just take all this generosity.<p>"Well, how bout I hire you as a helper here to pay for the room. That way I'm not just giving it to you. Besides that, there's nothing else that you can do," Tofu said with a smile.<p>"That's cool. You don't know how much this means to me," Ranma said sincerely.<p>"Not a problem," Tofu responded, noting Ranma's sincerity.<p>Tofu looked Ranma up and down. He was impressed with the boy's build and his apparent talent with the art. He was looking forward to training with someone again. Tendo had been someone he was looking into for a partner but he wasn't nearly good enough. Had Soun kept on training, it might be a little different, but ever since his wife had passed away Soun had become much less inclined in the arts.<p>"Well since we're up already, do you want to get you set up with the school?" Tofu asked.<p>"Sure! That would be great," Ranma said.<p>The two got up and walked out the door, Tofu locking it behind him. As the two walked down the street, Tofu noticed Ranma looking around everywhere. Tofu shrugged it off as just curiosity. Had Tofu known what Ranma was looking for, he might have paid a bit more attention.<p>'I wonder if Akane's up yet. Maybe she's out for a morning jog.' Ranma said his head darting around, trying to see if he could sense her presence.<p>The two finally reached the school, and Tofu went in to sign Ranma up. Ranma waited outside saying he wanted to look around and that Tofu could leave as soon as he was done. Ranma jumped outside and found the ledge he had sat at the first day he had come to Furinkan High. There weren't any students in the school yet so he decided to get a little shuteye. When he opened his eyes a little later he found the school bustling with students. That was when he noticed the hentai horde. He stared at their poor formation and the amount of equipment they had on hand. Ranma almost laughed out loud in seeing them. He spotted Kuno a ways away, standing behind a tree, mumbling something to himself. Ranma sighed. He didn't want to have to deal with the big oaf. That was when he heard her.<p>"GET OUT OF MY WAY!" Akane yelled at the top of her lungs charging straight into the group of boys.<p>In a matter of moments they were cleared out, most lying on the ground in pain, some lucky enough to be able to crawl away. Ranma didn't restrain himself as he laughed quietly to himself. Of course Kuno made himself known at that moment.<p>"Truly such a boorish lot. It seems each of them wishes to ask you out, Akane, on the dawn of the day that he actually defeats you," Kuno rambled on.<p>"Oh, it's you Kuno-sempai," Akane said in a monotone voice.<p>"And now, may you fight with me," Kuno said flinging the rose he had been holding at her only to find it snatched out of the air.<p>Akane stared at the area right in front of her, where the rose had just disappeared. Kuno yelled out.<p>"Who dares get in the way of my destiny?" Kuno yelled.<p>Ranma turned around from where he had landed and flipped the rose around in his hand.<p>"Hey! You know, you shouldn't throw roses like these around. Someone might get hurt on the thorns," Ranma said casually.<p>Akane just stared the boy who had appeared out of nowhere. She found herself staring a little too long and quickly looked away when Ranma made eye contact with her. Ranma took the quick turn a different way and sighed.<p>'I hope I can get to know her in this world,' Ranma thought silently with a sad look when a certain buffoon interrupted his thoughts.<p>"You there! Who are you to dare intrude upon my love for Akane Tendo?" Kuno yelled, holding his bokken straight at Ranma.<p>"Stay back! You'll get hurt!" Akane yelled suddenly.<p>"Huh?" Ranma just said with a confused look.<p>"Who are you, boor? Ah, but isn't it custom to give one's name first? Fine then, Mine name I shall give!" Kuno shouted loud enough for everyone in the school to hear.<p>Murmurs were heard throughout.<p>"Hey, who's the new kid?"<p>"No clue, but he's gonna get hurt if he just stands there,"<p>"Yeah,"<p>"He's kinda cute!"<p>Nabiki was up in her room watching down below with a calculating eye.<p>"Who is he?" she thought silently to herself.<p>"My name. is Tatewaki Kuno, Junior group E, captain of the Kendo club, undefeated new star of the high school kendo world, but my peers call me. the BLUE THUNDER OF FURINKAN HIGH!" Kuno bellowed as lighting shot through the air.<p>'I always wondered how he did that,' Ranma said noting the lighting.<p>"Blue Thunder?"<p>"Have you heard of that?"<p>"New to me," Nabiki responded to her associates.<p>"Ok. well I'm staying at Dr. Tofu's clinic," Ranma started.<p>Both Tendo girls looked up at that.<p>'Since when did Tofu get an assistant?' they both thought at the same time.<p>"Go on," Kuno motioned.<p>"And I'm heir to the Saotome School of Anything Goes martial arts!" Ranma said taking off his backpack and throwing it to the ground.<p>Ranma stretched out his body quickly and took up a fighting stance.<p>"I am Ranma Saotome! And I accept your challenge!" he shouted finally.<p>'Ranma Saotome? Anything Goes? Who the hell is this guy?' both Tendo girls thought to themselves.<p>"Prepare yourself," Kuno said giving a warning then shot forward.<p>"Hey, someone's taking on Kuno!"<p>"Is the kid crazy?"<p>"Well, he is cute." the last statement met with a few face faults.<p>Kuno immediately swung his bokken at Ranma only to hit air as Ranma appeared behind him, still holding on the rose. Kuno yelled.<p>"It is folly to loose sight of me Saotome!" Kuno yelled, bringing his bokken down on Ranma's head.<p>"Watch Ou-" Akane started to yell only to find Kuno trying to get his bokken out of the ground.<p>She spotted Ranma standing on the side of tree as if it were the ground.<p>"You might want to watch out Kuno, you might actually hurt someone with that," Ranma scolded.<p>"Die!" Kuno yelled, finally pulling his bokken out of the ground only to feel a burst of air at his chest, as Ranma appeared right in front of him, to close for the bokken to do any damage.<p>"Let me tell you something Kuno, you don't have a chance so give up," Ranma said calmly.<p>'He's good. he got inside Kuno's defenses before he could blink!' Akane thought silently.<p>'What an interesting person,' Nabiki thought to herself, already creating schemes inside her head.<p>That was however when Ranma disappeared and reappeared behind Kuno.<p>"Well, Kuno, I don't really feel like being late for class so lets continue this some other time," Ranma said, and with that bounded into the school, still carrying the rose in his hand.<p>Everyone just stared at Ranma had been, with their mouths wide open. Someone random person had just completely blown off Kuno, the strongest fighter in the school. Akane just looked on in surprise. That was when she noticed Ranma's bag lying on the ground. She slowly went over and picked it up, not really sure why she was helping him out.<p>'There's something, different about him.' Akane's thoughts wandered.<p>Nabiki watched from afar as Akane walked right past Kuno without eve batting an eye. She raised her eyebrow when Akane picked up Ranma's bag and her eyes widened when she noticed Akane walk straight into the school after Ranma, Kuno just standing there with his mouth open ready to say something, nothing coming out.<p>*****<p>Ranma walked around the school and finally found his way to his classroom where he met with his teacher. They talked quickly and Ranma stood outside, waiting to be called in. As he waited his thoughts wandered.<p>'Wonder what Akane thinks of me now? Well, at least I didn't turn into a girl. wait. I don't even know if I still do! I'll have to test that later. until then I'll just have to try and avoid water.'Ranma thought when his thoughts were interrupted by the teacher.<p>*****<p>"His name is Ranma Saotome. Um, I don't really know much more else let's have him tell us about him," the teacher said motioning for Ranma to come in.<p>Akane looked up and got her first real good look at Ranma. He was wearing a bright red Chinese shirt and jet-black pants. From what she had seen earlier she could just imagine how good he was in the art. He had dark black hair that was tied into a ponytail and eyes that were bright blue. Akane found herself staring at him when she heard her name being mentioned.<p>"Huh?" Akane said confused.<p>"I said, Ranma could take a seat behind you," the teacher said a little angrily.<p>Akane lowered her head blushing. A couple of girls were giggling in the corner and Akane could feel the heat rise to her face. As Ranma walked by they accidentally brushed up against each other. A tingling sensation ran through Akane's body.<p>'God, what the hell's wrong with me! Get a grip girl!' she reprimanded herself.<p>Ranma was also finding himself in a similar situation. However, the moment's touch sent a feeling of warmth and comfort. Ranma sighed.<p>'I was almost with her forever. I can't ruin that chance here,' Ranma thought sadly.<p>That was when Akane remembered Ranma's bag. She slowly turned around and looked at him shyly.<p>"Um, here's you bag. You sort of left it outside when you were fighting Kuno." Akane said softly.<p>"Uh, thanks a lot," Ranma said giving Akane a large smile.<p>That was when Ranma remembered the rose in his hand and without even thinking handed it to her.<p>"Uh, here you go." Ranma stuttered out.<p>Akane's heart fluttered at Ranma's smile. She quickly turned around, her face beet red. She heard her friends giggling and she turned and glared at them only to make them laugh harder. She sighed and turned to her studies, trying desperately to study. She found it to be impossible. The rose lay on top of her books.<p>*****<p>As soon as school ended Ranma walked out of the school. He heard many girls sigh as he walked past them. He just ignored them and kept on moving. He had never really liked having all kinds of girls all over him despite what others might say. That was when he noticed the two Tendo sisters near him. He didn't really feel like eavesdropping but couldn't help himself. He attuned his senses to everything around him and silently listened in on Nabiki and Akane.<p>"So what's he like Akane?" Nabiki asked as quietly as she could.<p>"How should I know!" Akane said a bit louder then she intended.<p>She looked up at Ranma to see if had heard and when he made no indication that he had she continued.<p>"Well, he's really nice, different too. I don't know. I bet he's a pervert though." Akane said not very convincingly.<p>"Akane, not all guys are perverts. Just the ones at school," Nabiki said.<p>"Well, I've yet to meet one," Akane responded.<p>"Yeah yeah, well it looks like you have the best chance with him," Nabiki said with a smirk.<p>"Why would I want to go out with him, even if he is handsome, and strong, and nice." Akane started, and then blushed bright red.<p>"Akane, he's been here for one day and everyone's talking about him! The guys are jealous out of their minds and the girls are all falling head over heels for him!" Nabiki stated, sounding more like a schoolgirl then the usually reserved sarcastic tone she used.<p>"Present company as well?" Akane asked.<p>"Of course! And of course you've got him already! I mean, did you see how he was looking at you when he took the rose from Kuno!" Nabiki said.<p>"Probably just staring at my chest," Akane said, again unconvincingly.<p>"Whatever you say," Nabiki said with a shrug.<p>Ranma stopped listening after that and walked on ahead and at Tofu's clinic went in. Of course it was at that moment, the sprinkler system decided to turn on, in Ranma's face. He felt the familiar change take over his body and rushed into the clinic. He hoped no one had seen him. He never noticed the quiet Gosunkugi taping the entire incident then quietly running away laughing to himself. Ranma was walking around looking for a towel when he ran into Tofu. Tofu looked at Ranma-chan and looked at him funny.<p>"Who might you be?" Tofu asked with a questioning look.<p>"Uh, sorry about this. It's me, Ranma Saotome," Ranma said quietly, tugging on his pigtail.<p>Tofu raised his eyebrows.<p>"Jusenkyo curse," Ranma said quickly.<p>Tofu's eyes brightened and he walked into the kitchen and started to heat up some water.<p>"So is this your curse or your original form?" Tofu asked.<p>"My cursed form," Ranma said, not really thinking of it as too much of curse anymore.<p>Tofu heard the lack of caring in his voice and smiled. He brought in the hot water and gave it to Ranma who promptly poured its contents over his head changing himself back.<p>"So, it looks like your quite a bit more interesting then I originally thought!" Tofu said with a smile.<p>"You wouldn't believe half of it. I've been through much more then you can even imagine," Ranma said with a sigh.<p>Tofu frowned slightly when he saw Ranma relax his face. He noticed lines of stress that wasn't there before and a look of extreme tiredness. Ranma was definitely not a normal kid.<p>"Try me," Tofu said wanting to know more of his new resident.<p>". Half the stuff I've been though you wouldn't believe," Ranma said with a tired look.<p>Tofu watched as Ranma quickly fell asleep. He covered him up in a blanket and walked away to tend to his other patients.<p>'I hope things get better for him. Hmm. wonder if he's met Akane, she's about the same age as him.' Tofu thought suddenly to himself.<p>*****<p>Akane sneezed while punching a dummy bag, throwing off her aim, causing her to slip to the side. She ended up rolling her foot slightly and let out a small cry of pain. She grabbed her ankle and held it tightly. She tired to get up but the pain made her sit down again.<p>"Kasumi! Could you come here for a second?" Akane called out.<p>"What is it Akane?" Kasumi yelled back when she spotted Akane on the ground.<p>"Oh my! What did you do?" Kasumi asked worriedly.<p>"I think I sprained my ankle," Akane said gritting her teeth.<p>"I'll Dr. Tofu right away!" Kasumi said when Akane stopped her.<p>"Err, tell Nabiki to call her. umm. could you help me get into the house?" Akane said suddenly.<p>"Of course. Nabiki! Call Dr. Tofu for me could you! Akane's sprained her ankle," Kasumi called out when Soun burst outside.<p>"WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MY DAUGHTER?" Soun yelled.<p>"It's alright father. Help me carry her inside," Kasumi said gently.<p>"Why of course! Are you ok Akane?" Soun asked extremely worriedly.<p>"I'm fine dad, I just need to see Dr. Tofu," Akane said.<p>"I called him, he's sending Ranma over to pick Akane up!" Nabiki said with a smirk.<p>Akane's face turned bright red upon hearing that. Kasumi saw her face and smiled. Soun, completely oblivious, just carried Akane into the house the rest of the way and set her on the couch. Moment later the doorbell rang. Akane tried to keep her face cool by sitting next to the fan.<p>'What's wrong with me! I don't even know him! I can't like him.' Akane said to herself.<p>That was of course when Ranma entered the living room and said something that made Akane blush even more.<p>*****<p>Ranma was sleeping when he heard the phone ring. He looked up and quickly got it, as Tofu had been working with another patient.<p>"Hello, Tofu clinic. This is Ranma speaking," Ranma said.<p>"Hi Ranma, my name's Nabiki T-" Nabiki started.<p>"Hey Nabiki, what's up?" Ranma said, momentarily forgetting that he was supposed to not know her yet.<p>"Uh, not much." Nabiki said with her eyebrow raised. "I mean we have a little problem that requires Dr. Tofu's assistance." Nabiki added quickly, wondering why Ranma was acting so familiar with her.<p>"Can you wait just a minute? He's a little busy right no-" Ranma started when he got off the phone suddenly.<p>Ranma gave the phone to Tofu who had tapped his shoulder and asked for the phone with a smile. Ranma had handed it over and went back to sit down. Moments later Tofu looked up and put the phone down.<p>"It seems Akane's sprained her ankle. If it's ok, can you go pick her up? Just make sure she gets here safely. I can't go right now cause I have to tend to my other patients," Tofu asked.<p>"Not a problem. Nothing will happen to her," Ranma said, with a little too much conviction.<p>Tofu raised his eyebrow but said nothing. Ranma ran out the door and vanished over the roof. Tofu looked out and shook his head. He turned and went back to his patients when he realized Ranma didn't know where the Tendo's lived. He shook his head again. Of course, Tofu didn't realize that Ranma was quite familiar with where the Tendo dojo was. In fact he was there moments after Nabiki had gotten off the phone. He walked up the door and knocked. Kasumi went and got the door and asked Ranma to come in. Kasumi looked him over and smiled.<p>'So this is the boy that has managed to make Akane blush. Not that he wouldn't be able to.' Kasumi said admiring Ranma's physique.<p>"Um, I'm here to get Akane." Ranma said tugging his pigtail.<p>'Shy too.' Kasumi thought with a smirk.<p>They walked into the living room when Kasumi asked a question.<p>"Um, I didn't see a car anywhere. How are you going to get Akane to the clinic? And how on earth did you get here so quickly?" Kasumi asked.<p>"Huh? I ran here. I guess I'll carry her," Ranma said with a straight face.<p>Of course Akane, hearing this blushed bright red and looked down. Ranma saw her but didn't notice the blush so he didn't suspect anything. Of course Ranma's suggestion got Akane thinking, and not in a good way.<p>'He's probably just a pervert trying to feel me up! Argh! I can't believe I thought he was any different!' Akane yelled at herself when she found herself being picked up.<p>"Hey! Put me down!" Akane yelled panicking.<p>"Hey, don't worry about it! I'm just going to carry you so you don't put any pressure on your foot! Besides we'll get there faster this way," Ranma said, making sure not to touch her anywhere that she might object to.<p>As Akane sat there in Ranma's arms she felt a feeling of incredible warmth overcome her body. As she sat there a feeling of absolute security enveloped her. It was just like the feeling she got when she watched the sunset. Akane unconsciously found herself leaning into Ranma's body. Ranma felt this and held a little tighter. Nabiki raised her eyebrow but said nothing. Kasumi also noticed it, but she just smiled. Soun, completely oblivious told Ranma to take care of Akane and to get her to Tofu's quickly.<p>"I assure you Tendo-san, I will make sure nothing happens to Akane, if my life depends on it," Ranma said, not really knowing why he added the last part.<p>Everyone heard the feeling put into the last part and wondered at it, especially Akane. However, she remained silent, enjoying the feeling she was getting, when she quickly scolded herself.<p>'What's going on? Why do I feel so. so safe here,' Akane thought feeling a little sleepy all of a sudden.<p>Ranma bid everyone a good bye and ran out the door. He immediately jumped onto the roof. Soun noticed this and looked at where Ranma had been.<p>'I think I can trust this boy. Wonder who he is,' Soun thought silently.<p>As Ranma ran he looked down at Akane who had fallen asleep in his arms. He unconsciously held her closer and whispered in her ear.<p>"I love you, Akane Tendo."<p>*****<p>Akane found her eyes drooping as Ranma held her in the living room. She wasn't even embarrassed. She didn't feel an ounce of fear in being near him, only an overwhelming feeling of warmth and comfort. She had always found herself get drowsy during the sunset, and this was no different. Suddenly she was lying on the roof of her house. The sun was starting to set. She felt something underneath her head move so she looked up. It was Ranma. She blushed bright red when she saw him.<p>'What am I doing here? And why am I lying on Ranma's stomach?' Akane thought furiously, although she had no intention of moving, not that she would tell anyone.<p>That was when a beautiful red hue stretched across the sky, followed by a series of vibrant colors. A warm breeze blew by. Akane looked up when she noticed there wasn't any pain in her ankle anymore. She turned it around wondering what had happened when Ranma got up, holding Akane close to him. She blushed furiously when he turned her around and stared at her eyes. She found herself drowning in his eyes. She saw Ranma's lips move. It was only a moment later when the words reached her ears.<p>"I love you, Akane Tendo."<p>That was when everything faded. She jumped up and looked around only to come face to face with Dr. Tofu.<p>"Well, looks like our sleeping beauty's woken up," Tofu said cheerfully.<p>Ranma just watched her from a seat a little ways away. Akane saw him and quickly turned away blushing furiously remembering the dream. The dream. It had seemed so real. Akane thought about it and the more she thought the more she found the dream to be more like a memory, a long forgotten memory. She shook her head, putting the thought to the back of her mind. Tofu finished looking at Akane's ankle.<p>"Well it's just a small sprain. I fixed it up so it should be good as new by tomorrow. However, since it's so late I suggest you just get some sleep here. Although I don't know how much sleep you'll get. You've already slept for a couple of hours. You must have been tired. I already asked Ranma to get your stuff and tell your family. They're upstairs in his room. He's graciously offered it up," Tofu said with a slight smirk.<p>Ranma, not hearing the last part just sat obliviously, reading a book on shiatsu he had found in Tofu's collection. Akane blushed, but found herself smiling. Tofu saw this and smiled back.<p>'Looks like I was right. Wonder where they met.' Tofu thought silently.<p>Tofu got up and walked past Ranma and patted him on the shoulder. Ranma looked up then at Akane. Their eyes met and they stared at each other for moment before both of them looked away.<p>"Um, do you need any help getting upstairs?" Ranma offered tugging at his pigtail.<p>Without even thinking she said yes. Akane blushed thinking about her dream again, and the way Ranma had held her before. She kind of hoped that Ranma would pick her up again. Ranma took up the invitation and picked her up into his arms, like he had done before and carried her upstairs, passing Tofu on the way up. Tofu just smiled and walked down.<p>'Looks like a married couple.' Tofu thought with a smirk.<p>Author's Notes: Well, that was longer then I intended it to be. I hope you enjoyed it! Quite waffy, ne? Well, I bet you just can't wait to see what happens when Akane gets into Ranma's room. ^-^ HEY! NOTHING LIKE THAT! Anyways. I hope you liked my story so far! R&amp;R! Oh yeah. is there anyone out there that might want to proofread my fics? If you do, just e-mail me at . Thanks a bunch!
