</div>Chapter 6: Declarations and Old, I Mean, New Friends<p>Deep in the jungle a lone boy walked around aimlessly. He carried with him a large red umbrella. Around his head was a bandana, yellow with black polka dots. He suddenly stopped and looked around. Nothing but trees met his gaze. He screamed in frustration. He sighed, sat down and took out his map, which he held upside down.<p>"Ok, so if I go north," the boy said while pointing south, "I'll be able to reach the nearest town which is. Nerima?"<p>The boy looked at the map again then shrugged his shoulders. He got up again but instead of walking he lifted his index finger.<p>"Bakusai Tenketsu!" he yelled while shooting his finger into the ground.<p>An explosion of dirt and shot into the air hiding the boy and what he was doing. When the dust cleared all that was left was a gaping hole that led into the far reaches of the earth.<p>*****<p>Ranma and Akane approached the Tendo household and stopped at the main gates. They had been talking to each other about various things. Ranma took in a large breath and slowly blew it out. He then looked over to Akane and smiled. He let go of Akane's hand and stepped back, after he had opened the large door. Akane went in and winked. Ranma sat outside for a few minutes when Akane suddenly called for Ranma. He went inside and met Soun at the door. Soun had a confused look on his face but motioned for Ranma to come inside. The three of them all sat down in the main room, Akane and Ranma facing Soun. Soun broke the silence first.<p>"It's nice to see you again Ranma. Um, may I ask what it is you two wanted?" Soun asked.<p>"Well, I wanted to ask you if I could have the permission to take your daughters hand in marriage," Ranma said bowing at the end of his request.<p>Soun just stood unsure of what to say there while Akane blushed slightly.<p>"Wow, this is certainly unexpected. Well, if I may, can I ask for your full name now?" Soun asked.<p>Ranma sat up again and steeled himself for what he knew was going to be hardest part. Akane grabbed his hand and squeezed it tighter. Ranma took in a quick breath and began.<p>"My name. is Ranma. Ranma Saotome," Ranma started and before Soun could interrupt he quickly continued. "I belong to the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts."<p>Soun quickly butted in here.<p>"What are you talking about? Who are you really?" Soun yelled suddenly.<p>Ranma quickly responded with practiced ease.<p>"I am who I said I am."<p>"Then who's your father?" Soun said becoming angry.<p>"My father, is Genma Saotome and my mother is Nodoka Saotome."<p>"That's impossible! She died giving birth to Ranma! Genma and Nodoka never had a child!" Soun said, almost furious.<p>Ranma held his ground. He had reached the point of no return and he was not about to back down. He had only one more card in his deck that he could play and he played it.<p>"What if I can prove it," Ranma said defiantly.<p>"How would you manage to do that? I know for a fact that Ranma was never born. If you are who you say you are then you are currently unregistered, unlisted and unrecognized anywhere on this planet. You don't exist," Soun concluded showing considerable insight.<p>Ranma immediately answered back.<p>"I do exist," Ranma said.<p>He took a deep breath and looked at Soun straight in his eyes. This was now the critical moment. He hoped he could pull it off.<p>*Flashback*<p>Ranma and Akane had both decided that they would announce their engagement to each other to Soun. They were discussing what they were going to say when Ranma stopped.<p>"What about my past? I don't have a past here. What am I going to tell him?" Ranma asked Akane.<p>Akane stood still and thought about it. She looked up with a bright smile.<p>"Let's make one up!" she said cheerfully.<p>Ranma looked at her with a deadpanned expression. Akane scowled at him.<p>"How are we going to make up my entire past?" Ranma asked incredulously.<p>"We don't! We just have to make up your birth," Akane stated quickly.<p>"And how do we do that? Wait, hmm. how about we say this." Ranma said suddenly whispering into Akane's ear.<p>Akane nodded her head then looked at Ranma with a funny look.<p>"It would be better if we said this. and this."<p>"Hmm. yea, ok. and let's add this."<p>"Yea and this."<p>"How about this.?"<p>Akane looked at Ranma with another funny look.<p>"Ranma, you did not save the world. No one would ever believe that," Akane said.<p>"Fine. Well, at least add this."<p>"I guess. ok, and don't forget this."<p>The talked for another ten minutes like this before they started to move again. A few minutes later they ran back to Tofu's. They found him and Kasumi in a stable conversation. They quickly went in and asked Tofu a few questions then left again.<p>*End Flashback*<p>Ranma took in one final breath and started.<p>"I'm going to explain what really happened on the day my mother died. She was giving birth to me when she suddenly died. You know that part. What you don't know is that I survived. The doctors managed to save me. Genma never found out because after Nodoka died he ran off. No one knows why but he did. He ended up killing himself, as you know," Ranma started.<p>He took a deep breath and blew out the excess air. Telling this story was taking a lot out of him. He was already a bad liar and the topic itself was painful to him. He closed his eyes once and opened them, then continued.<p>"The doctors were able to save me but they never could tell Genma because he was gone by this time. I'm told that he left about ten minutes after my mom died. I was born almost an hour later. The hospital took care of me for a while then sent me to the nearest foster home, where I was soon adopted by an old man. I soon found out that he was an old martial arts master. He taught me things until I turned 10. At that point I discovered the old manuscripts of the Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts and I went from there. If you don't believe me I can show you the two secret arts that my father developed that no one else would know," Ranma concluded.<p>Soun stared at Ranma in shock. The boy in front of him claimed to be the son of his best friend who had long since passed away. Now the boy, through a series of events turned out to be willing to fulfill the pact that Genma and he had made years ago. Everything slowly registered into Soun's mind. He suddenly burst out crying.<p>"Our families will be joined!" he cried out.<p>It was at that moment that Nabiki decided to enter the meeting. She looked at everyone, then at Ranma.<p>"What do you mean our families will be joined? Whose families?" Nabiki asked, utterly confused and not liking it on bit.<p>"The two schools will finally become one! Oh Genma, the God's surely look upon us with great favor! How I wish you could see this!" Soun cried out.<p>Nabiki looked on slightly confused. She put together as many pieces together as she could and formed a conclusion. Ranma and Akane, who were currently holding hands, were in some sort of relationship. She shrugged her shoulders.<p>'Didn't realize that Akane was looking for anyone. it might explain her odd behavior before. Love seems to have made her a different person,' Nabiki thought to herself.<p>Akane let out a huge breath that she had been holding. Ranma and Akane looked at Soun one more time.<p>"However, if you don't mind we'd like to set up our wedding. We already have a few things on mind," Ranma stated.<p>That sent Nabiki stumbling to the ground.<p>"What did you say? Did I just hear right? Wedding? You two are getting married? When did this happen?" Nabiki yelled out.<p>"Actually we've known each other for a while sis, I just never let you know. Even I can keep a secret if I want to," Akane said with a wink.<p>Nabiki just stared at Akane for a while then walked out. Ranma burst out laughing while Soun continued to celebrate. Soun got up and took Ranma's hand.<p>"I want to thank you so much for making this old man so happy. I don't know how to thank you for all the wonderful things you've done for me," Soun said.<p>"I know something you can do," Ranma said suddenly.<p>"What? Anything," asked.<p>"Teach my children marital arts," Ranma said with a smile.<p>Soun stopped short and looked at Ranma. Then with a huge smile hugged him. Ranma, for once, let him hug him. He soon broke the embrace and waved his hands.<p>"You two can go now. You've made me so happy. I'm glad to know that my daughter will be in the hands of such a fine young man," Soun said with a large smile.<p>"Um, before we let things get too out of hand. I thought I might want to show you something. Have you ever heard of Jusenkyo?" Ranma asked.<p>Soun stared at Ranma. Thirty minutes later a slightly wet, yet male Ranma, left the Tendo household. Akane followed him. Ranma turned around and laughed. Akane joined him. Soun stood in the main room with a smile.<p>"What an interesting boy, but I'm glad I met him," he said.<p>Nabiki just lay in her bed. Today had officially been the weirdest day of her life. Her younger sister is marrying a guy who just so happens to turn into a girl at the touch of cold water. She turned in her bed and sighed.<p>"With all that went on today, I wouldn't be surprised to see pigs flying."<p>*****<p>The boy with the yellow bandana sat on the ground and yawned. It was getting close to night and he was nowhere near Furinkan from what the map was showing him. He set up his tent and blew out his fire. He crawled into his tent and curled up in his sleeping bag.<p>"Maybe I'll reach Furinkan tomorrow." he whispered.<p>He quickly fell into a deep slumber mumbling names he wouldn't recognize and words he'd never remember. One distinct word stood out as he repeated it a series of times through the night. Neko-ken.<p>*****<p>Ranma and Akane headed back to the Tendo household. They kissed each other and said their good byes. Ranma ran off back to Tofu's and Akane went into her house. As she got up the stairs her two sisters confronted her. They dragged Akane into her room and sat down. The questions came instantly.<p>"How is he like?"<p>"What's his girl form like?"<p>"Is he nice?"<p>"When did you meet him?"<p>"How did you meet him?"<p>Akane just stared at her sisters and burst out laughing. Nabiki and Kasumi looked back and started to laugh too. They did look pretty funny right now. Akane took a deep breath and started to tell them all she could about Ranma, without giving away too much. The three spent the better part of an hour talking to each other. Soon enough Kasumi got up and hugged Akane.<p>"I'm so happy for you Akane," Kasumi said when Akane whispered back into her ear.<p>"And I'm happy for you. I'm sure Tofu's pretty happy too," Akane said with a smirk.<p>Nabiki's highly tuned ear's caught that and another hour of talking commenced. By the end of that hour the three girls were so tired that they fell asleep on the floor. Soun walked in at this point and covered his daughters with a blanket. He kissed them all on the forehead and walked out. He looked at the mantle where his wife's picture lay.<p>"It seems our little babies still need me. I want to be with them for a little longer so I hope you can wait for me, my love," Soun said smiling.<p>He too, soon went to his room and fell asleep.<p>*****<p>Ranma reached Tofu's clinic a few minutes after leaving the Tendo's. Tofu saw Ranma's smile and raised his eyebrow. Ranma however stared right back at Tofu and smiled knowingly. The two stared at each other like this for a few seconds then started to laugh. They said their good nights and went off in their own directions. Ranma and Tofu both were sound asleep by the time they reached their beds.<p>*****<p>Deep in the dark reaches of the Kuno mansion Tatewaki stared at the mirror in his room. He posed a few times while holding his prize katana. He smiled and placed the katana in its sheath and lifted his bokken. Suddenly he turned around and stared at his wall, filled with pictures of Akane.<p>"Oh Akane, I will free you from the wretched hands of that evil Saotome," Kuno said aloud to himself, while waving the bokken in the air. "Then you shall be free to come back to me, your true love! But first I must defeat the cunning Saotome who so cleverly evaded my attacks. His demonic tricks won't work on me anymore for I shall smite him with the edge of my holy sword. He shall feel my power!"<p>Kuno stood laughing in his room. That was of course when he was suddenly smacked in the head with a large metal pan. Kuno immediately sunk into a comatose state on his bed, the object of his unconscious state nowhere to be seen.<p>*****<p>Night came and went as it always did and Akane looked up from the floor in a state of half sleep. She looked around and wondered why her sisters were in her room. She was about to lay down again when she got a glimpse of her clock. She stared at it for a few seconds when her eyes shot open. She jumped up and ran out of the room yelling.<p>"Oh my god! I'm late! I'll never be able to get ready in time!"<p>Nabiki suddenly shot up from Akane's bed her eyes wide open. She immediately followed suit in a very similar fashion. Both were up washed up and dressed in record time. Both of them ran downstairs when they heard someone else from behind them. They both turned around only to see Kasumi run by them in a state of distress. Nabiki and Akane stared at each other and burst out laugh Kasumi immediately turned around and stuck out her tongue. Nabiki and Akane reciprocated in like fashion. All three burst out laughing.<p>"Hurry up you two. I'll have breakfast ready soon," Kasumi said through her laughter.<p>Akane and Nabiki nodded and sat down. Sure enough Kasumi got breakfast ready in record time and the three of them ate together. Soun walked down groggily.<p>"Would like some breakfast father? Kasumi asked.<p>"Yes, that would be great Kasumi," Soun answered sleepily.<p>"Thanks for the food sis," Akane and Nabiki shouted at the same time.<p>Both of them got up and gathered their stuff for school. It was at that moment that Ranma showed up at the front door.<p>"Uh, is anyone home?" Ranma yelled through the house.<p>"I'm right here Ranma!" Akane yelled.<p>"I'm right here Ranma!" Nabiki mocked laughing.<p>Akane stuck out her tongue and ran ahead. Nabiki just stared at where Akane had been and smiled. Whatever Ranma had done, she was grateful. She had never seen Akane so happy. Nabiki looked back at Kasumi and smiled. The two shared a knowing look. Akane had changed and Ranma was at the root of it.<p>"Well we better get used to him being around!" Nabiki said suddenly.<p>"Yes, but I don't think it will be a chore. He's such an interesting boy," Kasumi said contemplatively.<p>"That he is." Nabiki said softly.<p>With that Nabiki waved good-bye and started after Ranma and Akane. She quickly caught up to the couple who were laughing at what seemed to be an inside joke. Nabiki looked at the two then just walked behind them, busy with her own thoughts, like the betting pool that she was currently working on. The three of them eventually reached the school where they were confronted by a new scenario. A large tent lay right in the middle of the school grounds. The hentai horde was looking around the tent, afraid to actually take a look inside it. That was of course when they noticed Akane. They immediately lost interest in the tent and yelled out loud as they began to charge Akane. Suddenly an extremely agitated boy stepped out of the tent.<p>"Will you shut the hell up?" he yelled out.<p>Ranma and Akane just blanched.<p>"R-Ryoga?" Ranma stuttered.<p>The boy turned his attention to Ranma and looked at him.<p>"Hey, how did you know my name?" Ryoga asked.<p>"Ryoga! B-but, how did you get here?" Ranma asked shocked to see Ryoga.<p>"Who are you?" Ryoga asked suspiciously quickly entering into a fighting stance.<p>Ranma eyed the stance carefully. It wasn't a stance that Ranma usually thought of when thinking of Ryoga. Ryoga had always been more of a brawler but the stance he was in was completely geared towards defense and nothing more. That was when Ranma recognized the stance.<p>"Hey! How did you learn that stance?" Ranma yelled out.<p>"I travel a lot," Ryoga answered as if it would answer everything.<p>"So you've seen the Amazons." Ranma muttered.<p>"Look, I don't know who you are or how you know my name but I don't want to fight you! I just want to get to the nearest town," Ryoga stated.<p>"Oh yeah? What town would that be?" Ranma asked rolling his eyes.<p>"Nerima, think you can direct me to it?" Ryoga asked, suddenly hopeful.<p>Akane laughed a little. Ranma smiled as well. It was definitely Ryoga. Ranma extended his hand.<p>"Hey, I didn't mean to startle you. You're in Nerima right now," Ranma said with a smirk.<p>"Huh?" Ryoga said with innocent naivety.<p>"I said, you've reached Nerima," Ranma repeated. "I'll be the first to welcome you to our town. My names Ranma Saotome and this is Akane Tendo. That's her sister Nabiki over there."<p>Akane watched Ranma interact with this new Ryoga. It was completely unlike anything she had ever seen. The two of them were actually having a civil conversation. Ranma was actually trying to befriend Ryoga this time around. Akane smiled.<p>"Well, thanks, I guess. but how do you know who I am?" Ryoga asked.<p>"Oh. uh. I just. you know. heard about you. here and there." Ranma stuttered trying to think of something.<p>"Are you a martial artist too?" Ryoga asked suddenly.<p>"Yea! That's how I heard of you!" Ranma blurted out quickly.<p>"Really? From who?" Ryoga asked curiously.<p>"Uh. you know. a couple of people. I don't remember anymore." Ranma stuttered again.<p>"Well that's cool. Uh, are you any good?" Ryoga asked hoping to have a match.<p>"Damn straight!" Ranma responded.<p>Ryoga stared at Ranma's eyes while Ranma stared right back. Akane groaned. It was too much to hope that they wouldn't end up in some kind of fight it seemed. That was of course when the hentai horde decided to start thinking again.<p>"Hey! Akane's wide open! Attack!" one kid shouted when he was quickly punched in the gut by Ranma.<p>Akane just watched amusedly. Ranma looked at each and every member of the hentai horde, and then smiled an evil smile.<p>"I just wanted to tell you all that Akane is mine. Understand? Touch her and I will hurt you," Ranma said quietly emphasizing each word.<p>The hentai horde backed off, a few of them running in fright. The bravest ones stepped forward brashly.<p>"We have as much right to date her as you do!" one naïve boy declared.<p>That was of course when Akane decided to step in and confirm Ranma's statement.<p>"I'm afraid you guys don't understand. I won't take your crap anymore. Ranma and I are engaged," Akane stated bluntly.<p>Nabiki groaned while whispers spread like wild fire through the school. No one interrupted Akane though.<p>"Now I would appreciate it if you would all just leave me alone or else it won't be Ranma that you'll be watching out for," Akane said with a sweet smile on her face.<p>This time the hentai horde dispersed, some in sadness while others in fear. Akane looked up at Ranma and smiled who smiled back. Nabiki just sighed then yelled at Ranma.<p>"Now why'd you go and do that? I was planning on making some money by selling that information!" Nabiki yelled frustrated.<p>All the plans that she had been working on in the morning had been shot to hell. That was when Ranma spoke up and brightened her day a little.<p>"Why don't you place a bet on Kuno and me? I'm sure he'll be showing up any second now. No one knows how well I fight so put me in as a huge underdog and then bet for me. I'll win," Ranma said.<p>Nabiki brightened considerably then looked at Ranma suspiciously.<p>"You better win Saotome. I don't even know how good you are," Nabiki started when Akane interrupted.<p>"Oh don't worry, Ranma's a hell of a lot better than I am," Akane stated bluntly.<p>Nabiki just stood there shocked, again. Akane, admitting she was weaker than some boy? All hell was going to let loose soon, Nabiki just knew it. Ryoga who had been silent up until now spoke up.<p>"Uh, what's happening? I didn't mean to step in on anything." Ryoga stated quickly.<p>"Don't worry about it. Let me get this over with and we can get you registered in our school," Ranma said.<p>Ryoga just stared at Ranma when what he said clicked in his mind.<p>"SCHOOL?" Ryoga shouted but Ranma was already walking forward with Akane.<p>Nabiki was already setting up the betting pool and quickly amassed a large bet on Kuno. If Ranma won she would win a lot of money.<p>'He better win.' Nabiki thought to herself.<p>Ranma and Akane were walking, Ryoga close behind when a bolt of lightning cut through the air.<p>"What the hell?" Ryoga asked no one in particular.<p>"Step aside fair Akane while I dispatch this foul sorcerer that has enraptured your mind with tales of deceit!" Kuno shouted loudly.<p>Ranma merely rubbed his temples while Akane stared blankly at Kuno. Before Kuno could continue Ranma blurred out of vision only to reappear right in front of Kuno.<p>"Sorry Kuno but I'm going to have to cut you short or else we're gonna be late," Ranma said quickly.<p>In the blink of an eye Ranma pressed over thirty key pressure points then stood up with a smile. To the untrained eye it looked as if Ranma had merely stood up. Ryoga blinked at the speed Ranma just showcased. It was almost inhuman. Even from a third person perspective Ryoga had had trouble seeing everything Ranma had done. If this was just a portion of the skill Ranma possessed. Ryoga felt his hand shaking with excitement.<p>'Finally. someone I can truly test my strength against.' Ryoga thought to himself.<p>Nabiki on the other hand just watched as Ranma walked away from Kuno, who for the moment had frozen solid.<p>"What are you doing Ranma? You said you'd defeat him!" Nabiki yelled.<p>"I did," Ranma stated simply.<p>"Huh?" Nabiki asked when Kuno suddenly fell head first into the ground.<p>All the students that had participated in the betting pool groaned. Nabiki smiled happily. She quickly collected her money and followed Ranma and Akane into the school. As the dust settled Ryoga walked over to Kuno's unconscious body and turned it over. Several bruises littered just Kuno's neck. Ryoga imagined the amount of damage Ranma had just dealt. Ryoga followed Ranma slowly.<p>'Ranma. sounds somehow. familiar. wonder why.' Ryoga thought to himself.<p>He shrugged his shoulders and placed his thoughts to the back of him mind. That was when Ranma popped up right in front of Ryoga startling him. In split second Ryoga had pulled a large red umbrella out from nowhere and pointed it at Ranma's face. Ranma just stared at the tip of the umbrella, which was inches from his nose.<p>"So. you know Mousse, eh?" Ranma said with a smirk.<p>That caused Ryoga to drop his umbrella in shock.<p>"You know Mousse?" Ryoga yelled.<p>"Yup, kind of annoying but a pretty noble guy. Head over heels for Shampoo, right?" Ranma asked.<p>"Yea." Ryoga stuttered. "Wait a minute, was that move you used on Kuno a variation of the Amaguriken?" Ryoga asked.<p>"Yup! Hurry up so we can get you registered!" Ranma said grabbing Ryoga's arm and dragging him into the school, effectively ending the conversation about how much Ranma knew.<p>Ranma took Ryoga to the main office and placed him in the chair.<p>"Now don't move. My friend's coming here to get you registered. I'll see ya later!" Ranma yelled then ran off.<p>Ryoga was about to say something but Ranma was already gone.<p>"School. huh." Ryoga muttered.<p>A few minutes later Dr. Tofu entered the room. Ryoga looked at him and could tell he wasn't just an ordinary person by just the way he was holding himself up.<p>"Ah, you must be Hibiki-kun" Dr. Tofu said with a smile.<p>"Uh, yea." Ryoga answered.<p>"Well why don't we get you set up," Dr. Tofu said with a smile.<p>"Uh. well I don't really have a place to stay and I tend to uh. get lost a lot so I don't think I should register here." Ryoga said, embarrassed to share his curse with a complete stranger.<p>"Not a problem. Ranma already explained the situation to me. I have a room open as it was just vacated today," Tofu said with a smile.<p>Ryoga just sat there. He had just found himself a home and a school to go to. He smiled then bowed low.<p>"Thank you very much."<p>"It's not a problem. Any friend of Ranma is a friend of mine," Tofu said.<p>"Friend. huh." Ryoga said quietly.<p>*****<p>"So you have to convince your father to let me stay in the guest room again," Ranma asked again.<p>"Geez. I'll ask already," Akane answered for the fifth time.<p>"Ok. just making sure." Ranma stated.<p>"Ranma, why are you trying so hard?" Akane suddenly asked.<p>"Huh? Trying to do what?" Ranma asked obliviously.<p>"Trying to keep Ryoga around," Akane said.<p>"I need a training partner and he's the best one out there," Ranma said like it was obvious.<p>"Ok." Akane said with a smirk.<p>"What?" Ranma said looking at Akane.<p>"Nothing." Akane said cryptically.<p>"Whatever." Ranma murmured.<p>That was when they heard a bunch of noise outside the door. They quickly recognized their teacher's voice.<p>"To the left. No! To your other left!" the teacher yelled. "Here just come here, no, don't go down the stairs!"<p>Ranma just stared at the door and burst out laughing. Akane couldn't help but giggle. The rest of the class just stared. No one knew what to think of anything anymore. Akane had just come to school and pronounced that she was suddenly engaged to the hottest guy in the school. There had been a frenzy of questions but Akane had just smiled and sat down in her chair. No one had been able to get anything out of her so they had all moved onto Ranma only to find him completely ignoring everything around him. He was like in another world. Finally they had given up. There was also news of another new student, supposedly the boy from the tent in the middle of the school grounds. No one knew what was going on so they just gave up thinking about it. Finally the screen door opened and the teacher walked in exasperated. Ryoga followed him, his face red with embarrassment.<p>"Everyone, this is Ryoga Hibiki. He just arrived in town. Do you have anything to share with them?" the teacher asked.<p>"Uh. not really." Ryoga said quietly.<p>"Ok. why don't you go sit. next to Hiroshi," the teacher said with a wave.<p>Ryoga quickly found his way to the seat and sat down. Hiroshi leaned over and whispered to Ryoga.<p>"Hey, nice to meet you. So what's with the huge tent?" Hiroshi asked with a smirk.<p>Ryoga looked at Hiroshi once then turned to the front of the room completely blowing Hiroshi off. Hiroshi shrugged his shoulders and turned his attention to the teacher. School went by soon enough and everyone left the classrooms. Ryoga quickly found Ranma and followed him out of the school, making sure not to loose sight of him. As soon as they stepped out Ryoga pointed to Ranma and shouted.<p>"Ranma Saotome. I formally challenge you to a duel in a contest of strength!"<p>Ranma looked at Ryoga and smiled.<p>"I accept."<p>Author's Notes: Well, a pretty long chapter. I have a lot of ideas on where to take this story. I'm willing to listen to other suggestions though so review tons! Now that Ryoga has entered the scene will others follow? And what of the curse Ranma carries unknowingly? Until Next time!
