</div>Erased ~Jingoro~<p>Disclaimer: Ranma ½ belongs to Rumiko Takahashi. Don't sue me because even if you do you won't get anything 'cause I'm dirt poor!<p>"" are used for talking<p>'' are used for thought<p>Chapter One: Happiness fades<p>Ranma stood, anxiously trying to straighten his tie. He looked into the mirror once more. Genma, also dressed up, entered the room and looked in for what seemed like the millionth time to Ranma.<p>"Are you ready, boy?" Genma asked quickly.<p>"Y-yea, I think I'm ready. well as ready as I'll ever be," Ranma answered.<p>"Good, then we should head on down," Genma said motioning for Ranma to follow.<p>Ranma took one last look in the mirror and walked out. He walked through the Tendo household yet it all seemed, different. There were banners and colorful decorations everywhere. People, all dressed up, were running back and forth in a mad rush. Ranma just looked on in an almost daze. That was when Ranma spotted Akane's door. He just stood there and stared for what seemed like an eternity. That was when Kasumi spotted him.<p>"Ranma! Over here! Let me see you for a second," Kasumi called out.<p>"Huh? Oh ok." Ranma said and stumbled over to Kasumi.<p>Kasumi looked Ranma up and down and straightened his tie.<p>"Uh, thanks Kasumi," Ranma thanked.<p>"It's not a problem. Ranma, you look terrible," Kasumi said while observing Ranma's face and the scared look that seemed to be on his face.<p>"Err, it's just. I don't know, am I ready for this? I was thinking about it all night! What if I'm a bad husband? What will Akane say?" Ranma asked, almost pleading for Kasumi to tell him it would be all right.<p>"You'll do fine Ranma. There is absolutely nothing you can't handle. Just think about it as a challenge and overcome it like you always do," Kasumi said pushing the just the right buttons.<p>A light flickered in Ranma's eyes. He stood up straight and suddenly looked a hundred times better.<p>"You're right! It's just a fight that I have to win!" Ranma said boldly.<p>Kasumi quickly hushed him before anything even stupider came out of his mouth.<p>"That's right. Just keep thinking that and go forth," Kasumi said gently and encouragingly.<p>"Thanks Kasumi. I'm really glad you were here. Ok, well I guess I'll see you in a bit," Ranma said, then after a slight pause added, "Onee-san"<p>With that Ranma walked away and to the main room.<p>Kasumi just stood and smiled, then whispered, more to herself, "Welcome to the family."<p>Ranma in the meantime ran into Nabiki who was standing at the foot of the staircase.<p>"So how you holding up?" Nabiki asked with her usual sneer.<p>"Heh, not so bad anymore," Ranma answered back confidently.<p>"Oh? Well, that's good to hear, considering what you might have to deal with later." Nabiki left off.<p>"What do you mean?" Ranma asked getting a little unnerved.<p>"Oh, nothing a little money can't handle I assure you," Nabiki responded when a loud yell was heard from upstairs.<p>"Don't hassle Ranma Nabiki! I'm sure he's got enough on his mind as it is!" Kasumi scolded.<p>"Damn," Nabiki cursed silently.<p>"Looks like I'm free for today," Ranma said with his cocky grin.<p>"Looks like it Saotome," Nabiki said with a sigh.<p>"Hey, don't look too down! I mean, nothing wrong with giving your little brother a few breaks, right?" Ranma said with a genuine smile.<p>Nabiki seeing the smile for what it really was worth, in return, gave Ranma a genuine smile of her own.<p>"Now don't go spreading rumors about this! I'll have you back to being dirt poor soon enough!" Nabiki joked.<p>"Riiiight," Ranma said, joking with her.<p>"Well I have to get going, you know, have to make sure the brides not freaking out," Nabiki said with a little laugh.<p>Ranma joined in and went his own way. He entered the main room to find himself surrounded by people, some he recognized and others he didn't. He spotted his mom right away and walked over to her. Genma was seen right behind her almost as if he was supporting her in case she would faint.<p>"Are you all right mom? Ranma asked worriedly.<p>"Oh, I'm so happy! My boy's finally become a man!" Nodoka said while crying.<p>"Yeah mom, I'm really happy too," Ranma said in complete sincerity.<p>"And here's the boy who complained for years about how his fiancé was just an uncu-," Genma started when Ranma cut him off with a glare that could have melted steel.<p>Genma immediately backed off and silently held his own private victory celebration in his head. Ranma rolled his eyes as he saw Genma's face light up but he gave in. He had to admit if it hadn't been of the old man's stupidity he would never have found him in this situation and this was something he was truly grateful for. So for the first time in a very long time Ranma bowed low and to the surprise of everyone watching he uttered words not even he would have thought he would ever say.<p>"Thank you very much father," Ranma replied loudly enough for everyone around to hear.<p>Genma, completely stunned, almost didn't respond when Nodoka hit him in the back. He immediately bowed back and answered.<p>"You've truly made me proud, my son," Genma said, holding back tears.<p>And just as sudden as it had started it was over. Father and son looked each other in the eyes and they smiled. And with that Ranma turned around and faced the crowd and waited, his father by his side. That was when Ranma's world turned upside down. A loud crash was heard near the entrance, followed by a string of loud curses, some in Japanese and others in Chinese. Ranma immediately turned and looked at Nabiki who was just as startled as everyone else.<p>'Damn, well I know it wasn't Nabiki. Man oh man, why the hell does she have to show up now?' Ranma thought desperately in his head while trying to think up a plan to stop Shampoo's rampage.<p>It was then that Akane decided to show her face. Ranma, about to stop Shampoo, took one glance at Akane and stopped cold. He just stared. Akane was dressed in a large white dress, similar in style to the dress she had worn at their "first" wedding, only it looked a hundred times more beautiful, at least to Ranma. It was that split second that would cost Ranma everything, that last second of beauty. Then it was shattered as he found himself being grabbed by Shampoo then feeling himself vanish. Ranma looked around frantically only to find Akane's horrified expression and her yelling out his name. Ranma looked at Shampoo and noticed a mirror in her right hand, her eyes overflowing with tears. Ranma quickly turned back at Akane and yelled her name one last time before something hit his head and everything went black.<p>*****<p>Akane stood in front of her mirror trying to make sure her dress was absolutely perfect. She pinched her hand lightly; just to make sure it wasn't all just a magnificent dream. She let out a breath that she had been holding and sat down, almost breaking down in happiness. She remembered the moment Ranma had finally confessed to her.<p>*Flashback*<p>They had been sitting together at the park watching the sunset. Ranma had had his eyes closed and seemed to be sleeping. Akane had just watched over him when Ranma opened his eyes suddenly. Akane found herself drowning in those big blue eyes. Then Akane saw Ranma's mouth move. Akane just sat there for a moment when a tear rolled down her cheek. Not sure what had happened she quickly wiped it away only to find another one falling from her other eye. Ranma had jumped worriedly only to find Akane crying, Akane not even sure why when Ranma's words hit her full on. It was a complete shock to the system and her body went numb, and then as Ranma had slowly yet gently put his arms around her she had melted, melted right into his warm body just to lay there for a few minutes. That was when Akane remembered to respond.<p>"I love you too, oh my God I love you so much," Akane had whispered quietly.<p>"I'll never leave you Akane, no matter what, I'll always be here by your side. Forever," Ranma had said.<p>They stared at the beautiful sunset together in each other's arms. It was maybe two, three hours before they had finally gotten up to go home.<p>*End Flashback*<p>Akane giggled a little after thinking back. The next day both of them had had to stay in bed as they had both caught a nasty cold. They had been miserable for the rest of the day. Akane looked at the mirror again and smiled. It had been the most wonderful day in her entire life. Then Akane quickly blushed, thinking of what could possibly do better. That was when Kasumi entered her room. Kasumi took one look at her sister and giggled.<p>"Kasumi!" Akane yelled embarrassed.<p>"A little anxious are we?" Kasumi asked with a smile.<p>Akane merely put her head down, her face as red as a tomato. Kasumi just smiled.<p>"Don't worry, Ranma is just as nervous as you are, and quite excited if I might add," Kasumi said. "I just talked to him. You're marrying a fine young man, Akane. I'm happy for you," Kasumi said.<p>Akane looked up and gave a huge smile.<p>"I know, and, thank you so much," Akane said trying to hold back her tears.<p>It was at that moment that Akane's life was shattered. A large crash resounded in her room. Akane's eyes lit up, a look of fear reflected in her eyes. Kasumi saw the look and ran out the door only to be passed by Akane. Akane rushed down the stairs, thoughts screaming in her head.<p>'Oh God, please don't screw this one up too! Oh God, I don't know if I can go through another one! Why do I have to deal with this!' Akane's thoughts screamed.<p>That was when a streak of purple rushed in front of her. Akane quickly turned her head to find Ranma looking like a deer caught in the headlights. That was when their eyes met, and Ranma froze. Akane just stared for a moment into his eyes when Shampoo wrapped her arms around Ranma, a mirror in her hand tears rushing from her eyes. It was at that moment that one of her tears hit the mirror and a bright light enveloped the pair. Akane screamed out Ranma's name, tears now flowing from her eyes. Akane heard her voice being screamed one last time then everything went silent. Her body went numb and she fell to the ground. People all around her started moving and yelling but nothing registered in her mind. Only one thought was in her head.<p>'Let Ranma be safe. I don't care about anything else. Just let Ranma return to me. I just want to be with him now. Nothing more.'<p>As she stared at the spot where ranma had vanished a flicker of light appeared and vanished. Another flicker. Then all of a sudden a drop of blood dripped onto the ground. It was as if everything had stopped. A crimson drop of blood appeared out of nowhere and hung suspended for a few seconds then dropped. It splashed onto the ground and splashed away into nothing. Akane's eyes grew round as the tears began to run down her face. It was at that time that everything really did stop. Then everything vanished. Everything around her crumbling, but she wasn't even aware of it. Only one thought remained. Ranma. And then, everything changed.<p>Author's notes: Well, started off really happy didn't it? Didn't end too happy though. What happened? What kinds of changes have occurred? WHAT'S GOING ON? Well, I guess I'm the only on who knows. Until next time! ^-^. Don't flame me now, but do review the story. Oh, and yes I am working on my other story's, its just I have this bad habit of writing whatever ideas pop into my crazy head of mine. Sorry, but I will write the other ones so just be patient. Thanks a bunch for the support!
