</div> <b>High Pressure</b>                  Disclaimer: Characters    and setting are the property of Rumiko Takahashi, I'm just borrowing them    for a little non-profit fun.<p>Thanks for the feedback: glazedlookineyes101, goku905041, obsidian-fox,    dogbertcarroll, Katie, Hououza, Shinigami<p>Mousse awoke to silence. The mummy was in China dealing with some    village business; her absence was expected. Shampoo had gone out just    before closing to deliver a take-out order. She should have been back. The    silence filling the Nekohauten mocked Mousse. Shampoo, the girl he loved,    should have been back… unless she decided to sneak into Ranma Saotome's    bedroom again.<p>"Oh Shampoo, why can't you see that I'm the one who loves you?" Mousse    sighed hopelessly and reached for his glasses. He tried to cheer himself    up with the knowledge that he and Shampoo would be spending the whole day    working together at the restaurant.<p>The Chinese boy gathered his bathing supplies and headed to the    bathhouse on the next block. He stashed his glasses in a cubical, found an    empty stool, lathered up then dumped a bucket of cool water over his head.    Mousse flapped his wings to get rid of excess water then used his beak to    re-oil and smooth his ruffled feathers. Once he was done grooming the duck    flew across the bathhouse. He landed in the warm pool and transformed back    into a fit, seventeen-year old boy with long hair.<p>For the most part the other patrons didn't look twice. The bathhouse    was not only the closest one to the Nekohauten, it was also just four    blocks from the Tendo Dojo. Mousse's morning routine was down right tame    when compared to the antics that went on when Ranma tried to keep Happosai    from harassing the women bathers.<p>Mousse collected his belongings and went back to find the Nekohauten    dark and empty. The myopic boy looked resigned as he went to work getting    the restaurant ready for business. Opening time came and went without    Shampoo. Dishes piled up in the sink as Mousse tried to keep up with the    incoming orders. He stuck it out through the lunch rush then closed up    shop and went to look for his beloved; his glasses were perched on top of    his head.<p>Mousse spotted a vaguely familiar blur and hope overrode common sense.    "My dearest Shampoo, I was so worried!"<p>He had a split second to realize that the chest under his cheek was    much to firm and flat to belong to Shampoo then he was flying backward.    Mousse impacted the wall with enough force to crack bricks. After a few    seconds the hidden weapons master pried himself out of the wall and    slumped to the ground. When he landed it jarred his glasses; they slid off    the top of his head and landed on his nose.<p>Ranma stood across the street, his fists were clenched, he was    breathing hard and his battle aura was blazing around him. "I am not    Shampoo." He continued to himself. "Shampoo grabs me like that. You grab    Shampoo; you thought I was Shampoo. I wouldn't kill Shampoo for glomping    me, I shouldn't kill you."<p>"Ranma?" Akane asked. She put a hand on his arm. Ranma jumped.<p>"Saotome, how dare you distract me when Shampoo is missing."<p>"Missing? When?" Ranma's voice gained the chill calm of the soul of    ice.<p>"Last night, she went out to make a delivery. She never came back."<p>"Where was she going?" Ranma demanded.<p>"Oh, I didn't think of that." Mousse dug a slip of paper out of his    loose sleeves. "The delivery was to the Cat Temple."<p>"Airen will come for Shampoo." The lavender haired beauty pouted.<p>"Why don't you want to be my bride?" Her giant, feline capturer sounded    hurt.<p>"Is too dull waiting for rescue, must be why violent girl is always in    bad mood. Shampoo call Ranma, tell him rescue needed."<p>"No!"<p>Shampoo stalked across the temple to confront her kidnapper, her eyes    glittered angrily. "Shampoo call!"<p>"Humph! It won't do any good. Go ahead and call, see if I care."<p>Voices drifted through the open door. "I thought this place was    abandoned." Akane said.<p>"Why does it have to be c-cats?"<p>"Airen!" Shampoo rushed past her kidnapper, her arms spread wide to    greet her beloved groom to be. She trampled Mousse on her way to Ranma.    "Ranma come save Shampoo from too, too tragic fate!"<p>"Shampoo will loose her human form if she leaves my side." The ghost    cat, Mao Mo Lin laughed triumphantly. "She has no choice but to become my    bride!"<p>Ranma's eyes glowed with terror and fury.<p>"Unless…" Shampoo began.<p>"Let her go." The ice in Ranma's voice cracked.<p>"She will be my bride!" The ghost cat insisted petulantly.<p>"I won't let you rape her." Ranma's voice dropped into a low growl. As    he stalked toward the ghost cat his posture shifted. His movements became    more fluid, less human. He bared his teeth in an angry snarl.<p>"All Shampoo needs is kiss from true love!" Shampoo interjected    helpfully.<p>"I'll kiss you my beloved Shampoo!" Mousse declared.<p>Shampoo booted her myopic suitor in the face. "Kiss from one Shampoo    loves." The girl clarified disdainfully.<p>"Grrrrow!" The low snarl drew all eyes to Ranma. He slashed at the    ghost cat with his ki-claws. Where they intersected the cat's form    empyreal wisps of the cat's substance dissipated.<p>Akane, Mousse and Shampoo watched with stunned expressions as Ranma    brutally tore through Mao Mo Lin's defenses and scattered his substance to    the wind. Only seconds later the giant bell that hung from Mao Mo Lin's    collar fell to the ground as the neck that supported it was rent asunder.    Ranma pounced on the bell and ripped it to pieces.<p>"Saotome… killed him." Mousse said, his voice full of disbelief.<p>"Is ghost cat, is already dead." Shampoo argued. "Airen save Shampoo;    is good." The Amazon girl smiled and took a tentative step toward Ranma.    He drew back in response. His back arched and he raised one hand to    emphasize his warning hiss.<p>Akane gasped as Ranma eyed the two Amazons with hostile intent. She ran    to the courtyard fountain and sent a spray of water toward them. "Get out    of here, now!"<p>Mousse spread his wings and took to the skies. Shampoo lost herself in    the crowd of cats milling around the temple. Then the lavender Siamese    settled in to watch.<p>Akane crouched in front of Ranma and held out her hand. "Here kitty,    kitty." She called tentatively.<p>Ranma came to her with the fluid grace of a cat but instead of allowing    her to pet him he nudged her into the temple.<p>Uncertainly Akane settled herself into a chair. Ranma prowled the    outskirts of the room. He glared out into the courtyard as he waited for    an attack.<p>Nabiki assessed her escort out of the corner of her eye. With her    breasts bound and her hair pulled back Ukyo Kuonji made a very pretty    young man, but the oversized spatula slung across her back warned people    against mistaking 'his' slender build for a lack of fighting ability.<p>After Ranma's display over Kodachi Nabiki wondered if he expected other    people to mistake Ukyo for a guy or if he still subconsciously thought of    his old pal Ucchan as a boy. It was a little bit sexist, but considering    what she believed had happened it wasn't totally unjustified, Ranma    probably wouldn't have been a target in his male form.<p>As the pair made their way off school grounds Tanaka intercepted them,    he held a folder nervously in his hands. "After this we're even." He said    as he planted himself in front of Nabiki. "I mean he's my dad, but I'm    still stealing a police officers notes."<p>"Not stealing, photocopying." Nabiki said. "I told you to put the notes    back."<p>"I did what you told me, it's still a big deal."<p>"Alright, consider your slate clean." Nabiki said as she held out her    hand. Tanaka handed her the folder and hurried away. Ukyo watched    curiously then with concern as Nabiki skimmed through the folder. Her face    paled as she read.<p>What the notes said wasn't exactly a surprise. All they did was confirm    her suspicions, still seeing it in black and white left her feeling    queasy. Certain phrases seemed to leap out at her: Strands of red hair    found caught in a ring. Signs of recent sexual activity discovered on one    body. Regurgitated blood and alcohol found several meters from the bodies.    Dismembered. Four parallel blades of near perfect sharpness.<p>Knowledge was power, Nabiki thought, but you never knew enough. Now she    knew what happened, she still didn't know what to do. Nabiki walked along    side Ukyo, lost in her thoughts. She tried to make a plan, all the while    feeling completely out of her depth.<p>"It's been over a week since Ranchan or Akane came to school." Ukyo    commented. "Mind telling me what's going on?"<p>"The whole school is talking." Nabiki said distractedly. "Ranma went    cat on Kuno. Akane's the only one who can control him when he's like    that."<p>"I heard." Ukyo replied. "I even dug up the old rumors about Genma    putting my Ranchan through some idiot training that makes him so scared of    cats that he goes crazy around them. What I want to know is what happened    to make Ranma as scared of Kuno as he is of cats."<p>Nabiki stopped dead in her tracks. "Ch! I can't believe I didn't put it    together. Ranma was sort of okay until he got splashed, then Kuno goes    into his whole Pig-tailed Girl routine. 'When his fear reaches its peak he    yowls.' It was never the cats that triggered the Nekoken; it was fear.    Uncle Saotome's idiot technique made Ranma ailuphobic, but all it takes is    terror, not cats."<p>"What the hell did Kuno do?" Ukyo demanded.<p>"Kuno-baby?" Nabiki said defensively. "He just picked the wrong day to    express his affections. He may have been the idiot who came up with    'defeat Akane in combat to date her' but he always held back. He's still    waiting for Akane to let him win. He'd never do anything like that to    anyone, especially not to Akane or his Pig-tailed Girl. I'd never sell    pictures of Akane or Ranma to him if he were like that."<p>"Then who?" Ukyo reached back to grasp her primary weapon.<p>Nabiki snorted. "Ranma took care of that. Vengeance has been served. If    you want to be useful tell me how to fix him."<p>Ukyo's hand fell away from her spatula. Her eyes dropped to the    pavement.<p>"Yeah, well let me know if you think of anything." Nabiki scaled back    the sarcasm in her voice. "Seriously, if you think of anything let me    know, I'm at a loss."<p>The pair continued on in disheartened silence until reaching the    Tendo's street.<p>Akane appeared at the other end of the street. Ranma stalked along    beside her on all fours. He shot Nabiki and Ukyo a warning glare then    apparently recognized them and relaxed marginally.<p>"He went cat again?" Nabiki asked rhetorically. "What set him off this    time?"<p>Ukyo studied her best friend and fiancé with a wary sort of curiosity.    She took a tentative step toward the feline-minded boy and held out her    hand as if he were a real cat.<p>Akane grimaced. "Mao Mo Lin."<p>"The normal stuff." Nabiki summed up with relief.<p>Ranma sniffed at Ukyo's fingers tentatively then allowed the    okonomiyaki chef to awkwardly pat his head.<p>"Sure, normal stuff, only he's been like that for hours." Akane    complained.<p>Nabiki thought about that for a few minutes.<p>Ukyo's comfort level had grown. She progressed from uncertain pats to    rubbing Ranma's back comfortingly. Ranma responded by pressing closer to    her. Ukyo hugged him tightly and whispered in his ear. "I'm sorry you… got    hurt."<p>Akane twitched jealously as Neko-Ranma relaxed bonelessly against Ukyo.    "Chill, he didn't seek her out." Nabiki hissed. "You're still the one he    chooses and I told you this isn't a good time for your temper."<p>Nabiki stepped away from Akane, in a normal voice she said. "I suppose    if other fears can send him into the Nekoken it makes sense that it's    harder to bring him out of it if he's already severely stressed. Akane,    what finally got him back to normal after the deal with Kuno?"<p>"That time was different, he acted so hurt. I just held her until she    fell asleep." Akane said. "This time, I don't know. Ranma was… I thought    he was going to go after Shampoo and Mousse once he was done with Mao Mo    Lin. Nabiki, you can't kill a ghost, right?"<p>"Since you have to be dead to be a ghost it would seem redundant."    Nabiki replied. "Ranma did some damage I take it."<p>Akane nodded.<p>"Ranchan purrs?" Ukyo commented. The other two didn't really pay    attention. "I didn't think humans could purr."<p>"So he's more secure and more aggressive in his male form regardless of    whether he's thinking human or cat." Nabiki said to herself.<p>"He was pretty aggressive with Kuno." Akane remarked.<p>"Aggressive or desperate to get away?" Nabiki asked. "Did he go hide in    your arms after one swipe at the Ghost Cat?"<p>"Ranma kept attacking until there was nothing left of Mao Mo Lin."    Akane said with a shiver.<p>"K'so." Nabiki said. Ukyo and Akane gave her a questioning look. "You    haven't noticed? Lately Ranma refers to his girl-form as either unreal or    as a separate person. He practically goes into shock if his curse gets    activated. As a guy he's overly protective and volatile. As a girl he's    terrified. Kuno and Gosunkugi are suddenly at the top of his threat list;    Ukyo, if you see Tsubasa you should probably tell him to run. The same    pattern holds true when he's neko. Akane, do you remember if any of those    books Kasumi borrowed from Tofu dealt with psychology? Ch, I wish Dr. Tofu    were still around."<p>"Umm, guys? I think he's asleep?" Ukyo said.<p>"Well both of you are martial artists, I'm sure you can figure out how    to get him inside." Nabiki said as she turned into the front gate. "I'm    going to talk to Kasumi, grasping at straws and all that."</p>
