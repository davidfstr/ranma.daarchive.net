</div> <b>Restoration</b>                  Disclaimer: Characters    and setting are the property of Rumiko Takahashi, I'm just borrowing them    for a little non-profit fun.<p><b>Four Months Prior</b><p>Ranma watched the approaching girl out of the corner of his eye but he    overtly ignored her presence until he'd finished the workout he'd planned    for the day.<p>"Akane, hi."<p>"Hey." Akane took a seat on a bench near the entranceway. She stared at    her feet. Several minutes passed.<p>"If your dad's making you come I won't mention it to anyone if you    stop." Ranma said when the silence became too uncomfortable.<p>"Daddy isn't making me come."<p>Ranma waited. "Well if you're going to keep showing up, you might as    well <b>talk</b> to me."<p>"I don't want to risk us getting in an argument. I'll loose my temper,    you could get hurt."<p>Ranma quietly increased the distance between them. "I don't break that    easily."<p>"How can you say that after what happened?"<p>Ranma's fists clenched. "I <b>used</b> to <b>let</b> you hit me. It was    the quickest way to get you over being angry. I'm not going to do that    anymore."<p>"You couldn't stop me right now."<p>Ranma's nails dug into his palms. "K'so! Then why don't you learn to    control your own stupid temper?" He paused then smirked poisonously and    added. "We both know there's nothing <b>cute</b> about your temper."<p>Anger, quickly chased by guilt flashed across Akane's face. She fled    the courtyard.<p>Ranma knew she'd be crying in a few seconds. He sat down and pulled his    knees up to his chest. "What are you going to do if she doesn't come    back?" He whispered.<p>"Nihao Ranma." Shampoo gave the boy a quick hug while Mousse grumbled.    "Brought Duck-boy for practicing."<p>"Thanks. Hey Mousse, wanna spar?"<p>Ranma grinned at the horrified expression on Mousse's face. "A joke.    I've been doing paired katas with Pop but that's as much as I want to push    it." Ranma didn't tell Mousse that the inherent unpredictability in a real    spar would probably defeat him. "What did ya bring?"<p>"Is called Risk." Shampoo said.<p>"The goal is to conquer the world." Mousse said.<p>"Big surprise. Shampoo, ya ever notice he's got some odd interests?"<p>"You win more often than I do."<p>"Hey, I'm saving the world from you." Ranma replied.<p>"Let's just play." Mousse said.<p>"I'll go get the water, you guys set up." Ranma said.<p>Forty minutes later.<p>"Ah-ha! I control Iceland. Soon all of Europe will fall!"<p>"Stupid Mousse, Ranma's army not defeated."<p>"You always take his side." Mousse sulked.<p>"Put on your glasses, then you can count the spots on the dice for    yourself." Ranma said. "My one army is worth ten of yours."<p>"Next turn I shall return and overwhelm your position."<p>"That what Mousse say last time, but too busy replenishing forces lost    to Shampoo in South America."<p>"Why don't you attack him from Africa for once?" Mousse suggested.    "We're both going to loose if Ranma keeps all of Asia."<p>"Shampoo like Ranma better." The lavender-haired girl replied blithely.<p>"Shampoo! How could you?"<p>"Next time you could bring Ukyo." Ranma offered.<p>"So they can both gang up on me with you?" Mousse asked.<p>"Ucchan's competitive." Ranma said.<p>"So's Shampoo. The best I could hope for is that they'd both ignore me    and attack one another."<p>"Shampoo and Ranma rule world together." Shampoo declared.<p>"I guess if you could find Bacon-breath…"<p>"Is Ranma sure?" Shampoo asked, suddenly serious.<p>"Yeah, I'm not going to freak out, but you're on my side."<p>"I think I'm getting the worst of this arrangement." Mousse commented.<p>"Yep, Shampoo agrees."<p>"Cologne wanted us back by the lunch rush." Mousse said. "We'll have to    finish tomorrow."<p>"Mousse go. Shampoo catch up later."<p>"But!" Mousse protested.<p>Shampoo sighed. "Won't be long."<p>Ranma went to get some hot water.<p>"Go or get kicked out. Shampoo going to talk."<p>"Fine."<p>Shampoo waited for the door to slam. "Ranma do okay. Shampoo didn't see    difference between when you boy-type or girl-type."<p>"One of the nurses pointed out guys can get raped too; like that was    supposed to help."<p>"Ranma really be okay with both pig-boy and Mousse here?"<p>"I'll never get out of here if I can't deal with being around more than    one guy at a time."<p>"How are you doing boy?" Genma asked.<p>"Why don't you tell me?" Ranma said confidently then walked to the    center of the courtyard and started one of the most difficult katas he    knew.<p>Genma watched. Each movement flowed smoothly into the next. Ranma was    precise but not mechanical, his expression was one of intense focus, still    he was smiling. When he finished Genma shrugged. "You could have picked a    more challenging pace."<p>"Like you could do better old man." Ranma laughed. "Even doped to the    gills I did it right and you know it."<p>Ranma spotted Dr. Soy hanging back n the shadow of the doorway while he    talked with his father. "Hey Doc! What'd they say? Can I stop taking the    crap and go home?"<p>"Ranma…"<p>"No! What more do they want from me? I spent a fucking hour in a room    with Kuno Tatewaki; age seventeen, blah, blah, blah, while in girl-form    and I didn't even try to kill him. You wanted to hit him after the first    fifteen minutes. And he wasn't even trying to get a date with you. Do ya    want me to have the girls drag Happosai back here? What do I have to!"<p>"Ranma, stop it." The doctor said tiredly. "When we asked you to hold a    cat you screamed and fainted. The potential still exists that…"<p>"I've been like that since I was ten years old! It's normal, I never    killed anyone until… you know." Ranma argued. "I'm in control, I'm not    overreacting anymore, I'm normal for me. Geeze, I was restrained with    Kuno. If I hadn't been trying to prove a point I would have knocked him    out after the first minute or so."<p>"I know, but you have no idea how badly you scare people. Ranma, as    best as we can determine you killed those six bastards in a matter of    seconds using just your bare hands. And you entered that fight at a severe    disadvantage. The police aren't sure they could stop you if you lost    control, even if they were willing to shoot you."<p>"They can't keep me here if I don't want to stay. I could walk out    right now and no one would stop me. Once your stupid drugs ware off    there's no way they'd get me back."<p>"I know and I'm trusting you not to do that. That's why I never    mentioned it when their security precautions became worthless almost two    months ago."<p>Ranma turned and smashed his fist into a concrete bench; it shattered.    He stalked away, several seconds later they heard a door slam.<p>"Sometimes I wish I'd never found that manual." Genma said quietly.    "But if Ranma hadn't known the cat-fist… I don't think they would have    been satisfied until they'd killed him. Soun is well respected, perhaps if    he talked to them. At this point I'd even considered recognizing Shampoo's    claim, I doubt they'd object to her taking the boy out of the country."<p>"Let me think about how to ease Ranma's ailophobia before anyone    resorts to desperate measures."<p>"Get the hell out of my way Tendo!"<p>"Ukyo, what do you think you're going to do? This won't help. We have    to be reasonable." Nabiki protested.<p>"I'm going to go down there and I'm going to <b>reason</b> with those    jackasses!" Ukyo hefted a bag of exploding flour to demonstrate what she    meant by 'reason with'.<p>Mousse and Shampoo each grabbed an arm and forcibly sat the enraged    Okonomiyaki Chef down.<p>"We don't go around randomly beating people up!" Nabiki exclaimed.<p>"Sure we do." Ukyo replied.<p>"Not when they're members of the city council, judges, the like. You    don't pick fights with non-martial artists."<p>"Mercenary Girl is right. This not the way." Shampoo said. "Why bother    reasoning? We take Ranma, let lost boy lead until no hope of being    followed then we live happily ever after."<p>"You're right, Ryoga could get us out of the country but we should get    some funds together first and I'll bring my grill."<p>"Shampoo get supplies for Ranma."<p>Both girls left with plans on how to loose the other without Ryoga or    Ranma noticing until it was too late.<p>It was the middle of the night. It had been six hours. The chair shoved    under the door handle was a strong indicator that Ranma didn't want to    talk to anyone.<p>He hadn't been bluffing when he said he could leave if he chose to.    He'd learned to keep dozens of alternate plans in his head at any minute.    Cologne, Happosai, Pantyhose, Ryoga and his pop would beat him in a fight.    Shampoo and Soun would probably take him two times out of three. Ukyo and    Mousse might win, anyone beneath their level wouldn't last long enough for    the handicap placed on him to become crippling.<p>Once he could leave the minor details to muscle memory again he'd be    better than ever. The next time Pantyhose came by it was going to be fun…<p>Except they weren't going to let him go and the Doc had to go and put    it on his honor not to run. He had to get control of over the Nekoken, by    definition the Nekoken wasn't controllable. Saotome Ranma didn't loose.<p>They weren't happy with him getting things back to the way it had been.    He was going to have to do better.<p>Ranma focused inward. The Nekoken was a mesh of gray floating under the    surface of his mind, closer to the surface than it ever had been before.    He prodded at it. It was survival instincts and power and not much else.    It was folded up and tucked away right now but it was waiting for him to    need it then it would wrap around him like a blanket, velvet on the inside    steel-wool on the outside.<p>There was nothing to stop him from controlling it. In the pit he'd just    wanted something to protect him. Now he wanted control. He wanted to    protect himself, not to depend on anything else. He wasn't going to run    away. He wasn't going to loose.<p>"Mr. Saotome, I… your son had… Ranma went into the Nekoken last night.    There was no trigger. We tried activating his curse; we tried sedating    him. His condition remains unchanged."<p>"Akane." Genma stated. "She can bring him out of it."<p>"She calms him down. The sedative should have done the same thing."<p>"You could try using her."<p>"You know he can be dangerous. They fought the last time they talked    and if she gets close enough to touch him he could kill her with a swipe    of his hand."<p>"They always fight, it doesn't mean anything."<p>"Maybe it does now."<p>"I don't care."<p>"What if Ranma does care and your friend Soun might object to    endangering his daughter. We're not going to let anyone go inside that    room."<p>"Ranma always comes out of it, you'll see."<p>"Maybe Ranma will come out if when he falls asleep naturally, but he is    the only person I've heard of who ever recovered. Elder Cologne arranged    for me to talk to a member of the Musk's feline sect, they created the    Nekoken. None of the children they put through the process ever regained    their human personas. I've hypothesized that it didn't take as firmly in    Ranma's case, because he isn't genetically part cat. Still the fact that    he went under while he was alone in a sealed room worries me."<p>"Uncle Saotome, could you teach me the Umisenken?"<p>"That technique is sealed Akane."<p>"I want to see Ranma; they won't let me." Akane said. "I want to help."<p>Genma hesitated. "I'd teach you if I could. Akane, you might be able to    leave a ki-blast. All you have to do is find a dominant emotion and    channel it. The umisenken is different; you have to be able to control    your ki. All of your emotions have to be under your control."<p>"Good, I've got to learn to do that anyway. When can we start?"<p><b>Present</b><p>"Ranma! I'm so glad you're back!" Soun exclaimed enfolding the slight    redhead in an enthusiastic hug. Ranma's muscles went rigid. Soun quickly    released him. "Um, sorry about that."<p>"It's okay."<p>Nabiki looked Ranma over. "So, how'd you change their minds?"<p>"Went through the cat-fist training again. I didn't loose my head."<p>Genma laughed and slapped his son on the shoulder. "The hardest thing    about the training was keeping the cats in the room long enough to    convince them that the boy wasn't afraid."<p>"What was wrong with the cats?" Nabiki asked.<p>Ranma stared into her eyes. "They were terrified of me." Nabiki gulped.    Ranma's pupils were slitted, like a cat's.<p>"I got here as quickly as I could!" Ryoga panted. "Am I too late for    the party?"<p>Akane groaned. Shampoo stomped out of the dojo and grabbed Ryoga's ear.    "Stupid lost boy, was supposed to be surprise party!"<p>"I'm glad it's you rather than me." Mousse commented to Ryoga then    turned to Ranma. "Hey Ranma."<p>"Hi Mousse."<p>"Well Ranma, once again you've managed to surprise and impress me."    Cologne said. "Congratulations on mastering the Nekoken."<p>"Thanks."<p>"Ranchan, the food's getting cold, and the weight is warping the    table." Ukyo said. She loosely wrapped an arm around Ranma's waist as she    dumped hot water over his head. "Kasumi, Shampoo and I all cooked." She    leaned close and whispered. "Don't worry, we put Akane in charge of    decorating."<p>Akane stuck her tongue out at Ukyo as she claimed Ranma's other side.    "Welcome home, Ranma."<p>The End (Thank goodness, I was getting tired of this    story)</p>
